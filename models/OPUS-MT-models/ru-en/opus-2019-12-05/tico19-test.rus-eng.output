The rapidly growing rate of cumulative incidence of coronvirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronvirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union / European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thereby affirming that, despite the different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to improve the preparedness for COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown ethiology were reported in Uhan in the Chinese province of Hubei.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the source of the infection was a new type of coronvirus, now known as the Coronvirus of Type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
From now on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a Coronvirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, about 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 are in light form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with most of them recovering.
In approximately 14 per cent of cases, COVID-19 is developed into a more severe form of disease with a need for hospitalization, while in the remaining 6 per cent takes a critical form when intensive treatment is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyses trends in cumulative COVID-19 in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compares them to those in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We are also comparing the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the United Kingdom with the data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU / EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of which returned from Uhan in the Chinese province of Hubei.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, were reported by Italy alone.
Determination of the cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8: 00 the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country worldwide from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK and to compare them with those for Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 was calculated for a 14-day COVID-19, based on the normal current COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also submitted a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8: 00 on 15 March 2020, compared with the figures for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
The 14-day trends in the EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom of Great Britain have been generally consistent with those in the Chinese province of Hubei (figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and in the UK as a whole began to increase on or around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp increase (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but in all other EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom there were similar trends in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, compared to the same in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8: 00 on 15 March in 15 other EU / EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom.
The observed trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in the response of national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for a COVID-19 analysis, including "catch-up" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 required intensive treatment, while the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already as full as possible.
To date, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases are available for COVID-19 patients to hospitals and (or) the EU / EEA intensive care unit (not reported).
However, such data should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data on the number of reported cases and deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant difference in the number of beds in intensive care and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth up-to-date ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for the modelling of the downloading of health systems with estimates of the hospitalization of COVID-19 in each EU / EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90 per cent.
As cases are now grouped into certain regions of the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, it is recommended that information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, where possible, in the second level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive treatment, for example, in affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the most recent ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, an operational, proactive and integrated approach, followed by a shift from deterrence to minimization, is important to contain the proliferation of SARS-COV-2, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have sufficient time to reflect, adopt and adjust their response if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can increase their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-COV-2 and to reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks, the health-care system in other EU / EEA countries will be faced with the influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of a coronvirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-COV-2) coronvirus has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have now died in China and elsewhere and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologic SARS-CoV virus, which led to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted from volatile mice and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article offers a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject matter of the study.
We will look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethics, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of further current and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring event (China New Year), which fell on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to remain at home during and for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus.
In view of the high level of similarity with the Coronvirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease a Coronvirus infection of 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and rapidly spread throughout the country, followed by almost 50 other countries around the world.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "the enemy number one for society" and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), more than 200 publications on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, have been available in less than two months, beginning with the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronvirus-related disease, the coronvirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts that have been known so far about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not fatal to the human being and are mainly responsible for about 15 per cent of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have faced two high-pathogenic human coronviruses, that is, the coronvirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) and the coronvirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease in China initially in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronvirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported to the National Health Commission of the Republic of China from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
The genetic sequence of the virus was released seven days later.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was recorded in Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, health workers were known to be infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted to a human being.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhan and urban public transport was discontinued.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that 21 of the 41 patients with a confirmed coronvirus had direct contact with the seafood market in Uhan, which was considered a starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronvirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already entered some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scope and risk of a flash is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) was presented on the basis of a multi-centric clinical study attended by 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 was affected by all age groups, but was mostly affected by people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is higher for men (0.31 / 100,000) than for women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters, mainly in Hubei province and in the surrounding regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days were spent from the symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 days (3.0-7.2 days).
On average, 9.5 (4.8-13) days were spent from the time of the symptoms to the death.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale transport on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 per cent (95 per cent CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and the adjusted mortality rate for patients was 3.06 per cent (95 per cent CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were: gender (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronviruses are a subfamily of large, single-injected, lumbar viruses.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta-coronviruses are known to affect people.
In the case of damage by SARS and MERS, the glycoprotein of the boneless peppers (S) is connected to the cell receptors of the type 2 angiotenzine (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In cytoplasm, the virus RNA genome is released; after the virus genome is replicated, the genome RNA, together with the ulterior glycoproteins and the nucleocapide proteins, generates virion-containing vesicules, which then merge with the membrane cell and release the virus.
The first reports on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 were released on January 10, 2020.
It is found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronvirus, the genome of which is 99.98% similar to the 10 consistent samples collected at the first outbreak of the disease on the Huanan seafood market in Uhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than the MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-ton respiratory epitelium of human beings through an enlightening electronic microscopy.
It is found that the human enzyme ACE2 is a recipe for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is less connected to the ACE2 farm than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a disease of less gravity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate an previously unknown short-lived protein, coded orf3b, and a classified protein, coded orf8.
Orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play some role in the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the authors & apos; team, headed by Zhou (Zhou), submitted a report on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-scale ACE2 farm, with a resolution of 2.9 children, in conjunction with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which included open and closed formalities, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which is evidence of the recognition and infection of the coronvirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for a drug screening to control SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
The source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is known to be volatile mice from which the virus was transmitted to human beings through cyvet and camels, respectively.
By means of a phylogenetic comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are volatile mice, since the new virus is 96% identical to two similar coronviruses, namely, the coronviruses of the volatile mice SL-COVZX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, it is not known which type has become an intermediate owner, which has enabled the virus to overcome the species barrier and infect the human being; the way of transmission is still to be found.
Mr. Ji, with his colleagues, suggested that the virus & apos; s vectors from bats to humans were snakes, during which a homological recombination in S-protein took place.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolin - long-sized mammals that are fed by ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronvirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between both genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence are not yet available (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
Under laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and to heat up to 56 ° C within 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectors, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.
There is currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure 4).
In general, the virus is first recognized by the owner as a congenital immune system through the identification receptor (PRR), including the C-type, Toll-like receptors, ND-like receptors and RIGI-like receptors.
Through a variety of mechanisms, the virus is causing the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendrit cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which contain the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocitosis of the macrophags with regard to viral antigens.
However, the N-protein SARS-CoV can avoid immune response.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
The T-lymphocytes, including the T-cells CD4 + and CD8 +, play an important role in the protection of the body.
The T-cells of CD4 + encourage the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and the T-cells of CD8 + directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-Helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokens that help protect cells.
However, the coronvirus can inculcate the functions of T-cells by causing their programmed death.
Humane immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against virus infection.
For example, the antibodies from a recovering patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system & apos; s hyperreaction entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which could cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario result in polyorganic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is a cluster-based phenomenon, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune disorders.
According to data from the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-COV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days.
However, the examination of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
More recently, the above-mentioned study, based on data from the demography of 8,866 cases, found that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time-frame for quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with a disease that is unsymptomable.
A 14-day quarantine for persons in contact with or infected with the virus has become a common practice.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only manifestation or are accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, respiratory, muscle, head, head, throat, eye, chest, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
In some patients, a week after the disease began, there was an abdomen and (or) hypoxia.
In difficult cases, the disease has been rapidly advanced, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
High-temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the chest.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 found the following symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% wet and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilator.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies on cases of family infection and transmission of the virus from the undiagnosed.
The comparative results were obtained in 2012 from a study of patients with MERS-CoV, who also had high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and abdomen (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which is much higher than for patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate for MERS than for COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99-100 per cent), dry cough (29-75 per cent), abdomen (40-42 per cent), diarrhoea (20-25 per cent) and throat pain (13-25 per cent), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 14-20 per cent.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 had a 2 per cent mortality rate, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 66.576.
In comparison with this rate, the mortality rate for SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
In an earlier study, the baseline reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than the latter two.
Thus, it will be much more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The cluster is often present when a family or group of people are infected, gathered together for any reason or found to be on transport, for example on a cruise liner.
Patients often went to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with the infected or the sick during the last two weeks before the disease began.
However, according to the data provided in the reports, people could be carrying the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients who had been released from the hospital could again be carrying the virus, a disturbing signal for an extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 have had lymphophenia with a leukocytes level of < 4 x 109 / L, including a leukocytes level of < 1 x 109 / L, as well as an increased asparagin-amino transferase and virus.
Some patients had high levels of liver, muscle and myogloin enzyme, and most patients had high levels of C-reactive protein and blood-borne aritrocytes.
The D-dimer level, the blood fibrine degradation product, had been increased and the number of lymphocytes had been steadily reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 found pathology in an X-ray examination of the thorax, with unevenness on both sides, or with a type of "moth glass" in the lungs.
Patients often experience abnormally pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (PRS).
In the development of the PRC, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis result in a significant disruption of the gas exchange.
The Type I and II pneumocite dysfunction reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study often coincide with the worst cases.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed that pneumocites had been subtracted, that there had been a hyaline membrane and an intertissue lymph infiltration, and that the multi-nuclear synthetic cells in the lung patients who had died of the disease were consistent with the pathology of the virus infection and the ORC, and were similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion used for the detection of COVID-19 was the SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of a polymetic chain reaction with a reverse transcripse (PCR with a reverse transcripse).
However, given the high level of false results that could accelerate the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical evidence (no longer relying solely on a reverse transcribe PCR).
The same was true for SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and the results of the X-ray study.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Fen Zhang (Feng Zhang), described a protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology, based on the reapplication of CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this methodology allows for the detection of synthetic parts of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of 20 x 10-18 mol / L to 200 x 10-18 mol / L (10-100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample), with the use of the indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Because of the lack of experience in dealing with a previously unknown coronvirus, doctors can mostly provide only support therapy to patients with COVID-19, while at the same time trying to use any therapeutic methods that have been used or offered in the treatment of other coronviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus-related diseases (table 2) .2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunity-giving agents, steroids, the plasma of the recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of a recovering patient should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to control the virus.
In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2, most of it is light, and may be less affected by other organs that express ACE2, such as the ventricular tract and kidneys.
However, the disruption of work and the refusal of respiratory organs are the main threat and cause of death.
Thus, in order to facilitate symptoms and save lives, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, is critical, depending on the gravity of the current disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary bleeding method used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, the maintenance of water-salt balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytokine storm is a result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process developed in response to a series of cytokins, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokins have caused immunizations for the release of a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ORC and polyoric deficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in the case of patients in difficult condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and totylismab, monocronal antibodies serving as an interlekin-6 inhibitor were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other methods for the treatment of cytokine storm based on the suppression of immunity include the modulation of the immune response aimed at the control of T-cells; the blockade on the production of cytokins IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the suppression of anus-kinaza; the use of panatomaba; the use of citokin signal suppressors 4; and the inhibition of histondeacetalase.
In order to reduce the impact of inflammatory processes on the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as a source of immunity.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful for the treatment of severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly detract from the projection.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium-sized doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of a belt, a nucleotid analog, has proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, the belt-breaker also showed that other single-kidney RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS, could be suppressed.
Based on these data, Gilead provided the drug to China for a couple of research on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are looking forward to.
In addition, baricinab, α-interferon, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin were suggested as options for treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Lapinavir / ritinavir combination treatment may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side actions.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients who have been treated for contagious diseases for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease or for the protection of a healthy population has been used for a long time.
And in fact, the blood of a recovering patient often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to control a pathogen.
There are antibodies in an immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and target them.
On the basis of this premise, a group of patients who had been treated by COVID-19 were released from the blood samples and then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
In 24 hours, their symptoms have improved, the rate of inflammation and the virus load has decreased, and the blood saturation has increased with oxygen.
However, to propose a large-scale application of this method before specific treatment is carried out, there is a need for the verification and explanation that has not yet been carried out.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the deficiencies associated with the use of plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overencourage the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma is required to treat patients in a critical state.
It is not easy to design and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify the B cells of the recovering patients and to define the genetic code of the effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to the mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies according to the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most effective components are still unknown or undefined, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific treatment, COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative methods for treating patients with light and medium symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe phase of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and the Lian Hua Qin Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest number of successful patients with COVID-19 were in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for 87 per cent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ninya (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for only about 30 per cent of the patients with COVID-19, the lowest rate of recovery (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment should take into account many other factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment only in Western medicine and combined treatment in Western and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the hospital was significantly lower for patients who were treated in a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in Western methods.
The most striking is the fact that the proportion of patients who have begun to suffer from symptoms (from light to heavy) has been significantly lower in a group that was treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine methods than in a group that was treated only in Western methods (7.4 per cent compared with 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared with 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely monitored research, carried out on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to have, where possible, a description of the mechanism for action and an explanation of the effectiveness or combination of components used in Chinese traditional medicine.
Patients suspected of or confirmed by COVID-19 are mostly in severe fear of acute or even fatal disease, and those who are closed to quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as by-actions of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, may cause even greater concern and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of a disease caused by the SARS virus, a number of mental diseases were reported, including chronic depression, high anxiety, panic, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, diphtheria and even suicidal behaviour.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, may increase people & apos; s concern and guilt over the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and mental assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and in contact with them, as well as to all other persons who require it.
Psychological support should establish multidisciplinary mental health teams, ensure that information on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans is made available on a regular and accurate basis, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the transmission chain from infected animals and people to sensitive owners and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done on the development of S-protein-based vaccines aimed at developing long-term and highly active neutralizing antibodies and (or) protection immunity to SARS-CoV.
In the course of animal research, live, weakened SARS vaccines were developed.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions in the case of age-based patients, the model of death-rate infection and the degree of protection against zonosis virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new case has been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of diseases caused by the MERS virus, emerging in the Middle East and spread to other regions through the conservation of zoonic sources in endemic habitats, continue to occur.
In order to combat MERS, strategies have been developed for vaccination using the intoxicated virus, DNA plasma, virus vectors, nanomaterials, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, some of which have been assessed on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (on average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of the coronviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also related to the high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a forward-looking model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical data submitted to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prediction of the current disease in patients with COVID-19 (table (Table 33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study, 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive treatment were more likely to have primary diseases and complications, and they were much older than those who did not (on average 66 years of age compared to 51 years), in favour of age being a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31 / 100,000 against 0.27 / 100,000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to develop severe damage to myocardium and aritmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also contact ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and primary diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
The deviations found in laboratory studies: the C-response level in blood reflects the gravity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed that it be considered as a potential predictive factor for the current disease, for the response to therapy and for the final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between the C-Reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the COVID-19 projection.
In addition, an increased level of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagin-amino transferase, alanin-amino transferase and creatinkinase can also be predicted.
These enzymes, in large quantities, are provided by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
They are therefore traditionally the markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, the data from the X-ray examination of the chest and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are the guarantors of immunity that are widely used in infectious diseases as supplementary treatment to reduce the gravity of the inflammatory process.
Since the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with severe forms of SARS has been widespread, many survivors have developed an avascular osteonecrosis that has caused life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if steroids are to be used to treat patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be provided in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients are suffering from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to withstand long periods of quarantine, to cope with high levels of uncertainty and to observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to address the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, they must be given psychological advice and long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronviruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or do not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which makes epidemiological monitoring very difficult.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was considered to occur when patients are severely ill, with most cases not having occurred at an early stage of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently working hard to declare universal quarantine in the city of Uhan and neighbouring cities, and to extend the quarantine regime for almost all the population, which was introduced to break the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain.
While these measures are very damaging to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new patients being identified is declining, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic calculation is that the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of the stalling will last three to four months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter, with his colleagues, estimated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looked much more complex than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been found in nose and throat masks taken from patients who had recovered and released from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China was encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently being applied might have had an impact.
Initial projections were that Ebola's fever would have affected up to a million people and caused half a million deaths.
But with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually controlled.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be reduced and, over time, it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexist with human beings.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with those of SARS and MERS (figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneezing and, possibly, by direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in the kale, which means that oral-faecal transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases examined may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health-care workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even others in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the face; and surgical masks and retractors of class N95 (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microkabs of liquid from potentially infected people to fly in the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect from inhalation of 10 to 80 nm-size virions, but they only pass 5% of the virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
As particles can even penetrate five surgical masks, combined, medical workers who have direct contact with patients must wear a class N95 mask (Series No. 1860s) rather than a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear a figure-based protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also get into the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, even though he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have been injected into his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health-care workers should also wear transparent face boards or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more often with disinfectant detergents, to try not to leave the home without self-isolation and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about a metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to humanity, its high level of similarity with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be an alarming signal to China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was only after 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Uhan had reassured the citizens, reporting that the new virus had low contagiosticity and limited reproductive status when transmitted from person to person, and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Chinese New Year, and a critical time has been missed when the disease could be held within the city of Uhan with minimal losses.
China & apos; s health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements because each word is citizen-sensitive and can affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information from a clinic rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage of its development rather than to comfort the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly monitor and improve the social response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unstudied coronvirus of a heavy acute respiratory syndrome of type two (SARS-COV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread to China and, at the time of writing, had spread to 50 countries around the world.
As the virus is very similar to the coronvirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 gave rise to a sense of SARS relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant for the control of the epidemic and for the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the rate of hardship and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate for SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even at the unsymptoms of the disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more large than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have a negative normal sample for SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples on the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
In the face of this rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96% homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like volatile mouse coronviruses, we still cannot claim that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was caused by bats.
What kind of animal has become an intermediate species that passed the virus from the original owner, for example, from bats to humans?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission, and the epidemiological situation can be exacerbated at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into respiratory-pathological cells and causing subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it be the cause of the global pandemic, will it also disappear like the SARS or will it be repeated periodically like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
Zonosene origin of human coronviruses
Munition and adaptation have encouraged the development of coronviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including people, over the millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronvirus (HCoV) caused a slight disease, such as a normal cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronvirus can be.
The emergence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to the coronviruses and surprised us with high transmission, but with a lower level of pathogenicity than the SARS-CoV family virus.
The human coronvirus is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonosic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate carriers of some human coronviruses are also known.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of coronvirus-carrying animals can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronvirus in humans.
In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as on their zoonal origin and the means of inter-species transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronviruses in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of coronvirus-related disease found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of delivery and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviridae is a group of single-positive-polar viruses.
These viruses, with the largest virus-containing RNA genome containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, have been named in their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronviruses contain ungenomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genomes contain two large open, partially overlapping reading limits (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in the polyproteins of the rep1a and pp1ab replications.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1 ~ 16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including a chic protein (S), a membrane protein (E), a membrane protein (M) and a nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronvirus lines also encoded a number of lineespeciphic excessory proteins.
Based on the different sequences of protein / coronviruses, four species (alpha, beta, gamma- and deltacoronvirus) are divided, with the species of beta-coronviruses including most human coronviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is a phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronviruses is volatile mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronviruses.
For thousands of years, coronviruses have constantly overcome inter-species barriers, and some have evolved to human-dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronviruses are known.
These include human alpha-coronviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NLD 63.
The other five betacoronviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the Coronvirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Coronvirus of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the Coronvirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome of the second type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light shape, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 have been extremely pathogens, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory disease (PRS) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first thread of the human coronvirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of the separated patients who had a cold in the 1960's.
Since then, extensive research has provided more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronvirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were cut off and the total mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronvirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, was found in 2019 to be the source of the current Coronvirus Infection of 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which, as at 3 March 2020, had claimed more than 3,320 lives and the number of infected persons had exceeded 91,000.
The alarm has been received and the world must prepare for the forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronviruses are of zoonosic origin, and their sources are volatile mice, mice or domestic animals.
The many data sets are in favour of the evolutionary nature of all human coronviruses from volatile mice, to which viruses have been well adapted and in which they do not show pathogenic properties but show a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has given China and the world a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zonosene mechanism of origin of human coronviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors that limit interspecies transport.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for an intermediate and amplifier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review provides an overview of the zonosene origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronviruses have occurred are usually not pathogens for our reserve carriers, but become pathogenic after an interspecies transmission to a new host.
We are also analysing the trend of human coronviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of the separated disease patients, various coronviruses were found in a variety of infected animals, including infetes, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronviruses have been identified.
A brief history of human coronvirus detection in chronological order is presented in table 1.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966; it was later adapted to the reproduction of the WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
HCoV-229E patients had cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general infirmity and throat pain, with high temperature and cough observed in 10-20 per cent of cases.
The HCoV-OC43 virus was later released from the organic culture and then from the serial transshipment into the brain of the moth-suckers in 1967.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other pathogens & apos; respiratory effects, such as those of type A influenza and Rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are common in the world and are generally transmitted in the winter at moderate latitudes.
The main incubation period for these two viruses is less than a week, followed by an estimated two-week disease.
According to the results of a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have developed a normal cold of light.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity have experienced a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the "anemic pneumonia epidemic," was the first well-documented human-induced pandemic in human history, and the SARS-CoV, the third human coronvirus, was the source of the disease.
The first case of SARS was found at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread in many countries and across continents.
Without the inclusion of superactive distributors, it was estimated that each disease could infect approximately two more persons; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days and the peak of the virus was 10 days.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially had muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general blunder and octopus, and later symptoms included abdomen, cough and respiratory failure.
Lymphony, liver malfunctions and high levels of creatinkinase are common laboratory deviations from the SARS standard.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, spuffle of epitelial cells and an increase in the level of macrophags.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of their lungs.
In such difficult cases, other bodies, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The virus was first released from an open biopsy of a patient's lung relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to human coronvirus research.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
It was first found to be primarily affecting young children, older persons and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NLD 63 is characterized by sprinkles, carotitis, high temperature and bronchyolite.
Another independent study described the removal of the same virus from the abrasive material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
It is estimated that HCoV-NLD 63 causes approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases they cause is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to a obstructive laringitis, which is also called a circle.
HCoV-HKU1 was released in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolite.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HCU1, which causes lung-shaped respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All four of these human coronvirus, which causes out-of-hospital infections, have been well adapted to people, and their mutation, which causes high-pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents and their causes were unknown, as in the rare example of the more viral subtype HCoV-NLD 63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of lower respiratory pathways in China.
Typically, when these human coronviruses become less virulent or pathogenic when they are able to be effectively transmitted and preserved in human beings.
The short-term respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a light 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal deficiency.
Most laboratory cases have been confirmed in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there have been cases of import and distribution through occasional secondary cases of infection in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal deficiency, which still distinguishes the MERS from other diseases caused by coronviruses transmitted to human beings.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomit.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of the high-mortality Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) had been recorded, and therefore the MERS-CoV was considered one of the most deadly viruses known to the human being.
From mid-December to the end of 2019, in Uhan, the Chinese province of Hubei, a cluster of patients with pneumonia was identified, which is now being linked to an infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself is called "Coronvirus Infection 19" (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with approximately 3.4 per cent of the deaths.
It should be noted that the death rate in the Khubei province of China is 4.2 per cent and beyond 1.2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS, causes a severe respiratory infection with an increase in temperature, cough and abdomen.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is capable of rapidly transiting into acute respiratory deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotid sequences (82%), these viruses still form different branches of the philo-genetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more capable of transmission than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be unsymptomable, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, the coronviruses transmitted to the human person have a similar incubation period and the duration of the diseases they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four human coronviruses causing non-hospital infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to what is most common in human coronviruses that cause non-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, light symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 also has interesting patterns, both for human coronviruses that cause non-hospital infections and for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronviruses that cause non-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronviruses that cause non-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the glass samples.
We have yet to answer the question whether the fiscal path of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonal SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronviruses that cause non-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including transmissions, pathogenicity and sustainable proliferation after human transition.
All four human coronvirus, which causes out-of-hospital infections with light-form symptoms, have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may have been well adapted to these four human coronviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only human coronvirus survivors of the pandemic in the past.
Human coronviruses, which cause severe diseases in people, and people who cause serious diseases in human coronviruses, have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronviruses must be replicated in the human body to a sufficient extent to result in an accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the control factors of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus is fully adapted to human beings.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among people by means of quarantine or other control measures.
For many years, four out-of-hospital coronvirus have been distributed to the population, causing a normal cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal tank.
The highly pathogenic coronviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted well enough, and their transmission to people cannot be supported.
They need to be preserved and replicated in their zoonic tanks and to search for sensitive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing means.
SARS-CoV-2 has features such as SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four out-of-hospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least now.
But it's more pathogens than out-of-hospital HCoV, and less pathogens than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to the human being and whether it will be distributed in the human environment without a tank or with an intermediate carrying animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and reserve HCoV virus carriers.
The animal is an evolutionary host of HCoV if it transposes the close-born from the same high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The pre-virus is usually well adapted and the non-pathogen is in this body.
Similarly, the tank-carrier has been continuously carrying HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only incorporated into an intermediate medium right before or about the time it was introduced to a person, it was not well adapted to a new medium and often pathogens.
This intermediate medium can serve as an area source of human infection and play a role as an increasing vehicle, allowing the virus to be replicated and then handed over to people, increasing the extent of human infection.
HCoV can carry a dead end infection if it can't withstand a transmission inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate medium becomes a natural reserve.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had contact with hunting and fishing animals (wild) in the anamysis.
Further research into seropravity has shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV virus is higher than the population at large.
The Himalayan cyvets (Paguma larvata) and the enotoxic dog in living animal markets have become the first established carriers of viruses like and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported in the markets following the destruction of all the quotes.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan cyvets living in nature or on farms that had not entered the market, in most cases SARS-CoV had not been determined, so that it could be concluded that the Himalayan cyvets could only serve as an intermediate amplifier and not as a natural SARS-CoV tank.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that many small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifiers.
They all seem to be SARS-CoV's dead end-holders.
The subsequent search for a natural SARS-CoV animal has identified a close-family CoV of volatile mice, which is known as associated with an acypical pneumonia by the coronvirus of the HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), and which is present in the Chinese sub-coniferous volatile mice.
These mice are positive on antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other volatile mouse coronviruses have 88-92% of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that volatile mice have become the carriers of new human pathogens.
In volatile mice, several SARS-like coronviruses (SL-CoV) were also identified, but none of them, except one that denotes WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV is a human angiotenzine-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, which was obtained from a volatile mouse fecal sample, uses ACE2 bats, cytes and humans as a receptor for entry into the cell.
It is interesting that the serum of the healing patients with the SARS could neutralize the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest birth of SARS-CoV in volatile mice, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotid sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and volatile mice are not a direct reserve for SARS-CoV.
The filogenetic analysis is the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bats and the CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 volatile mice and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipepplel dipeppidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are philogenetically closer to those of the beta-coronviruses of the volatile mice found in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homology of the nucleotid sequences of the MERS-CoV and his closest relative, CoV-HKU25, is only 87% of the bats.
So bats may not be a direct reserve for the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-mountain camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, which is identical to the virus found in humans, was separated from the nudity of the same-mountain camels, which further confirms the role of the camels as the true reserve carriers of the MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that there were few symptoms, but a massive virus, of camels who were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have released the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by fec-oral means, which is also the main way to release the virus in volatile mice.
However, questions still remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome did not have contact with the verbs prior to the symptoms and were rightfully attributed to the transfer from a person or to the transmission by unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The "SARS-CoV-2" homology is 96.2% similar to the "CoV RaTG13" bats from the Asian subcones of Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be attributed to them.
So the volatile mice may not be a direct reserve for SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical volatile mouse coronviruses are found in the future.
It is assumed that the direct SARS-CoV-2 animals should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uhan wholesale market of seafood, with many initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates a likely transfer from an animal to an animal.
Several recent studies based on methagenic sequencing have concluded that a group of threatened small mammals, known as Pangolin (Manis javanica), could also carry a parent's beta-coronvirus, a family of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new genomes of the pangolin coronvirus is 85-92% similar to the SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotid sequence level of about 90%.
They are placed in two sublines of virus differentiation, such as SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a binding domain receptor (RSD) more close to SARS-CoV-2 with an identical amino acid sequence of 97.4 per cent.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more disoriented, despite a higher degree of homology of sequences in the entire genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the definition of virus contiges in lung samples that were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual treatment to obtain a sequence of genome, which includes about 86.3% of the full-scale virus genome.
It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the pangolin has become one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, due to the divergence of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronviruses of the pangolin, relatives of SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the concrete-coronviruses of the pangolin associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The economic path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established in volatile mice, pangolins and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronviruses of the pangolin family members of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 are the highest homology of the sequences throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high level of similarity between the pangolin betacoronviruses, relatives of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2, is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal is in favour of a recombination between the pangolin betacoronvirus, the related SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronviruses.
The final decision on the direct zonosene origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not available.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonosic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be coronviruses of volatile mice, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that a volatile mouse coronvirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), found in a North American three-colour connector, showed a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another coronvirus of volatile mice, known as Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that it could be a camel medium.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The filogenetic analysis provided evidence of the interspecies transmission of HCoV in the anamysis.
When the HCOV-OC43 virus was interspecies in about 1890, and people were infected with domestic animals, a respiratory pandemic was recorded.
The history of the HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not so clear.
Alphacoronviruses of volatile mice, close to HCoV-229E, were found.
Between them is the alpha-coronvirus of the Alpak.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpaks, who could have had contact with bat mice in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alpak.
Second, the volatile mice 'alpha-coronviruses, associated with HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogens in volatile mice, while the alpak's alpha-coronvirus has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpak's alpha-coronvirus was not found in wild animals.
It is thus not possible to rule out the possibility that the Alpaks have been given an alpha-coronvirus, the kinship of HCOV-229E, from humans.
In fact, volatile mice are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nippa virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats could be directly transmitted to people by HCoV-229E.
On the other hand, while the volatile mice 'alphacoronviruses could serve as a gene bullet for the HCOV-229E virus, the alpaks and single-mountain camels could become intermediate carriers that pass the viruses on to people, just like the MERS-CoV virus.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of a cross-species transmission from the bats to the same-mountain verbs and from the same-mountain camels to the human.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from the volatile mice is known from its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that volatile mice provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-term years, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make volatile mice "ideal distributors."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced by a one-mountain summit a decade ago.
It has been well adapted to these verbes, which have become a stable and natural reserve from an intermediate medium.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very light disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
His occasional transmission to a person is an accident, and the man remains a dead end-user of the MERS-CoV, as his transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the betacoronvirus of the pangolin is highly pathogenic to the pangolin.
They can be the end-holders of beta-coronviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, as well as the cyvets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans need to be confirmed or excluded.
First, volatile mice can be a reserve for a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share the environmental niche with the bats because of the mining or cutting of these animals.
Second, the pangolins can be one of the intermediate amplifiers that the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently entered.
People are infected with the virus by cutting carcases and eating wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-COV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have taken place in a third form, which had contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also facilitated cross-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of the coronvirus mutations can be considered "moderate-high" with an average rate of about 10-4 changes per year per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronvirus to new owners.
Coronviruses have a corrective exoribonuclasis, the removal of which results in an extremely high rate of mutation and a reduction or even non-viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotid analog Remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronviruses by inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising funds against SARS-CoV-2, which need to be tested in clinical research.
However, the frequency of the coronvirus mutations is almost a million times higher than the number of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, the frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations is likely to be lower, indicating a higher level of human adaptation.
The virus has, presumably, already adapted to another medium close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to one-mountain verbes.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and anti-virus drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, a large RNA genome in coronviruses has led to greater plastic change in genome modifications for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species coevolution favourable to the emergence of new coronviruses under conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open-ended protein reading frameworks and functions encoded in the direction of the 3-end genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronviruses are randomly and often switched during the RNA replication.
During the transmission of DNA, the coronvirus in the body, which serves as a mixing receptacle, is often switched by the thread.
High homologic full-size and subgenical RNA can recombine and create new coronviruses.
Filogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animals of coronviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Transmission-related virus interaction
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor for interspecies transmission.
This article provides a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in the event of interspecies transmission, with a recombination of SARS-CoV.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV and cyvets, it is considered that SARS-CoV is undergoing rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to the mutations on SDS protein S.
In general, the RSD of the Coronvirus protein interacts with the cell receptor, and the response of the carrier's antibody is highly selected.
The SARS-CoV RSD is an amino acid, from the 318th to the 510th, on a piece of S1, which is linked to the angiotending 2 (AF2) of a person, as well as his or her coreceptors, to put the virus into a cell.
The SARS-CoV virus is capable of identifying the receptors of the AFP2 of different animals, including bats, cyvets, mice and enotoxic dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus interspecies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, which are different from human and cyvette virus strains, 4 of which are in a receptor-binding motive for interaction with the AFP2 receptor.
SARS-CoV quotes have a mutation of K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of the chic protein with the human receptor AFP2.
In other words, these two alternatives to amino acid can be particularly important for adapting the virus to human beings.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in segment S1 of the S protein is likely to change the associated S-protein affinity to human AF2.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope shows that the affinity of this link is 10-20 times higher than between AFP2 and S-SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other coreceptors were required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It's amazing that HCoV-NL63 is also in contact with AFF2, but with another segment of the S. protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N amino peptidasis for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsial acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the interspecies transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of the dependency and restriction of the host.
The diversion of these proteins between human beings and natural reserve HCoVs, such as bats, single-mountain camels and rodents, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For HCoV to be successful, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and to subdue the factors of the carrier & apos; s cutting.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
An impartial full-gene screening of vehicle dependence and cutting factors for SARS-CoV-2 can produce good results using the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCoV: back to zero
The diversity of the volatile mouse coronviruses is a great opportunity for new HCoV.
In this sense, the volatile mouse coronviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV excessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, as the volatile mouse viruses associated with SARS-CoV have been isolated, but it has been established that they encode the disgenic proteins of ORF8.
In the strains that were isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotid division, specific to the coronviruses of SARS-CoV, was found.
This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha-and gammacoronviruses, where RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase identified a large number of smaller recombinant sites.
The recombination was also identified in the unstructural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to repeated events between different lines, which occurred in single-mountain camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCOV where HCOV recombined with other animal coronviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can lead to unintended changes in virus genomes, most likely as a result of the virus & apos; s removal from selective pressures, such as from the carrier & apos; s immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E, due to a two-nuclotid defoliation.
While an intacit open-readable ORF4 can be seen in the volatile mouse and camel viruses of HCOV-229E, the alpaca alpha-coronvirus shows a single-nucleotitic box, which leads to a change in the scope.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also due to the sampling pressure on their reserve carriers.
In the case of volatile mice, the coronviruses reported weak or non-existent symptoms, indicating a mutual adaptation between the coronviruses and the volatile mice.
It turns out that volatile mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronviruses.
For example, the inactivity of the inflammatory response in volatile mice effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in volatile mice has been suppressed by the April inhibition receptor of NKG2 / CD94 natural cell killers and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class I hypocompatibility complex.
Moreover, a high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of volatile mice, can suppress the repetition of the coronvirus, while also influencing the exoribonuclease reading, thus creating a sampling pressure to generate the strain of the virus, which is highly pathogenic when entering the new host.
More pathogenic coronvirus strains can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is no accident that three new human coronvirus have emerged over the past 20 years.
Coronviruses are non-pathogenic or cause slight symptoms in their reserve carriers, such as bats or camels.
They're very much replicating without causing a strong immune response from the host.
That is the secret to why we see no-symptomless agents, and what causes serious human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly related to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, where the more immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in the case of the unsymptomable agents, the immune response does not involve the replication of the coronvirus.
The same immune response strategy can have positive effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon answer.
Thus, the adoption of type I interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-COV-2 infection should have a positive effect.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3-inflammasoma has been disrupted by volatile mice.
Based on this, the inhibition of the NLRP3-inflammasoma with MCC950 may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a volatile mouse concrete virus, 95% of which is a nucleotid homology, is also found with SARS-CoV, there is also a volatile mouse coronvirus, 96% of which is a nucleotid homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that cyvets and other animals on the market carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate vehicles for SARS-CoV-2 were installed.
The pangolin betacoronviruses, an astonishing homologic SARS-CoV-2, were found, indicating that the pangolins could be an intermediate medium, or that the fragments of the pangolin betacoronviruses could have entered the final version of the SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by human beings.
Coronviruses have received universal attention because of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronviruses in volatile mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zonosene and HCoV in human transmission.
The evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from bats and were handed over to the person through intermediate means.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from human-to-market contact, the closure of the wild markets and the destruction of the slate on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various lines of concrete-coronviruses of pangolin, close to SARS-COV-2, the pangolin should be removed to prevent the zonal transmission of the infection from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to people through pangolin and other mammals, and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single-mountain camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the verbs for the control of the MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
As we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks of disease.
In the world, there are a variety of zonotic coronviruses.
In particular, the coronviruses of volatile mice with zonosene potential are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonic coronviruses, which will lead to new coronviruses in the future, which are easier to transfer and (or) more deadly to human beings.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary human-animal contacts, a culture of wildlife consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After the hard tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations are required.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural tanks until new territories can be seized.
While many of the properties of volatile mice are conducive to the spread of viruses, it is possible to minimize the likelihood of human contact with volatile mice and other species of wild animals if people are to be taught to stay away from them.
A better understanding of the environment of coronviruses and their natural resources requires continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zonosis is to keep people away from the environmental niches of natural zoonic viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the zonosene puzzle of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if the bats have passed on the SARS-COV-2 pre-virus to the pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the bats and pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Second, if volatile mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have made contact with volatile mice.
Third, if the role of a true intermediate medium is a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including human beings, bats and pangolin.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be determined from their natural resources.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspected disease" and "confirmed" COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronvirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides a clear recommendation to combat the pandemic around the world.
However, the coronvirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and set out the latest diagnostic criteria for "cases of suspected illness" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the "Recommendations on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19" (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC.
In December 2019, the new coronvirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now known as the coronvirus 2019 (COVID-19), was launched, and the virus itself was called "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-COV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on the Military Medical Research website on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
We note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the "Recommendations on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19" published by the National Health Committee (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /) were issued, with some of its provisions having changed significantly.
Recently, the work prepared by Zhou with the co-authors has provided comments on our recommendations, and they have made simple proposals for diagnostics based on the clinical experience already available.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on the global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the "Recommendations on Diagnostic and Therapy for COVID-19" (the trial seventh version) and the results of ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (dated 3 March 2020), a single element of epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis on a case of suspicion:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or location in and around Uhan or other locations where cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days before symptoms were present; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with high-temperature patients or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or from other human settlements where cases of COVID-19 were recorded during the last 14 days of contact with high-temperature or high-level (2) events; and (2) school-level or high-level (2).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) external infections of COVID-19; (3) total leukocytes are normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of a disease should be based on the suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogenic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows a high homogenicity of relatively new coronviruses; (3) the positive results of the serotest for the specific anti-bodies of IgM and IGG; or a change in the result of a negative test for a specific SARS-CoV-IV-2 or an increase of a relative to a higher phase of 4.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) issues of the document, a real-time NCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was added.
The pathogenic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and then in the seventh issue, the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal set for the detection of nucleic acid in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which will increase the availability of different samples and facilitate the inclusion of positive results of tests for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is growing evidence of the need for care in the treatment of patients with an abnormally symptom and without symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al., should be updated as it classifies those who do not have clinical symptoms as a "low risk" group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "cases of suspicion of illness" and "confirmed cases," we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner with a view to providing effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, a daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 a day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDOR) reported that 114 cases of reported infection, as well as 33 patients who had recovered, were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, said that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deaths were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the victims was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Maetri Hospital.
On Saturday, on an online video statement, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obeidul Kwader, stated that public transport would be terminated for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - has still been authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March with two persons who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As at 19 March, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 has crossed a million-dollar line of infections around the world.
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronvirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide was over 1 million.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COVID-19 coronvirus.
The first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of death from the coronvirus was reported in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had no cases of coronvirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10: 00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronvirus were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths due to coronvirus were recorded on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced increased measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobanin, extended the self-isolation regime for the citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite their self-isolation, would be paid up to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of a 15-day extension of the state of emergency; the result: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the curfew lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m..
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewayn, announced that the state's self-isolation regime had been extended by order until 1 May.
Marines in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian networks of Woolworths and Coles have reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased once in all of the country & apos; s stores to two and one package respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported on the public statements and on the Facebook page.
It is reported that citizens have started to make emergency stocks because of the fear that COVID-19 may lead to a regime of general self-isolation.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this amount to four packages.
The Coles trade network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that, with the introduction of a four-package limit, "in many stores, toilet paper is still being purchased too quickly, one delivery within an hour," and called this demand "unprecedented," while the ALDI, in a Facebook post published on Tuesday, referred to this trend as "unexpected."
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that amount to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles began to order larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of supplies, Woolworth ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale on the media.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rieiler Association, reported that the rivals were trying to replenish the stock, but this was difficult due to restrictions on the road schedule on the local authorities.
It expected an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers were trying to meet demand, but less and less profitable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to the depletion of the stock, some shops were unable to take stock on the media.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the University of Queensland Technology, said that the stores were resupply every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky product, so that the number of storage stocks was small and, after the sale of the total volume of the goods, long series of stripes remained empty, increasing the feeling of stock shortages.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand-disinfecting devices could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, the buyers might not be so panicked," said Russell Zimmerman.
In the past Wednesday, the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberley-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent, reported that they were working 24 hours a day to ensure a sufficient number of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne had been reduced due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labour Day, some real estate sellers had started offering free toilet paper to the first participants in the auction.
The fourth edition of the daily NT News, published in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of March 3, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including medical masks, hand-disinfectant, gallant, hand-washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday night, it was observed that the online store of the British Ocado supermarket also limited the sale of the Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of a COVID-19 infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronvirus.
Although the term "pandemic" only describes the extent of the disease and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
"All countries, together, are still able to influence the progress of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries are involved in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation, monitoring and mobilization of their citizens, "the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, explained.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Freden, former Director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said in his interview on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has yet been monitored from its inception until its continued global spread."
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronvirus.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before. "
In January, WHO first declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international importance and then granted it a new status, a pandemic.
The Director of the United States National Institute of Alergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said that the outbreak was "It's just the beginning, it's gonna be worse."
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the world on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The 2013-2020 Coronvirus is a current Coronvirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was found in Uhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an emergency of international importance was declared in the area of public health, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in the death of some 97,000 people.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
China has a mortality rate of 4 per cent, while the global mortality rate varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory difficulties.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory stress disorder.
The time from the first symptom to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the recommended preventive measures include hand washing, cashle cover, a distance between people, and the identification and self-isolation of persons suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as widespread shortages of goods, compounded by panic.
Schools and universities have been closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world & apos; s students.
Disinformation on the virus has begun to be disseminated on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens or people who resemble them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced as a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Uhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported that there had been pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation was initiated in early January 2020.
Incidents were mainly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be of zoonosic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus that is very similar to the bats of the bats, the coronviruses of the pangolin and the SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the South-China section of the "Morning Post" newspaper, which was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had declined but had begun to increase unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the many cases of low-level symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the United Kingdom & apos; s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of human contamination that were tested at COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official records.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy not to test for only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China until 23 January and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was much higher than the number of reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this could be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are well-recovered.
In other more complex cases, the time from the beginning of the symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, and the most frequent period was 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, some 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent of those killed had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes; official mortality data from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on deaths of patients with positive results of the COVID test carried out under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account those who have not been tested - for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official figures for COVID.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) press secretary recognizes: "We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than the actual." His words are supported by reports of some single cases in the United States, which are often recorded with incomplete data in pandemics such as the H1N1 Wine Influenza epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death was recorded in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents other than Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and general health status; the mortality / morbidity rate is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during the given time interval.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039 / 1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-morbidity ratio has decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those who have symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who have symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of deaths due to disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of patients who are infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain population groups from the time of infection to the completion of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
The Centre for Proof Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the mortality rate from the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The top figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary test at COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on the CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash are not identifiable and may vary from location to location.
Mathieu Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to come to the plateau, and then when the number of available patients ends, they start to fall.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen. "
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Joon Nanshan, claims that "everything can end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "would circulate, possibly for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine is established (possibly 18 months or more)," physical dislocation and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, thinks, "I don't think this coronvirus will ever disappear for ever, because it's so easy to transfer," and that it "can become a seasonal disease by outbreak every year."
The virtues of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively unspecific, and some infected people can carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are high temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the formation of wet in the respiratory tract (slime), loss of smell, abdomen, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, octopus, vomit, haemorrhage, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, constant pain or a sense of breast depression, sudden sensation of mind, difficulty of awakening and abrasion of a person or a lip, and if there are such symptoms, they should immediately seek medical care; further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory stress disorder, sepsis, septic shock and death.
In some infected persons, the disease may be unsymptomable, without any clinical evidence, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of the infection, and the doctors therefore recommend that persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis has been confirmed be placed under strict control and testing for infection.
According to estimates by Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptoms varies from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; so far it is not clear on the symptom loss of the smell: the initial estimates for the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom were initially 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, open cough drops can be spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for a longer period of time, and that the response drops can also be formed by the exhale, including during the conversation, although the virus is not usually carried by the air.
The couplings can be found in the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary resuscitation (VR), can cause the spraying of inhalation products and, therefore, the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also enter the body if the person is concerned with the contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by contact with his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infected within the first three days of the symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the symptoms and at later stages of the disease.
There were cases where the tests were positive in testing three days before the symptoms were present, which suggests that the virus could be transmitted before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed non-symptoms, but contact monitoring studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission of the disease from non-symptoms.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spreading, but it is known that one disease usually infects two or three others, and that the virus is able to survive on the surface for hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus was able to live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day and on the copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with positive results from the COVID-19 in the household and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities advise that their hands be washed after contact with animals, just like, for example, after contact with other surfaces that the infected people may have touched.
The heavy acute respiratory coronvirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first found in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in the coronviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by a domestic soap that dissolves its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 has a great similarity with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is assumed that it is of zoonosene origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronvirus has shown that it is genetically clamped with the birth of Betacoronavirus, a subset of Sarbecovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of volatile mice.
At the full genome level, it is 96% identical to other BatCov RaTG13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin and human viruses.
The whole-genome comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarity (92%) is between the pangolin coronvirus and SARS-COV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate owners of the virus.
The virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although it should eventually be confirmed by a polymersis chain response analysis with a back-transcription (RT-PCR) of an infected secret or computer scan.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and current disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method for COVID-19."
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymersis chain reaction test (RT-PCR) is carried out.
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to several days.
The test is usually used for a nosebleeds, although a robe may also be used, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to identify antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to obtain approval for widespread application.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the visualization of the symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) are asymmetric periphery by type of mesh glass and the absence of pleoral pods.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for the development of an international database for the detection of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, the identification of COVID-19 has limited clinical characteristics.
In China, a major study was carried out to compare the results of the breast cell CT and the PCR testing, and it was found that, while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be expanded faster; they were also more sensitive and, therefore, could be considered as a screening tool in the contaminated areas.
Creative neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to diagnose the virus with X-ray and computer tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using napkins for cough or sneezing, which should be released immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that they be physically separated from people; many Governments recommend that they refrain from any short-term travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and limit the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed to a population whose members do not know where and how they have been infected, and that health workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and in the protection of the eyes, and that the monitoring of contact is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and to prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this type of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on developing solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data - for example, recording the user & apos; s proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he is notified, and there are also baseless options on how to prevent infection - for example, a nose and mouth that is not actually effective.
At present, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, and before food, after grinding, cough or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is being destroyed by the domestic soap that opens its protective cover.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectant devices to treat hands on a alcohol-based basis with a alcohol content of at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (a minute after application on the surface of stainless steel) with 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% poodone.
Other components, such as benzalconic chloride and chlorhexide gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as an office or a day-care facility, all such spaces, including offices, toilets, public premises, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensory screens, keyboards, remote control and ATM, used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that, when coughing or sneezing, the mouth and nose be covered by a elbow or napkin and that the used hygiene items be released immediately.
It is recommended that those who may have been infected use medical masks, since the use of a mask may limit the volume and range of excursion products that are dispersed in the air during talking, sneezing and cough.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virulologist from the University of Leeds, "the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and the touch on their faces by dirty hands is the main means of infection." Masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask does reduce the number of contact.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centres, USA, recommend wearing non-medical tissue face masks: China has separately stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended that a medical mask be carried in public transport or public places.
Thailand & apos; s health officials call on people to make and wash face tissue masks at home on a daily basis.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has required all visitors to the food shops to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks have been produced per day since mid-March, the use of medical masks was ordered for all passengers in trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask on their way to the street; those who were unable to purchase masks had been advised to clean them on their own in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social dislocation (also known as physical dislocation) is a measure to combat infection, aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and trade centres.
People can use social dislocation measures while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding human places, using uncontrollable greetings and physically disconnecting themselves from others.
Many Governments in the regions that are particularly affected by the outbreak are currently prescribing or recommending social dislocation.
The maximum number of people who can be gathered in one place, as recommended by the US Government and health-care organizations, has been rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19) to 50, and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited groups of more than two persons from being assembled; older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system were at increased risk of being infected with the virus in a serious form; the CDC recommended that they remain at home as long as possible if there was an outbreak in the region; and in late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities had begun to replace the use of the term "social disorientation" with "physical dislocation," thus reducing physical contact in the context of a virtual or physical communication.
The use of the term "social disorientation" was understood to mean that people should be completely excluded, rather than being in contact with others in alternative ways, and some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among others, recommendations have been made for sexual intercourse only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and you are sure that he has no virus and no symptoms.
People diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for self-isolation in the home.
Health-care institutions have issued detailed instructions on appropriate self-isolation, and many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that all people in the affected areas be placed on their own quarantine.
The highest-risk groups were ordered to be severely quarantine.
Persons who may have been in contact with the infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region that has been heavily affected by the epidemic have been recommended to be placed in quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
The strategies for dealing with the outbreak include control, control or mitigation of the disease.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage, with the aim of monitoring and isolating the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The pressure on the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of an infectious disease is aimed at reducing the epidemic's peak, known as the equalization of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical dislocation, such as the closure of schools and the elimination of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface clean-up; and, once the severity of the outbreak has become apparent in China, more decisive action has been taken to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to control the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, a mass screening and localized quarantine system was introduced, as well as a system to alert the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected persons in self-isolation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and fines for the accumulation of excess medical supplies have increased, and the United Kingdom and United States model has shown that there are serious problems with the reduction (slow but not stop) and the suppression (stop of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2 / 3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be a preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating among the population (or as long as the vaccine is not developed, if it is earlier), as otherwise the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has led to social and economic costs.
Anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment do not exist at present, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
The adoption of unprescription drugs for cold, a sufficient amount of liquid and rest can help to ease the symptoms.
Depending on the gravity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous introduction of the liquid and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are also being considered for use for COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and household" can facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO regards capacity-building and health adaptation to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health-care services to assist in the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-urgent procedures where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19, as well as the expansion of intensive treatment opportunities through training of staff and an increase in the number of available AVL and beds.
There are different theories about where the very first case of infection could have occurred - the so-called "zero patient."
The first known case of a new coronvirus infection was probably on 1 December 2019 in the city of Uhan, Hubei, China.
The number of cases of coronvirus in Hubei province has gradually increased during the month.
They were mainly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories is that the virus was injected into the human body by one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of a zoonosic origin. On 26 December, a case of a mass disease of pneumonia of unknown origin was recorded at the Hubei province clinic, with which a doctor from Zhang Tianjin, who reported the case to the Jianghan Centre for Control and Prevention, in Uhan, on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central hospital in Uhan warned their colleagues about a "coronvirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police of responsibility for the dissemination of false rumours, and the doctor, Ai Fen, received a reprimand from his superiors for raising panic.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Uhana Municipal Health Commission published a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The Uhana health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be high enough to initiate an investigation in early January; in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had been infected. As at 26 March, the United States had outlived China and Italy for the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had been killed and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of infection.
As a result of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted freedom of movement and established border controls.
The national response included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay of the house, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in any form of quarantine, more than 50 million were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure increased to 2.6 billion, about one third of the world & apos; s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Uhan on 1 December 2019; another report, whose credibility was not verified, indicated that the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Zhang Zisyan & apos; s doctor was working on a case of a mass pneumonia of an unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Centre in the city of Uhan on 27 December.
The primary genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 showed the existence of a SARS-like coronvirus.
On 31 December, the Uhanya Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification.
WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned the doctors in Uhan of the responsibility for "spreading rumours" for the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transmitted from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Si Jinping, the "People's War."
The events of "the largest quarantine in human history" began to erupt, and on 23 January a health cordon and a ban on entry into and from Uhan was announced, and this measure later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal transport was prohibited in the city.
In many places, Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Juoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
A new hospital, Leishen, was subsequently built and received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other institutions in Uhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the period of the Chinese New Year.
Universities and schools have been closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
In and outside Hubei province, travel restrictions were imposed.
The public transport schedule has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a citizen movement control regime has been introduced, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) have experienced some form of open-air movement restrictions; after the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine had been introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one case of internal transmission had been recorded on mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Prime Minister of China, Lee Ketzian, reported that the prevalence of cases of internal transmission had been largely stopped and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Uhan, were lifted, two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, and no exact time limit for the withdrawal of the order had been mentioned.
Those who wish to come to China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided monetary stimulus packages to companies. On 4 April, a three-minute "minute silence" was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronvirus, which had been announced by the State Council and had coincided with the event of Quinmin, but the central Government had asked citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online, observing the physical dislocation to avoid a reoutbreak of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had been extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, which had occurred largely because of the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji.
Shinchonji's followers came to Tegu from Uhanya, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 (about 13 per cent) had reported symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, South Korea had the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and it has increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantine after three soldiers were confirmed to have the virus.
The surge had an impact on the number of trips, and therefore the flight schedule of the airlines had been changed; South Korea had launched a programme to screen the population for the virus, monitor contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons, which was considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening techniques included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application by all those coming from abroad, head testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the following day, and increased testing capacity, which allowed for the daily testing of up to 20,000 people.
South Korea & apos; s programme is seen as a success in the fight against the outbreak of the disease, even though it has not been able to isolate entire cities; initially, South Korean society was divided by President Moon Jae In & apos; s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government & apos; s inadequate response to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases per day for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April, 121 countries requested assistance in testing for the virus in South Korea.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later the same day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sports activities, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans to limit long-distance travel were announced, but intensive inter-city movement continued in advance of the Persian New Year.
The Shia shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020, when Iran became the centre of the virus after China in February.
In the light of the allegations that the outbreak had been hidden in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, which indicated that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members reported positive results on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called for the unconditional release of human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and for the temporary release of all prisoners in this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed facilities, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronvirus had been reported every hour in Iran and one new death from the coronvirus every 10 minutes.
According to the representative of WHO, the rate of morbidity in Iran could be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran can affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had called for the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italy when two Chinese tourists had a positive impact on the SARS-COV-2 tests in Rome.
The number of cases has increased rapidly, which has led the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of cases of COVID-19 was later found. The whole began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, under which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed on quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be closed.
On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as there were 100 deaths in Italy at that time.
All major sports events, including the A-series football games, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but all sports events were postponed for at least one month on 9 March.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Therapy (SIARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics with regard to the procedures for prioritizing patients, which may have to be used.
On 19 March, Italy outlived China by the rate of death from the coronvirus, ranked first in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronvirus, 15,887 cases of death and 21,815 cases of recovery in Italy, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report noted that a combination of two factors could contribute to this high mortality rate in Italy: a large number of older citizens of that country and a lack of capacity to examine all those currently suffering from coronvirus.
The United Kingdom has responded to the virus in the most calm of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not require citizens to respect any form of social dissent or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the lack of rapid and serious response to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts that were not of primary importance should be avoided, offering people, where possible, to work from home and to avoid public places such as paves, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pub and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised working citizens up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than Pound2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social dislocation measures, prohibiting more than two people from meeting and limiting travel and active rest in the fresh air only to cases of extreme need.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the disbandment of people.
Most of the enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of those that provide "life-saving" services, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, gas stations and garage.

On January 28, 2020, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, a leading United States government public health organization, announced that it had developed its own test set.
However, testing of the population in the United States was not immediately initiated and, as a result, the true scale of the outbreak was hidden during that period.
The test was hampered by the marriage of the test sets issued by the Federal Government in February, the lack of federal government authorization to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, and the restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done on the appointment of a medical practitioner).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February, less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.
On 22 March, Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, were waiting to be tested for hours or days." Following a report from Washington on 29 February on the first case of a Coronvirus in the United States, Governor J. Insley declared a state of emergency, which was soon announced by other states.
On 3 March, schools in Seattle were abolished and, by mid-March, schools were closed throughout the country. On 6 March 2020, a group of Imperial College epidemiologists in London informed the United States of the projected impact of the new coronvirus on the country.

On the same day, a hospital vessel USNS Comfort per 1,000 beds was set up at the port of New York.
On April 3, 884 deaths from the coronvirus were recorded in the United States for 24 hours.
In New York, as at 3 April, the number of cases had increased to over 100,000, and the White House had been criticized for underestimating the threat and censored information that was being made available to the public through the Office of Vice-President Mike Pence, public statements and publications of health officials and scientists related to the virus.
In general, the views of President Trump's supporters on how successful he was in dealing with the crisis were divided.
Some officials and observers criticized the US's dependence on imports of critical materials, including essential items from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel schemes, which was used to map and predict the spread of the disease.
On the basis of information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travellers from Uhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was identified as the least ready for the outbreak, while Australian cities were considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its New Coronvirus Emergency Plan (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communications in the threat situation.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.

On 5 February, Bill and Melinda Gates pledged $100 million to WHO to finance vaccine development and the treatment of the coronvirus, as well as to protect the population of "at-risk groups in Africa and South Asia" from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on 6 February, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Uhan.
On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was about to send a $2.26 million aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Uhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia over 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia announced 18 million medical gloves, Germany provided various medical supplies, including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of drugs, and pledged $100 million to support the affected countries, and after China had stabilized, it also sent assistance to other countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the outbreak of the coronvirus.
The businessman, Jack Ma, sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to be distributed by the organization to its States parties.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 AVL machines to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada; the Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey expressed concern about medical masks and test kits for Chinese production.
For example, Spain had withdrawn 58,000 Chinese coronvirus test kits, which provided accuracy of only 30 per cent, and the Netherlands had withdrawn 600,000 Chinese betrothed medical masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unsuitable medical masks: they were intended to be manufactured in China but subsequently found to be from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and to control the spread of the infection.
WHO noted a clear difference between the situation of the outbreak of abnormally pneumonia in 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of being classified, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the disease on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government "provided regular updates on the situation in order to avoid panic on the eve of China's New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban movement in Uhan, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that, although "this measure was clearly not recommended by WHO," it also "is a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most widespread location," and called it "unprecedented in public health history." On 30 January, after the ability of human-to-human-to-human-to-person transmission from China and the increase in the number of infections in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared a public health emergency of international importance (PHEIC); this situation was the sixth time of the pandemic in 2009.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan, said that the declaration of PHEIC was "a risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that are too difficult to prevent international movement and trade," and that "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million for strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that "do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries."
Mr. Tedros also stated that "the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest," and called on the international community "to make a choice: to invest today or to pay in the future." At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire United Nations system to respond to the problem."
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will "focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak of the disease more socially and economically."
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint ad hoc team that provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and to assess the "seriousness of the disease and its incidence," organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess "the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronvirus pandemic, noting that" it is too early to call the pandemic but that countries should be ready for it. "
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the global prevalence of the coronvirus would be increased from "high" to "very high" - the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: "It is a test of every government on the planet on a real state of affairs: the time has come to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready, "and also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the" worst scenario. "
Ryan also stated that current data did not give rise to the declaration of the global pandemic as public health officials, and added that the declaration of the pandemic would mean that "we actually recognize the fact that every person on the planet would be at risk of being infected with the virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronvirus a pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was "deeply concerned about both the alarming high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in this regard." WHO was seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the late announcement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the negative situation, Mr. Tedros Adanom, Director-General of WHO, had been requested to resign, which 733,000 had signed as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the human rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone was entitled to life-saving measures against him, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way be a justification for discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone had the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other undefined groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The digital node provides information on national policy measures (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronvirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the British Cabinet, Michael Gowa, and Eduardo Bolsonar, son of President Jair Bolsonar of Brazil, for the action taken to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have shown dissatisfaction with the political response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronvirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Ljiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronvirus had begun in Uhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had emerged in the United States or Italy.
The US President's administration, Donald Trump, called the coronvirus "Chinese virus" or "Uhana virus," saying that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic," a statement that has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and "detract from the inability of the US President's administration to control the spread of the disease."
The Daily Coast has access to the US government telegram, which contains a communications strategic plot, apparently designed by the National Security Council, and there are such references to the strategy: "It's all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television shows. "Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to assist countries affected by the virus are part of the" advocacy force "to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy office, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of "a geopolitical component that includes the fight for influence through the piara and so-called generosity policy."
Borrell also stated that "China is actively advancing the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the US."
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports of aid being sent to the last two countries.
The donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was prohibited by United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid for other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy, also had disputes about medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IWL vehicles for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronvirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that "only China has responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity. "
On 22 March, following a telephone call with the Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the transfer to Italy of Russian military nurses, specialized disinfective transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source," claiming that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was "useless or little useful for Italy."
The source accused Russia of seeking a favourable impression on the world's public at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
President Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected the media attacks and expressed their appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for Kremlin Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that, when United States manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO Defense 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries - the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the cold war - will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized Defender 2020 (Protector 2020): "In the current public health crisis, these exercises threaten not only the United States military and many European countries, but also the people of the countries where such activities are to be carried out." The Government of Iran has been severely affected by the virus, and about two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as 15 other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, Iran & apos; s President, Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, requested the assistance of world leaders, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran, and that the epidemic had led to calls on the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single system of health care for children, family leave and increased public health funding.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had led to a deterioration in diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen who came from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-designated places.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the President or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the Government & apos; s inadequate response to the outbreak of disease; the pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to give Prime Minister Victor Orban the permanent right to rule through decrees, to suspend the work of Parliament, and to hold elections and punish those who would be accused of disseminating false information on the virus and on government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronvirus was described as the cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to control the epidemic, the purchase of goods in a panic environment and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The United States Office of Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings of a lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and vendor failures.
There have also been panic purchases in several locations; this has led to the loss of essential goods from the shops, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn has led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for individual protection has increased 100 times.
This leap has led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as a delay in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It had also caused a lack of individual protection worldwide, and WHO had warned that health-care workers would therefore be hit.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, diigou buyers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and were subsequently banned by the Australian Government; despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illicit trade of critical products, which have been successful, have avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production was small, had not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices could increase.
The food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure that the population was fully fed.
Similar laws require food producers to maintain food stocks in case of emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy had affected China: according to media data of 16 March, China & apos; s economy had been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 because of measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, which had reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Mother China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, a virus outbreak is considered a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agate Demaray, a Economist Intelligence Unit, is projected to remain volatile in the markets until a better understanding of the potential results is available.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed the effects of the Acute pneumonia epidemic of 2002-2004.
According to one assessment made by an expert from the University of Washington, St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take "urgent measures" following a sharp fall in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of the coronvirus, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S & P 500 index and the Dow-Jones index for shares of industrial companies, showed the most dramatic decline since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10 per cent drop.
On February 28, the Sscope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative projection.
The shares fell again because of concerns about the spread of the coronvirus, and the largest fall was on March 16.
Many believe that there is a potential for economic recession.
The economist, Mohamed El-Erian, commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks are responding faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist destinations, and the recommendations of Governments not to make any travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe has ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise-line industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
A number of activities involving a large number of people have been cancelled by national and regional Governments, including the annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year & apos; s events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass accumulation; for example, in Beijing, the prohibited city had been closed and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year & apos; s Leave until 10 February, directing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country & apos; s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools before March and abolishing the New Year & apos; s celebration, with the retail sector suffering globally: the hours of the shops have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Retail-point visits in Europe and Latin America have been reduced by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50-60 per cent.
As a result, in March, there was a 33-43 per cent drop in the number of visits to trade centres compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of equipment to check the temperature of visitors and the cancellation of activities; according to the assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would be the case in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the Uhan epidemic, China lost about 5 million jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were found at home in their provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought assistance from the Government.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis, the outbreak of the coronvirus in the United States could cause 47 million people to be unemployed and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The self-exclusion measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who were paid daily; a study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute had shown that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost their jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, and almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized part-time work.
A German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by a pandemic that has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and art organizations have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public and, where possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concerts and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely around the world, or access to them had been limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or postponed.
In return, an active effort has been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and another recent and growing effect of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
In the film industry, there have also been setbacks, and the Vatican has announced the cancellation of the activities of the Good Week in Rome, which are being held in the last week of the Christian repented period, the Great Post.
Many deparities encourage older Christians to stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders offer to perform public service.
The Roman-Catholic jefargia of Rome has closed down the church, chapel and area of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims are no longer present, and later other religious organizations have also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourdards.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak of the coronvirus and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited access by foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sports activities were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the Prime League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the coronvirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "postponed beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021." The casino and other gambling facilities around the world had been closed and the poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, had also been either postponed or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players being online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also been affected, as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing live online concerts or web festivals, which help people in the creative profession to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
Many Internet memes on the coronvirus have emerged on the network, many of which are humorous and reduce the anxiety of periods of uncertainty.
Since the inception of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against members of the European, United States and other countries.
There have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February reports (where most of the infections were still limited to China) recorded racist attitudes expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received just punishment for anything.
Some countries in Africa are also experiencing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many of the inhabitants of Uhanya and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported both online and offline.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, particularly Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia, and citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed an early petition, insisting on the prohibition of Chinese nationals from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan (# Chinese
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asian residents in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report an increasing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronvirus "Chinese virus"; critics consider this view to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, the protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals who had been evacuated from Uhan to New Sanjar.
Students from North-East India, bordering China, who are studying in major cities in India, reported cases of coronvirus-related harassment.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God avenged them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called them "misconceptions," and in China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese citizens have once again erupted as a result of the pandemic: foreigners have been called "foreign debris" and objects to be "disposed of."
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronvirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronvirus publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on the prizes & apos; servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronvirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies that are injected in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the C-PCR, which recognizes the coronvirus RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm a sufficiently recent or active infection.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and popular control.
The antibody tests identify the number of people who have been affected, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated at the hospital or not at all.
The exact level of mortality from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries was very controversial.
Such differences in data may have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be significantly exaggerated.
With a polymeric chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on samples from respiratory pathways produced by various means, including a nipple or a wet sample.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
The C-PCR test, carried out on the masked from the throat, is valid only for the first week of the disease.
The virus could later disappear from the throat, but still continue to reproduce in the lungs.
Infectious patients tested in the second week of the disease may, as an alternative, take material from the lower respiratory tract using a sucking catheter or use the wrapper (wet) products.
An early PCR test was developed at the Charit clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeric chain response with real-time back transcription (rRT-PCR) and based on 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR of the clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the "E" gene common to all beta coronviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group has been one of the first companies to be authorized by the National Drug Administration of China to use the SARS-CoV-2 emergency detection kit on the basis of the PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have distributed through the International Reagent Resource Manual for real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-PCV-PCV).
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to deformed reagents and a narrow test area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The two-component tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were public and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Office of Food and Drug Quality Supervision as part of an emergency use permit, and US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 on the basis of the RT-PCR throughout the country.
Quest Diagnotics started testing for COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been stated; the sampling and processing of the tests must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virosology and Biotechnology "WECTOR."
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service, and it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo clinic had developed a test to detect the COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnotics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be carried out for 3.5 hours on a large scale of samples, allowing one car to process approximately 4,128 tests for 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for the use (EUA) of Abbott laboratories for the Abbott m2000 test; previously, the FDA issued a permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses a technology for the amplification of insulating nucleic acid instead of PCR.
As this test does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the method can only be positive in five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, and a single-clone antibody test is being developed in Taiwan, which is specifically linked to the new coronvirus's nucleocaptic (N-protein) protein, and it is hoped that results can be obtained in 15 to 20 minutes, like an express influenza test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concludes that "the chest X-rays have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may be of such value even before symptoms occur."
Typical features identified by the CT include two-way, multi-pleural, subpleural, type-of-carbonate-glass, peripheral, asymmetric and aposterical-distribution.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of a brown bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Uhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use the CT for screening or as a first-line test method for COVID-19." As of March 2020, it is the PCR method that is recommended for the initial CDC screening.
The partial immune response to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IGG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the seventh day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct popular control.
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
In the case of PoCT, one blood sample is usually produced by skin cover puncture.
In contrast to the PCR methods, the blood-taking phase is not required for testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to extend their tests to antibodies.
As of April 7, 2020, only one emergency use test was approved by the FDA. Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnotics and Epitope Diagnotics received European permits for their test sets, which can be found in the blood samples of the IgG and IGA antibody, which are capable of combating the virus.
The test capacity is several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the virus RNA.
In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it had acquired were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of the virus to remain at home: "Emergency officers pass a sample test," the patient spins on it, gives it back and after a certain time receives the results of the test. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases in the home, which eliminates the risk of the patient being infected by other visitors at the clinic, or the need to disinfect an ambulance if it was used for the patient's transport.
The rapid-testing centres have helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in a country than in another. On 2 March, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that they were ready to conduct some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient conditions, and that they could only do 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany & apos; s total test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, a rapid test was proposed in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not known, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study found that, as of the calendar week 12 / 2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been carried out on SARS-COV-2, up to and including 12 / 2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) had been positive. The Israeli technology and Rambam Hospital had developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if a combined sample showed a positive result. A temporary laboratory had been opened by BGI in Uhan on 5 February 2020 by a temporary laboratory known as "on a daily or more than 10 000 square metres" in the case of an emergency. "
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI, Van Jiang, and completed in just five days; the modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher and, accordingly, quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
The opening of the laboratory in Uhan was immediately followed by the opening of the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shanzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and an open multi-plex Oriami Assays scheme was produced, which can test up to 1,122 patients on COVID19 with only 93 samples, and these balanced structures can work in small laboratories, excluding the need for robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States had become problematic due to the lack and lack of reagents.
As a result, some authors have referred to test-test reports, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the amount of coronvirus testing currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than that of any other country, and most of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to the possibility of rapid testing, together with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (established on the basis of their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory, which was deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of such a large scale in the world to work outside China.
Various test options for different parts of the genetic profile of the coronvirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German option for the production of test kits that are being sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of test sets in the United States; at the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test sets, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts say that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronvirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for more development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing resulting from the rapid spread of the virus, many United States private laboratories that received hundreds of thousands of samples were overloaded and the stocks of oil and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "shortcomings," and for that reason the Government had removed bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private development of the tests; Spain had acquired the test sets from the Chinese firm Schenzhen Bioeathy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but had found that the results of the use of those sets had been inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reasons for the inaccuracy of the results could be the failure of the samples or the misuse of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would remove the sets that produce inaccurate results and replace them with other sets - those of Shenzhen Bioeasy. The 80 per cent of the test sets that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. The 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović proposed to drop them in the Danube, Atez Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, said that the test kits acquired in China had "a high level of error" and the Ministry "did not use them." The United Kingdom had purchased 3.5 million test sets in China, but in early April 2020 it had been declared unsuitable for use.
Carantine measures for those whose tests have had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people with whom such patients have been contacted, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where a person died for the first time from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two testing cycles for the total population of about 3,400 at an interval of about 10 days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases had been placed on quarantine.
The entry into the locality was closed and the measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronvirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries and no extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops, had to be imposed.
Many of the activities there had been cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore had begun to urge residents to remain at home, but the schools, which had ended on 23 March, had opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but their restrictions have been less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were conducted than in the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because they were able to identify more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first 10 negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 WHO test laboratories for validation testing.
Of these 16 monitoring laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next schedule, the "% positive results" column is dependent on a country-specific test policy.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage positive result than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, with other equal conditions.
The hand mouse, also known as "hand hygiene," is a process of hand-cleaning to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
The regular washing of hands with soap at certain "critical points" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fec-oral means.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or a normal cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., a mucous shell) with unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day, after which hands with soap should be washed: before and after defetation, after washing the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before food, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with the help of evil. The World Health Organization recommends that hands be washed:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After the change of diapers or the washing of a child who was in the bathroom.
After a wink, cough, or a sneeze.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The medical health of the hands is related to the health actions related to the medical procedures.
The hand-washing before taking drugs or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand-washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing diseases), as well as of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who cook or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
It is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronvirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious forms of diarrhoea, and reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and also reduces the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by taking advantage of simple habits such as hand-to-hand washing.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand-washing can reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
A 48% reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea can be associated with hand-to-hand washing; the hand-to-hand and-soap is the only effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (PRS), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each house, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of the PRI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which takes the lives of some 1.8 million children per year.
In general, diarrhoea and pneumonia kill almost 3.5 million children every year.
The United Nations Children & apos; s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before food and after a toilet that has become a strong habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention and reduce mortality from diarrhoea by almost half, and death from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
The hands are usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
The arms also prevent the emergence of an impego, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
The small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to skin drying and, consequently, to damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that too frequent hand washing could lead to the teeth and skin shredding - a disease known as eczema or dermatte of the hands, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered as a symptom of the Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical points" during a day when hand-to-hand washing is important to reduce the risk of a fetal-oral transmission of the disease: after discharge (urea, defestation), after washing of the child's buttocks (diaper change), before feeding, before eating and before / or after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, cough or shrivelling, after having touched an animal waste or an animal, after having touched a garbage.
In many countries, hands-to-hand washing is not very common.
A study on hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7 per cent of soap-washing families were generally accepted; a 2014 study had shown that the highest figure, 97 per cent, had been recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the middle of the list, 77 per cent; the lowest had been recorded in China, 23 per cent; there were currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing a habit of using soap in critical situations.
The "Emergency Health Care Programme" implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale effort to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on dehalmintization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily cleaning of teeth with fluorine.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or cleaning materials are added during the washing process.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water is not per se considered an effective means of skin treatment, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are not dissoluble in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the process of purification.
Solid soap, because of repeated use, may also contain bacteria that can reach it when used.
A small number of studies on skin cover of bacteria with a contaminated piece of solid soap indicate that there is little likelihood of such a fall, as bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still claims that "hand-dosed liquid soap is the preferred option for hand washing."
Anti-bacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended anti-septic or disinfective devices has a selective impact on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents, such as triclozane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotics-resistant strains are not selective to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be in line with the advertising.
In addition to the surface-active substance and the means of skin protection, complex compounds may contain acid (acetic, ascorbine, milk) as a pH regulator, as well as anti-microbial active benzoic acid and other dehydration (aloe, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Hot water that is human skin-friendly is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria are multiplying much faster at a body temperature of 37 ° C.
However, for the removal of natural fat, pollution control and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to a common view, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial burden on the hands.
A hand-to-hand disinfectant (sanitary) or a hand-to-hand antiseptic is a hand-to-hand hygiene device that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the use of hand hygiene on a non-water-free basis (also known as disinfectant hand-to-hand, anti-septic, hand-to-hand-disinfection or sanitation) became more popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of sealants such as a carbometer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or a moisturizer such as liquid or foam glycerin, which is suitable for the use of these devices and reduces the effect of the drying of the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases anti-microbial activity; disinfectors containing a minimum of 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Disinfectors kill bacteria on a alcohol basis, including multiple-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, Rhinvirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectors containing 70 per cent alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on their hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99 per cent of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4-5) on their hands 1 minute after use.
Disinfective devices on a alcohol-based basis are practically ineffective against the virus of the norovirus (or Norwalk) type, the most frequent cause of infectious gastroenteritis, and sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-containing means are needed to carefully process and feed the skin on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers over the whole length, shall be raised for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are fully fed.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the hand-washing rather than the use of disinfectant devices be chosen, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increase in the prevalence of such disinfectors is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of hand-disinfective devices on a alcohol basis may cause skin tenderness if the composition does not contain leniency and / or skin-moisture.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigating substances to the instrument.
In clinical tests, hand-disinfectors with softening components caused much less irritation and skin tenderness than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
The allergy contact dermate, the contact rapinus syndrome or the hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectant devices are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of irritating contact dermatics has been a factor in the choice of disinfectant devices compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water-containing means do not clear their hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand-disinfectant devices are not as effective as they are to prevent the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms as conventional soap and water, since, when used, pathogenic micro-organisms are still in their hands.
The effectiveness of a disinfectant for non-alcohol-containing hands depends to a large extent on components and composition, and has historically been much lower than for alcohol or alcohol-containing equipment.
Most recently, it has been proven that preparations using benzalconic chloride have a persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to be losing efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive side-effects.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with evil or clay.
Gold or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash are contaminated by micro-organisms, this may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as when it comes to water, it forms a alkali solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
In order to prevent contamination, the United States Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing, which includes the following steps:
Put your hands under warm or cold flow water.
It is the running water that is recommended, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water is not relevant.
Wash your hands, raising them with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, and the area between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes the microbes from the skin, and research shows that when you use soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Triple your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps to remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you wash your hands, the more the microbes are removed.
Fill your hands under the water.
The use of hand-to-hand flicking in standing water can cause re-contamination.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on your own.
Soft and wet hands are more easily contaminated, most often people leave areas such as thumb, wrist, thumbs and fingernails unaddressed.
Artificial fingernails and used fingernails can contain many micro-organisms.
It is often recommended that a moist lotion be used to prevent the skin from being dried, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the flow water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways of washing hands: water-saving solutions such as foot-pedal crane and other low-cost options exist in areas with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries).
The foot-pedal crust is a simple structure consisting of a vessel suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressured to have water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the process of hand hygiene, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing amount of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on the Production of Paper Pills and Paints, which included a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and more modern hand-dryers.
It was found that after the washing and drying of hands in a warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips on average increased by 194 per cent and on the hands by 254 per cent.
It also found that after the washing and drying of hands in a dryer with air flow, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips is increasing by 42% and on the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips is on average reduced to 76 per cent and on the hands to 77 per cent.
The air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h, 400 miles / h), is capable of blowing the microorganisms off the hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and the sanuzel in a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of warm-air hand dryers is spreading micro-organisms within a radius of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study on the assessment of various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed, depending on the dry-hand method:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand-cleaning with disinfective napkins can be an alternative solution during travel without soap and water.
The hand-disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol on a alcohol basis.
The medical method of hand-washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemmelwis found it to be very effective (in 1846) in the prevention of inpatient diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget it.
According to one study, the use of such devices is indeed helping to reduce infection.
The medical wash of the hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel for each part of the hands.
The hands should be ripple at each other, clinging their fingers.
If there's dirt under the fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
As the microbes may remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after the hand drying, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This avoids the re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic micro-organisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch patients, and thus spread micro-organisms.
According to one study, correct hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the incidence of kateter-related bleeding by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard hand washing and treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The review was carried out by Whitby in co-sponsorship.
If compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure performance and verify hand health.
The World Health Organization refers to "five points" when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
before the use of antiseptic as well as
The addition of anti-septic chemicals to soap during hand washing ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in a high-content environment that is resistant to antibiotics; a "hand-cleaning" before a surgical operation requires a crane that can be switched on and off without touching it; a little chlorhexide or iodine water should also be used to cover the hands, sterile hand-drying towels after washing, a sterile friction brush and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires hands and forearms to be washed up to elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There's no need to lose hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During the breakup, the water from the forearm shall not be brought back to the hands.
After the washing, the hands dry the sterile tissue and wear a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash hands or use a hand-to-hand antiseptic before and after care procedures.
In order to combat stafilococcal infections, hospitals found that the first 20 per cent of the washing of hands was most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits had been achieved when the rate of hand washing had been increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with anti-bacterial soap, hand-washing with conventional soap results in more than three-fold increases in the incidence of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food; the comparison of hand-to-hand spikes with alcohol-containing and hand-washing with anti-bacterial soap, on average for 30 seconds per procedure, has shown that the treatment of hands with alcohol-containing solution has reduced bacterial pollution by 26 per cent compared to anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-held alcohol solutions in terms of reducing the number of influenza A H1N1 and the Chlostridium diffill dispute; activities to develop hand hygiene in health facilities may include hand-washing training for personnel, improved availability of hand-held alcohol solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff about the need to wash hands.
Further research is required on the most effective measures in the various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop a habit of regular hand-washing.
In most rural areas of Africa, for example, there are far from every private or public toilet, although there are cheap ways to wash hands in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
The promotion and encouragement of hand-to-hand washing can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the health situation in countries with lower-middle-income income countries, community-based sanitation and epidemic surveillance is effective, while public marketing campaigns are less effective, one example of the promotion of hand-washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund Three Star Approach approach: it promotes simple economic measures in schools that encourage soap-based hands-washing by students, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-held facilities is one possible measure that is being implemented as part of the information campaigns on hand health with a view to reducing morbidity and child mortality.
World Hand-washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2011-20 Coronvirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emoji that symbolizes hand-washing.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries as compared to DALYs (years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that the promotion of hand-washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other health measures.
The importance of hand-washing for human health - especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two new hand-health innovators: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), the English nurse and the "founder of modern care for the sick."
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by the rotting smell called the myasms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of digestive-related diseases and health-related infections, the United States Centers for Control and Prevention of Diseases have become more active in promoting hand health as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of pig influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, there were posters with "the right hand-washing techniques" in public toilets, as well as in office and airport toilets.
The phrase "wash hands" means a manifestation of its unwillingness to take responsibility for anything or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthea: Pontius Pilat "washed his hands" when deciding on the crucifix of Jesus Christ; the phrase was subsequently more widely used in some English communities.
In the "Macbeth" play, Shakespeare, Lady Mcbeth starts to wash her hands unintentionally in an attempt to clean up an imaginary blur that symbolizes a bad conscience for the crimes she committed herself and forced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who have remembered or observed any unethical act are more likely to wash their hands than others, and they are more important to their handheld.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after being seen will be involved in any other "cleaning" compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In the religions, hand-washing has both a sanitary purpose and a symbolic meaning: the symbolic washing of hands with water but without soap is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha & apos; is, Hinduism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Induism, Judaism and Islam require that their hands be washed after a visit to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, hands-washing before and after every meal is considered necessary.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
Control of production factors in the context of COVID-19 involves the use of occupational safety and health methodologies to control risk and control coronvirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper monitoring of risks in the workplace depends on the place and work, is based on an assessment of the risks, the seriousness of the community epidemic and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The United States Office of Labour Safety and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk have minimal professional contact with the public and with colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand-washing, to encourage workers to stay at home on the grounds of illness, to comply with respiratory labelling, and to conduct daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in public contact, for example in schools, a high-density working environment and some large retailers.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic prevention measures, include high-impact air-filter-based ventilation, protective screens and available personal protection in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and mortuary personnel who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of having been infected with COVID-19 are in the high-risk category, with the risk increasing to a very high level in aerosol-related procedures or in the collection / processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk-control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protection equipment suitable for the task.
A COVID-19 outbreak can have different effects at the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may be changed for both the types of goods for which there is demand and the means of acquiring such goods (e.g., purchase during non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be delays in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19, and a plan for epidemic preparedness and response can be used for protection.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from homes and communities, and the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls required to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise from the epidemic.
The plans for epidemic preparedness and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health problems, to maintain business operations and to minimize the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the seriousness of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk-control tools is a structure that is widely used in occupational safety and health for the grouping of such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective safety and safety equipment is then administrative and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering security means isolating staff from work-related risk areas and does not rely on the employee & apos; s behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures include changes in working policies or procedures that require action by an employee or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protection shall be selected according to the threat to the employee, be of a size (e.g., respiratory devices), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The United States Office of Labour Safety and Industrial Health (OSHA) considers that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and with their counterparts.
The basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to remain at home, compliance with a respiratory label, including hand-closed cough and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, availability of remote or replacement work, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step for the protection of workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with acute respiratory symptoms remain at home until the heat, the absence of high body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of heat-retardants or other symptoms-preventable drugs, and also provide flexibility to the hospital policy, allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensure that staff members are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there are no confirmed data or suspected COVID-19 infections, but there is a potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the community in the area where the business is located or the recent travel of such person to the COVID-19 sites.
These categories include workers with public contact, such as in schools, high-density and some large retailers; the requirement for engineering and safety facilities for such groups and higher-risk groups includes the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens, and the installation of end-of-the-door-to-door-door-to-door lapses; and the requirement for administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups to remain at home; and the need for personal meetings with virtual means of communication, replacement schedules, non-critical travel of workers, including the development of a public-health-to-health-safety-care-to-care-to-service devices, including the-to-to-safety-service-to-safety-service-to-safety-safety-safety-safety-and-care-care-to-service-to-safety-and-safety-safety-safety-safety-and-safety-safety-care-care-to-the-safety-safety-safety-and-safety-the-safety-safety-safety-the-safety-the-and-safety-safety-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-care-the-and-safety-safety-care-care-care-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-and-the-care-the-the-the-and-the-safety-the-safety-and-safety-the-safety-the-safety-the-safety-the-the-the-safety-the-the-the-safety-the-safety-the-the-the-the-the-the-and-safety-the-safety-work-the-the-the-the-the-work-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-@-@-@-@-@-@-and-the-work-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-the-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may be required to wear respiratory devices.
If a person is ill on the plane, measures are required to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers, such as the isolation of a sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, the provision of a mask or the request to such person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin during cough or sneezing.
Secondary crew members shall wear one-off medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller, or when in contact with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or respiratory difficulties.
The used gloves and other non-recurrent items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and disinfected; in the case of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include the postponement of travel in the event of illness, self-isolation and the immediate reporting of a medical centre on the ship when there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends that a short-term closure be carried out for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social dislocation strategies may be introduced, such as the elimination of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events such as physical or glee, cafeteria meals, increased distance between parks, the regulation of the time of arrival and care, the limitation of minor visits, the use of a separate location of health-care facilities for children with symptoms of influenza.
At a high rate of distribution in the local community, in addition to social dislocation strategies, long-term school absenteeism can be considered; for law enforcement officers with daily responsibilities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of having been infected with COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those prescribed by the emergency medical staff, including the use of appropriate personal protection.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their fortresses and equipment before being reused by domestic cleaning aerosols or by resisting, observe standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of the personal protection used, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that some categories of health-care workers and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical officers, support officers, laboratory staff and medical transport personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in their aerosol-related procedures or in the collection / processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 contamination.
The procedures for aerosol formation include sensing, cough, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or the collection of samples by invasive methods.
The high-risk mortuary workers are those working on the bodies of persons with confirmed illness or suspected of having been infected by COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they do an autopsy, they become a very high-risk category; additional engineering and safety equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19, including in aerosol-related procedures.
In some health-care facilities and morgues, a special negative-pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
The samples should be applied to the safety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to a defined waiting area, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protection, OSHA recommends the use of respiratory devices for workers working up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed illness or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as for those conducting aerosol-related procedures.
In the US, approved NIOSH retractors for a person with a N95 filter or a higher class need to be used as part of a comprehensive written programme on respiratory protection, which sets out requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide more effective protection and comfort for a staff member; WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient & apos; s reception point.
WHO recommends that persons collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or transporters without aerosol-related procedures should wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or a protective screen for the person, robe and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-related procedures, the retractor N95 or FFP2 should be replaced by a surgical mask.
Given the lack of individual protection facilities worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized through the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent circuits, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of personal protection only for the specific task, the continued use of the same respiratory device, while working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and the recommendation not to use masks for those without symptoms.

THEMA: [Covid-19] Load facilitation and preparation for the future
Date / time of amendment: 14 March 2020, 00: 24 UTC
Authorizations: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnection of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship among all our colleagues, as reflected in the e-mail, calls and chat, a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, luckily, we are working with amazing people.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of our appreciation for our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure that the sites are functioning, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of the communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and this is more important today than ever before.
At such a time, not only what we do, but how we do it, is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
Given the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together from the coming week.
Adjustment of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of our communication, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and on how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to lift the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, you can do it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff:
In our expectation, it will be necessary to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before subsequent orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work well for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care about your family, buy food or go to a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't follow your working time.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
It's clear and undisputed, but we mention it.
There is no need for a hospital list or a day off: just inform your manager and help the team to review the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, report to Brian from T & C Ops so that T & C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to meet our obligations to our contractors and staff at hourly rates.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we are doing can produce remarkable results, especially in times like this.
It's about self-help again.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we know what to expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.
Some of the work is considered to be substantial.
We must always support such activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all entities to assess current objectives and shift the focus to support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
Delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work "twice as much to catch up" after the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic time limits for the current time being.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with APP?
In order to meet the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the time frame for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budget formulation, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care to the close, with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all those who need or want to work.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, to the representatives and to the teams with relevant information on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco colleagues could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a number of precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used the anti-virus solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as to the reception and elevator hills through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules of care, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in Columbia County (DC) is on the WWork network, which has shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19-related rules.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia was fully moved to a remote job, following instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we also discussed the issue of the rental of a premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, working remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If there is a need for longer sessions, consider the possibility of splitting them into a course of several days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and make available in advance.
On default, use video communications to facilitate communication and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point, a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in a chat room and monitor the list of speakers as well as the person responsible for the recording (or joint inspection).
If necessary, please contact the Technical Support Service by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Willness Reimbursement programme when buying snacks.
Connect to # remots in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work that was distributed.
HR Operations is studying the ergonomics manuals available in the form of vebines to facilitate the effectiveness of the distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grants to cancel mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons," until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such waivers and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of undertaking agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for having to delay or change such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic community conferences.
Universal attitudes in the global community are not only a disappointment at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief because of mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
In terms of prospects, CRT is working on a page on Meta-Wiki, which will provide a community space to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.
This time we will take the opportunity to share more relevant information, to answer your questions and to spend time together by joining each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help everything we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such e-mail and other important information on COVID-19 from the Office of Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, activities, key workflow, information coverage problems or other assistance, contact CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
In case of confidentiality problems, please e-mail Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
On the contrary, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for important work to be done in future weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need the assistance of each and every one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum impact as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other members of the leadership team Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The Anguilla-Transforming Ferment 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the appropriate angiotenzine-transforming enzyme (ACE), reducing the angiotenzine-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Anguilla-transforming enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endotelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptidae domain M2 and C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid manifold.
ACE2 is a single-way type I membrane, and its fermented active domain is on the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The ACE2 non-cell domain is dislocated from the transmmed domain by another enzyme known as the Dedaza, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bleeding and is eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar cells of the light type II, the enterocytes of the thin intestine, the arterial and venous endotelial cells and the cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The biosynthesis of ACE2 is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stryatum, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight of the ACE.
ACE divides the hormone angiotenzine I into the vascular angiotenzine II.
ACE2, in turn, is a leaching of the carboxic concium of the phenilanine from the angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Il-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolytes it into the vasodilatator angiotenzine (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apelin, neurotenzine, dinorphin A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of a neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is present at Hartnup's disease.
As a transmmed protein, ACE2 is the main entry point for some coronviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (a COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, the connection between the S1 spike SARS-CoV and SARS-COV2 and the ACE2 fermentation domain on the cell surface leads to endocitosis and transformation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the upgrading of the S-serine protein of the TMPRS2 carrier, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, and has led some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help to control infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend that standard therapy be continued by APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced for patients who have received APF inhibitors, who have been at higher risk, having pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those for patients with general risk of pneumonia. "
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be an innovation in the treatment of acute lung damage and is likely to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in the powder with acute respiratory deficiency syndrome caused by lipopolysugaride.
The half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours for people, and the start is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with a non-transposition of the classic enin-angiotenzine inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases where the circulation of angiotenzene II is increased. The introduced rhACE2 has been assessed in clinical tests for acute respiratory stress disorder.
COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation of the 2011-20 Coronvirus pandemic, that is, in the identification of persons ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many annexes have been developed or proposed, which are officially supported by the authorities.
A number of contact tracking applications have been developed.
This gave rise to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to systems that are based on the geographical location of application users.
The more lenient options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user & apos; s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate the Bluetooth-based support function into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be placed under the control of the Government, and Northern Macedonia has launched a "StopKorona!" application working on Bluetooth, which helps track contact with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was expected to be registered with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, with similar applications planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TriceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geosonation function to ensure that patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false performance and potential inefficiencies if only a small part of the population is used.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful "coronvirus" applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could propose their Coronvirus-related applications to App Store to include only "official" or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.
The confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronvirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronvirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for public projects:
Monitoring shall be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the dissemination of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of data must be protected and evidence of such security provided;
Digital surveillance should prevent cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection from abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse, should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Granzen) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the problem of ongoing observation, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, web-based tracking is used instead of applications, which makes it impossible to download the application and avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to the original location data also have major potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile tracking and card transactions, and then combined them to create text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but has also made information on the location of the population available, as a result of the significant changes in the information protection legislation that have been made since the outbreak of the MERS in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
The monitoring of contacts that maintain confidentiality is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dated at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups had worked on confidentiality solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user & apos; s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized travel with confidentiality (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identified personal data never leave the device and all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in the collection and use of location data or the crossing of ways to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on studies from "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic," published in March 2020 by another similar project, the SafeTrade platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that is developing confidentiality technologies, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to exchange confidential location and health data with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, a global TCN coalition was established by groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of monitoring and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace reference code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, which they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to keep confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Implementation of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications for monitoring the movement of coronvirus-infected citizens, but with confidentiality of data
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve the problem of permanent observation by first introducing the system through the updating of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
The repositioning of a drug (also known as reprofiling, diversion, task change or therapeutic diversion) is a reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than that originally envisaged in the design.
This is one of the research activities currently being used to develop safe and effective treatment methods for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of the reconvalescent plasma. SARS-COV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are exposed to drugs, each with several ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target protein for SARS-CoV-2 is a papin-like prosthetic, RNA-dependent RNA-polymeras, helicaze, protein S and ADF-ribophosphate.
Hussein AA and the co-authors, in their pre-clinical study, examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity with the most similar approved drugs, in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorochine and its associated hydroxychlorochine would be among the four drugs investigated under the "Solidarity" clinical test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the tests for chlorochine and hydroxychlorohin would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorochine and chlorochine phosphate in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and was allowed under the EU only as a pilot emergency treatment for patients who were hospitalized but could not receive treatment under the clinical test schemes.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxichlorochine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
The doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way.
The Turkish Study Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorochine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorohin.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Shanzhen have shown that the favipiravir is "definitely effective."
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the negative result was on average four days later, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
A study was conducted in Uhan, during which 240 patients with pneumonia were monitored, one half of whom received favipiravir and the other half were Umimuvir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the results of the drug & apos; s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to replenish its stocks, and that it would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of buying a drug, which could be less effective in cases of disease.
It may not be safe for pregnant patients or for those who are trying to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Kaletra) anti-virus drugs concluded that "no effective use of drugs has been found."
The alternatives were designed to inculcate the replication of HIV by linking to the prosthetic.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will be linked to the SARS-CoV-2 prosthetic. In the scientific community, the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically designed for HIV and AIDS treatment is being criticized.
WHO has incorporated a combination of Lapinavir and Ritonavir into the international "Solidarity" test.
The Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus, and then the Gilead Science staff found that the belt had an anti-virus activity in vitro for many filo-, pneumo-, paramixo and coronviruses.
One of the problems related to anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that the belt may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical tests are being carried out, including two by the Cleveland University Clinic; one is carried out on patients with a moderate form of disease and the other on patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical tests are under way for the intravenous introduction of vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).

Some antibiotics found to be potentially suitable for use as a COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilimab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab # COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2013 Coronvirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinical, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would be available before 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in the process of being explored and developed to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the safety studies of phase I are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and candidate drug for vaccine: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and candidate drug for vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenvirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been reported, but little information is available (allegedly in the planning or development stage).
In phases I-II, pre-testing is carried out for safety and immunogenicity, usually at a ranking, placebo-controlled and several sites, with more accurate and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III of the tests usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and side effects are monitored at best dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on the person (still in the pre-clinical stage).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a vaccine with a molecular clamp that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical testing and phase I clinical testing by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even in an accelerated regime it would take at least one and a half years or two to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle like the coronvirus.
A potential vaccine is being tested in laboratories and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered "great money" to CureVac for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German Government had protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a vaccine based on IRNC.

On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of the pre-clinical tests in April 2020, and that their final vaccine-candidate could start testing in the fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium, with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Theis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
The other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
The Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The candidate for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine-candidate products in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian Government has announced $192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans to establish a national "vaccine bank," which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the coronvirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from Pittsburgh University Medical School reported testing PittCoVac, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that "MNA introduced sub-unit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, giving strong responses to anti-gene-specific antibodies [in mice], which appeared two weeks after immunization."
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmaceutical School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine, which may be produced in the form of a slurry.
With bacteriphags, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can encourage the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three United States universities joined the IBM supercomputer resources together with the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have advantages other than those of disease prevention.
Another study, which is being carried out in Australia, covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies on the assessment of the effectiveness of animal-based vaccines with COVID-19 models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and low-level prizes, indicate the need for measures to control the infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as for international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for people to treat SARS.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of abnormally pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is no tested vaccine against the MERS.
When the MERS began to spread, it was considered that the SARS study that had been carried out at that time could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapies against the MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine, which had passed phase I of the human clinical test, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus vector-based vaccines and were in the process of being developed, two were adenviral (Chadox1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S-S).
The social media had a conspiracy theory that said that the COVID-19 virus was not new, and that the vaccine already existed.
The social media publications cited the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequences of other coronvirus strains, such as the SARS coronvirus, as well as on vaccines for these strains.
Coronvirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute Coronvirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) respiratory syndrome.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory difficulties.
Other symptoms may include a sense of fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from the first symptom to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also range from two to fourteen days.
The majority of cases are light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mostly spreading in close contact with one another, often through microscopic drops released into the air during cough, sneezing or talking.
While these drops are formed when they are exhaled, they are usually a threat to the ground or to the surface but are not transmitted through long-range air.
People are also infected with the contaminated surface and then with their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live for 72 hours on the surface.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms are present, although it can be spread both before the symptoms are present and at a later stage; the standard diagnostic method is a polymeric chain reaction with a real-time back transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nipple.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients who are suspected of being ill, as well as to those who care for them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population differ: some agencies recommend that they be not used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local prevalence was recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Insured persons may have no symptoms or have no symptoms of influenza such as fever, cough, fatigue and abdomen.
Extreme symptoms include severe respiratory difficulties, constant pain or a sense of abdication in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulties in awakening, facial or lip bruising; if the above-mentioned symptoms are present, medical care should be sought immediately.
There may be symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, flogging or throat pain.
In addition, there are various percentage ratios of the stomach and intestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some cases of disease recorded in China were initially only a sense of abdication in the chest and a growing heart rate.
In some cases, the disease can progress through pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually death.
It's called an incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people are beginning to experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and not all the infected are reported to have symptoms.
The role of such non-symptoms in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected persons with no symptoms is currently unknown and is only being studied; and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitals for the virus were unsymptomable.
The National Health Commission of China began to include no symptoms in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were non-symptomatic at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
In loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore found that, with open cough, drops could be spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission of virus particles is still possible, and the testing of air from air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms showed the presence of a virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary resuscitation (VR), can cause the spraying of inhalation products and, therefore, the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus can spread through faeces, but this risk is considered to be low; the virus is the most consistent when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before the symptoms are present, but the risk is low.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spreading, but it is known that one disease usually infects two or three others, and that the virus is able to survive on the surface for hours to several days.
In particular, the virus was found to be able to live on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99 per cent of copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and cleaning materials, if properly used, have a very useful effect on the control of contamination: the soap destroys the fat protection layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and can remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconychloride and chlorhexide gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus; during a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest blood content of the virus was found on the second day of the test.
The heavy acute respiratory coronvirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronvirus respiratory syndrome found for the first time in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of a new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in natural coronviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens its protective envelope. SARS-COV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the body most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates the host cells through the angiotenzine-transforming enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of the type II lungs.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - "chipa" (peppermeter).
In 12 per cent of the infected persons admitted to the hospital in Uhan, severe damage to the myocardium was diagnosed, which is more common in a severe form of disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the system-based inflammatory response and the immune system violations observed during the progressive disease, but severe damage to the myocardium can also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of this body.
The high rate of trombosis (31 per cent) and venous tromombolia (25 per cent) was observed in patients in the COVID-19 and could indicate negative projections. The atupsis of patients killed by COVID-19 showed that there were diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymph-containing inflammatory infiltration in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a trophism to ACE2-express epitelial respiratory cells, COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that the pathogens of the GM-IFS T cells are correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocitis that emit IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy also found lymph infiltration.
WHO has also published several test reports for the disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained from a noseloin, but a nosebleed or wet sample may also be used.
The results are usually available for a period of between a few hours and two days.
It is also possible to take blood tests, but it requires two blood samples taken at two weeks & apos; intervals, and the results are not of direct importance.
Chinese scientists have been able to release the coronvirus strain and to publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop their own polymeric chain response tests (PCR) to detect the existence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could have detected the presence of an infection at the present time, as well as possible past infections, were under development but were not yet widely available.
China & apos; s experience with the results of these tests has shown that they are only 60-70 per cent accurate.
On 21 March 2020, the United States Food and Drug Quality Control Authority (FDA) approved the first on-site testing test, allowing its use at the end of this month, and the diagnostic instructions issued by the University of Zhonnan Hospital of Uhan include methods for detecting the infection on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
The two-way, multi-point subpleural focus of the "mata glass" type with peripheral, asymmetric and aposterical distribution is a frequent symptom that is detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural domination, the symptom of a brown bridge (the elongation of a partition with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are being developed as the disease progresses.
There is little data on the microscopic damage and the pathophysology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study carried out at the autopsy are:
Macroscopia: plevritus, pericarditis, infirmary, and a swelling of lungs
You can see four types of gravity of viral pneumonia:
Light form of pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasma pneumocite, large anemic pneumocytes, interstitional inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of nuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory stress disorder (ODS) and severe hypoxemia.
Incineration pneumonia: Alveolate exudates and pulmonary interstitious fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse Invascular Flow (LAN-Syndrome); Leukerythroblastic Response
Prevention measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include stay at home, avoid human places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene, and avoidance of contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a napkin during cough or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, to cover the mouth and nose on the inside of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hand hygiene procedure be conducted.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of the infection by persons with no symptoms of disease; the social dislocation strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and enterprises, restricted the movement of citizens and eliminated major public activities.
The recommendations on disconnection also imply that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There are no drugs with proven effectiveness against COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, the main part of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is the reduction of the peak of the epidemic known as the "plateau."
The CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, and before and after food, cough or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (alcohol content at least 60 per cent) for hand treatment, but only when soap and water are not available; regions where such disinfectant products are not sold, WHO provides two prescriptions for local production.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with anti-microbial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate the bacterial dispute in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for the anti-septic treatment of the hands.
Glycerol is added as a moist.
Patients are shown support therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other life-threatening organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diet be respected.
Support treatment can be shown to patients with light symptoms at early stages of the disease, and WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists have consolidated the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend a choice in favour of paracetamol (acetaminofen) as compared to ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health-care facilities, when implementing procedures that may result in air and drip emissions, such as intubation or hand drying.
The CDC recommends that medical workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in an air and cable cell (AIIR), an additional measure, in addition to standard communication and air precautions, and that the CDC issue recommendations on the use of individual protection (IEDs) during the pandemic.
The recommended individual protection items are: a protective robe, a retractor or a medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; of the above, it is preferable to use a respiratory device rather than a medical mask.
The N95 reactors were approved for industrial use, but the FDA authorized the use of these retractors in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used unofficially, the protection effectiveness of a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, at least, the making of masks on their own at home.
In most cases, the COVID-19 current form is not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with a respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-air or two-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods for patients in critical condition are as effective as the IVL.
Some doctors choose to invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the high-air bow canals; the risk of a severe form of disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is a lack of per capita hospital beds, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in a severe form requiring hospitalization.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in resuscitation.
The task of artificial ventilation of the lungs is becoming more difficult, as acute respiratory stress control (ARDS), developed under COVID-19, and oxygenation are increasingly problematic.
The IVL, with the support of the breath pressure and the PDTC, is necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, which can result in the development of pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, a high PDTC may not be available.
Studies on potential treatment techniques began in January 2020 and a number of anti-virus drugs are currently in the process of being tested.
The most promising is the belt.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the tested drugs have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Anti-virus drugs can be tested for patients with severe forms of disease.
The volunteers recommended by WHO are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatment methods.
It has not been subjected to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The application may detect "close contact" with observation data and therefore determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user may also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is found, the application not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities: analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, identification technology, tracking of mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the data of mobile phones of people allegedly infected with coronvirus.
Measures have been taken to provide quarantine and protection for persons who may have contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to research and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the federal government agencies of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, a facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
The Regional Commissioner for Health of Italy, Julio Geller, said that cell network operators reported that "40 per cent of people still travel across the territory."
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
President Kersti Kalulid of Estonia also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronvirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, by-effects of treatment or fear of infection.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: "Increased social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harm to the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may be in light form with little or no symptoms that resemble other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as a normal cold.
Patients with a light form of disease are generally recovered within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need between three and six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of obtaining a heavy form of COVID-19 based on data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there is no such data for COVID-19, and some people can have lung and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In persons with the most severe exposure, COVID-19 can move rapidly into acute respiratory stress control syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory, septic or polyorganic deficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal tromboeducation, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
The injuries of the tromboeducation, especially the increase in the time of the prothrombino, were described in 6 per cent of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while 4 per cent of the kidney function is affected.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminazes).
According to the same report, the average time between the symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive care was seven days.
According to early-stage studies, the average time from initial symptoms to day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Gistopatological studies of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibroxoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes have experienced viral cytopathic changes.
The appearance of the lung was similar to acute respiratory stress control syndrome (ODS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, the heart problems were to raise the level of the cane or to stop the heart.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had prior health problems, and the availability of health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also have an impact on mortality.
The mortality estimates vary according to state, owing to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
A lack of effective calculation of cases in light form could lead to overreporting of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths are due to diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is not appreciated.
In the case of smokers, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more frequent, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or to die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some of the patients who had recovered from the disease had been reduced by 20-30 per cent and that their scanning had revealed injuries.
After recovery, it can also lead to a "After Intensive Treatment" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether there was a strong immunity against the virus-affected patients.
According to other coronviruses, this is considered likely, but it is also reported that after recovery from COVID-19, the coronvirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an increased delay in the disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, of animal origin and an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date for the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the time of the disease, and are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and population parameters such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10: U07.1 emergency codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 for clinical or epidemiological-diagnosed deaths without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV2. The ratio of deaths to infections is the number of deaths recorded over a period of time.
According to statistics from Jones Hopkins University, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153,822 / 2,240 191).
This figure varies from region to region: some other methods include the determination of the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, and the determination of the post-infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect a certain level of the population from the time of infection to the completion of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced for all patients who have been infected, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to understand how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies based on the blood of the donor.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The most at-risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has been reduced only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, associated diseases in men (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) can lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and OWI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health-care workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are therefore more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreissus, explains: "CO" means "crown," "VI" - "virus," "D" - "disease" (disease), and 19 - the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by the international name recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a heavy acute coronvirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In public communications, WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus."
Both the disease and the virus are usually called the coronvirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhan, China, the virus and disease were usually called "coronvirus" and "Uhanka coronvirus."
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms "acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-COV-2" were published.
Owing to the limited volume of standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as noseback tampons, as well as parts of the AVL equipment.
In one such case, the Italian clinic was in urgent need of a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, while one of the local production was reprofiling and able to print the required 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and faxed information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to be disseminated on the Internet at a high rate.
It's possible that people can infect other animals with virus.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international research on vaccines and drugs from COVID-19 is currently being carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial Programme, which aims to assess the treatment effects of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine-candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells with ACE2 receptor, so research uses the results of previous SARS-CoV studies.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at causing a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the immune system & apos; s sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is aimed at destroying the S-chic protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccines, new vaccine development methodology).
The pilot vaccines developed under any of these strategies are to be tested for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers began on 16 March 2020 in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the anti-body increase was identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
The alternatives approved for the treatment of malaria were assessed in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychlorohinine or chlorohino.
The reprofiling of anti-virus drugs is most of China & apos; s research; by the end of April, nine phase III of the resdesivir had been carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 had been carried out, and several other existing anti-virus drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 were also being considered for the same purpose, including the resdesivir, chlorohine and hydroxychlorohine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and lopinavir / ritonavir, combined with the interferon beta.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of the belt are available.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients who received a belt as an exception.
Phase III of the clinical tests is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chlorochine used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorochine.
The Uhan Institute of Virosology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that the doubling of this dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychlorohin and chlorohin at the discretion of the doctors who treat patients with COVID-19. The Chinese guidelines of the 7th edition also indicate interferon, ribavireen or umimituvir as means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazokanide was recommended for a detailed study in vivo, showing the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Research has shown that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the ACE2 receptor requires a primitive of the sirens (TMPRS2).
The studies on the use of chlorochine and hydroxychlorohin with or without azitromicin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatment methods without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inculcate SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
hypercytokinemia may be a complication at the late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxichlorochine may have hypercytokinea properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China has included a totolimab in the recommendation for treatment of the coronvirus.
The drug has reached the second stage of the non-ranking test, which is being carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with a severe form of disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is intended to counter factors that are considered to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by an interlekin-6 receptor on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of the release of steroid refractor cytokin caused by another cause, the T-cell therapy of CAR.
To date, there is no ranking and controlled evidence that tocilimab is an effective cure for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of treated and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is now considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
The strategy was tested for treatment of SARS patients, but the results were not convincing.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-body cell cytotoxicity and / or phagocitosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as mono-clonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of a reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid portion of the blood of the patients who have recovered and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
