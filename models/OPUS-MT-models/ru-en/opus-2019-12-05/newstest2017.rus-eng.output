28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a local mall this week.

The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, who reported to the San Francisco Forensic Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that death has been classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.

Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and suppressed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss him very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had been staying at the hostels first, but recently, "He's finally been on the road."
"He found an apartment, he met a girl," Louis Galicia said KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family was always to make us some food, make us dinner, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who was sailing through the river.

In the central bank, the countries stated that this amount was a historical maximum, and it passed on RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
The amount of public debt then reached 2,228 trillion euros.
It is noted that over the first half of the year, Italy & apos; s debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
The International Group of Biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is a Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, which is transmitting RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenlandic sharks.
The largest shark, with a length of more than five metres, may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the shark's long-term, leading to slow development.
The females of Greenlandic sharks reach puberty only by the age of 150.
It was previously believed that the "neighbor" of sharks, a Greenlandic whale, lived longer than all vertebrate animals.
The oldest person known by the scientists was a little over 210 years old.

Should we go to the sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of Olga Bogush's sanatorium.
And if a man is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need sanatorium and resort rest not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her condition and receive medical advice on how to live so that his or her health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations would not be redundant.
"Just tired of working" is an important signal to the body, and you don't need to get away from it.
Constant stress, mental and physical overdose can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90%.
It is particularly affected by people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to make things more difficult and give yourself a break in time.
Research shows that 98 per cent of people reduce their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to take a vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatrician counselling, tests and treatment.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children & apos; s basins), inhalation, special food, massage, oxygen, therapeutic physical education.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual testimony and the characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, a children & apos; s club with animators is generally run in sanatoriums, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide the necessary conditions for the breast-bearing and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The soft winter, the long summer, the abundance of sundays per year (over 300) create good conditions for a round-the-year rest at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Water.
And then the body needs rest not just in the summer.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather behind the window, especially since most of the procedures are in the room, and they don't depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for older persons.
The main thing in the region of the Caucasus Mineral Water is, of course, the treatment mineral sources: Slavinovsky, Smirnovsky, Jessentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor's picking up the water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Narzan, for example, has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restoring the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the sugar level.
The "Essentuki New" has an anti-inflammatory, yellow and urinary effect.
The water of "Slavinovsky" has the same effects.
In the case of water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there's any signs of hypertension, he's picking up less saline water because the salt is holding the liquid, leading to an increase in pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drank at a certain time, at the appropriate quantity and at a specific temperature.
The sanatoriums now have a variety of cosmetological procedures available to the person and body.
What types of rehabilitation, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, can be obtained from the resorts of the region?
In the vicinity of Pigorska, for example, there is a salted lake of Tambukan, which is a salty mud that is useful for joint, vertebrae, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, sucking, immunomodulating effect.
It's a healthy walk on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovosk, where there is a large resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Populars in Kislovovsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take a bath of wine, pearl, yonder, selenic, sage-lacrical, depending on what you're assigned to be a doctor.
We're going to extend the disease.
What do you do to make the harvest go to the end of the season?
It's about Yulia Belopuhova, the agribusiness and the lady.
It is time for the high-end tomatoes to have a haircut: remove the new pawns, cut the pawns, remove all leaves to the end of the brush with the fruit, and the scolding with the small ties, they will not be able to grow up.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "Constitution," as well as peppers and baklazans, are fed with zine-super-phosphate extraction, and are treated with biotherapies (Vendor - to accelerate the abundance and growth of the fruit, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamayr, Baktofit - from disease, Immunozitophit - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocide, and Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Only copper, colloid sulphur and green soap should be used at the end of the summer.
We're doing the last plant policy.
The long-shoulder cucumbers in the heater are brought down from the spaler so that the lower, bounded part of the stem (25-40 cm) will lie on the ground, water warm water and the solution of the Circone, and we will put the stem 5-7 cm into the compost.
It is also not easy to extend the fruit of the cough: cut old leaves, pour warm water and a solution for the integrated fertilizer, and put the fertile ground under the bush.
In order to protect against night cold, put an arc with a hidden material over the ground.
And keep the plants open by day, and close them after sunrise.
The signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
The economists saw signs of Russia's withdrawal from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to the analysts interviewed by the Bloomberg agency, the GDP of the Russian Federation is showing a positive trend: in the second quarter of GDP, GDP fell by 0.8% annually.
This is a minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently stated that the situation is stabilizing.
It's a slow growth ahead.
According to the CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession has been left behind and the economic growth is slow ahead," is stated in the Bank of Russia's "Trends About."
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been raised by regulators to 0.4 per cent, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonal GDP decline was 0.2 per cent for the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April, it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June, GDP change was between 0 and 0.15, citing the representative of the RIA's "News" ERI.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the last five quarters shows that "the bottom is gone."
Among other markets that indicate signs of a recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg calls an increase in demand for electricity and rail transport, and a revival of business.
If an amendment is made to the fact that the year is visocous, it is clear that the growth in plus 1 per cent of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonal "explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks, Rosstat has been recording deflation.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the rate of rouble, which, while showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12% since the beginning of the year since August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy, "highlighted by Yakovenko.
In addition, since April there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent, is also positive.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of real disposable incomes of the population is to leave much to be desired.
In annual terms, the rate is falling by 4.8 per cent.
This may hamper economic recovery, as household spending has made a significant contribution to GDP.
In general, their share in the structure of the economy is over 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strict policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator holds the rate at 10.5 per cent, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
The low level of investment is also a negative factor, which constrains the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be expected that by the end of the year the Russian Federation's economy will have fallen to -0.5 per cent, compared with -3.7 per cent in 2015, "said the analyst of the Group Club, Irina Rogov.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been developed so actively in summer sports.
If the Rio Olympic Games are for Russia and former foreigners, most of them are from countries that are former republics of the Soviet Union.
In Rio, however, we can see the reverse process - a large number of Russians speak under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of a change of nationality is different.
Some parents were taken to another country as a child without leaving a choice.
Someone has failed to compete for a seat in the Russian team.
And someone thought that there would be better conditions for development in sports abroad.
AIFR found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be Elizabeth, of course.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Only four years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to follow up on her older sister's steps to do an easy athletic.
And so did your sister, Lisa chose to jump from six.
If she were in Russia, she wouldn't be able to "move from the throne" to Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only earner, if not the former, in the sixth jump sector.
Its best achievements in this form of sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental margin in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novoskusnetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious advocates of the Evangelical direction.
In many ways, because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Helena, there were eight more children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started to get into a fight at school.
In showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued to study at the United States Training Centre under the leadership of another former Russian man, Vladislav Isbohnikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost in his first fight.
But at the World Cup that year, it was a win.
Before that, she had, by the way, won silver at the 2010 world.
They were then bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
= = Early life = = Maria was born in Yaroslavle, where she first met the synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
The girl's family soon decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
That's where Maria continued her class.
She was soon part of the United States team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, its performance is a ceiling.
A new name, which in Russian sounds strange, was given at 11, when her parents decided to continue to teach the girl art gymnastics after the ocean.
Until now, the girl had been a favorite sport in her mother's Yaroslava.
When she moved to the United States, she quickly entered the country's youth team and later entered the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, Kristen won gold and silver.
In the first positions on the world stage, of course, it did not have to fight, but for the United States, it organized a real breakthrough, leading a star-striped team to the Rio Olympics.
Another former "artist" is Jana Berezh-Margrander, who is in favour of Germany's team.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects of entering the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, indeed, Jana was only able to occupy 17 places, not enough to get into the final competition in his personal first place.
But two years before that, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, the young.
Another gymnast, only this time, is Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes are standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is a student at the Volgograd Sports School.
In Iceland, of course, she immediately became a champion of the country.
It is true that Ira is training in Russia, but he is coming to his home country on purpose, so that he will not lose his skills.
In Rio, she did not do as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal polyboria.
There is very little information about Mary Ugolkova's fruit in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had been under the Russian flag, showing good results - even a record of the country at a distance of 200 metres of bathterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to speak under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14 in the 4x100 integrated estafete.
In order to get into the game, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that brought together some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hasavurta's born-in-law was able to become a three-time prize for European championships, a Russian champion, and a Russian master of international-class sports.
When he stopped entering our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from sports aids.
The triumph was held at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and took a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in the country than even the Swiss maiden Maria Ugolkova.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started his sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was a 40-seat qualification in parallel strains.
But for New Zealand, even having to go to the Olympic Games in sports gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her training in synchronous swimming, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the 2014 European Championship in Berlin, the girl took sixth place in the synchronous swimming.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia was ranked eighth.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croiter is in favour of Israel's team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to return to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitri was 17 years old and was a champion of the country.
He won the World Youth Championship in the same year.
One year later, Croiter won the gold of the Singapore Youth Olympics.
In addition to the high jump, Dmitri is a long jump and a three-way jump.
Albert, 31-year-old, is another born of Hasavurt, who, after long speeches for Russia, decided to change his sports nationality.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he was also a champion of the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports, even as a champion of the country in 2011.
= = Biography = = Oleg Antonov, 28, was born in Moscow in the family of a player of the Soviet Union in the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
Only one year before the birth of Yaroslav's son, he was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family also remained in permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a bronze prize for the European Championship in his new home country.
= = Biography = = Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was born with his family at the very height of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was the original target, but it was not possible to reach that northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won peace among the young people, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the competition.
And again a free struggle, and again an ex-Russian.
This time, it is about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain - Timuraz Freeva.
He was granted Spanish citizenship at the end of December 2012 and is now in favour of his team.
Before that, a 30-year-old athlete had a high record in Russia as well.
He became the bronze prize of the country's 2007 and 2008 championships.
The statute of non-entry into the team, Timuraz decided to change his sports nationality.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital, Dagestan Mahachkale, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was 10 years old, the parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started working on the boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became a champion of the world among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslav won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why would the children of the Kazakh school class?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "it is not the acts and parades that need to be brought up in a systematic manner, but rather by action and parades."
They must grow up and, at least since the age of seven, understand that they are Kazakhs and the education must be Kazakh.
But so far, I think, this work is being done in a formal manner and I suspect more on paper.
If the Kazakh classes take on all the positive things that have been built up before, at a qualitatively new level, I would be pleased.
If everything is as good as it is, the new idea will turn out to be a cheap populism.
The SCC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country & apos; s economy.
There is an encroachment on funds allocated to the public sector from different levels of budget.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, high tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of the SCC.
As a result, the region & apos; s consumers have overpaid more than 170 million roubles for energy.
In the days, the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Krasnodar Province also found that there were unnecessary costs included in the tariffs.
In addition, 4 million roubles were charged to the costs of the IV-Consulting (cold water) LOC for the rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And there are a lot of examples of that in the country.
The people give the last money for the "public" and pay it properly, and according to the Ministry of the Interior, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged directly under several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund that had been responsible for the renovation of urban facilities, Makarov had concluded contracts with entrepreneurs and had not actually been carried out but paid for them.
The business people just gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the KK, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own.
As a result, there are millions of roubles to the budget and to the residents.
A scheme of Makarov's mimics, alas, is typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who have given money to citizens.
The trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is still under way in Kamčatka, by the former member of the Council of Mines, who is being accused of being involved in a 91.7 million roubles of fraud.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established 6 company managers and 3 limited-liability societies in Elysivo Camchata province.
One of them had contracted for the Criminal Code, and the other two had played the role of a clearing house, that is, taking money from the public.
However, A. Cohan did not spend his money on his energy, but spent on himself, my love.
It's difficult to be a court of law in the area of the SCC.
It's not a case, it's a matter of time.
And "helps" in this very complicated housing legislation, Svetlana Rizortnev, the executive director of the NP, "SCC Control."
We are not in a position to make one law, as we are making up a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few experts, including judges, on SCC issues.
The legal profession itself recognizes that very little attention is paid to housing law in higher education institutions.
The Office of the Attorney-General also reports that criminal proceedings have been refused and that the police have been subjected to torture during the investigation.
Of the 3,000 crimes in trial in 2015, less than half were brought to court.
The remaining investigations have taken a long time, and one in five has been suspended due to the failure of the accused to establish a person.
Often, the shortcomings of law enforcement agencies have been attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, with only 60 criminal cases.
In the five months of this year, there has been only a slight increase of 99.
What is the falsification of the tenant's meeting report?
This means changing the management of the house, financial and other matters are bypassing the views of the owners.
It also means that the housing and public services market cannot be opened to normal companies that want to work honestly, not to "pay" the population.
So, the tenants are out, the small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the State, I am sure Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Committee on Property.
This work is now under way.
These are not just single-handedly actions, but are targeted against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital does not smell like scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown the iron will and order, Anatoly, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told the AIF.
I am referring to both human resources and legislative amendments and legal education.
Management companies have been closely monitored and all have been licensed.
The complaints of the urban population are promptly resolved in the public area (and in the cases of the residents, and the response is posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but they closely monitor what is written there, how the house is held.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and of the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of the tariffs on housing and public services, since a large part of the budget is allocated to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess all of this together explains the calm in Moscow.
So it's all in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's worth a change of place of work, you know?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the US?
President Rejep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey put forward an ultimatum for the United States, proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülin, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d & apos; état.
He said that by speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to give up their support to the "terrorist organization of the fethullahists."
This is not the first statement from Turkey to call on the US to change its position.
The experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO."
Either the FETO or a democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice, "cited by the Anatolian Agency, Erdoğan's appeal, which was made on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but already more strongly demanded that the US comply with his first-time demand after the suppression of the rebellion.
We recall that, on the night of 16 July, the Turkish army & apos; s high-level representatives in Turkey attempted to overthrow legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Rejep Erdogan had addressed the population, the rebellion had been repressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
A total of about 8,000 people were suspected, with teachers and scientists in addition to the military.
According to Rejep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülin, a resident of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdoğan's supporters also assumed that the coup d & apos; état could also involve Americans directly.
The Panel recommends no compensation in the amount of USD 43,840 for all claims against it by refusing to extradite Gülin and by giving advice to change the tone.
The last statement made by State representatives on this subject was made at the time of Erdoğan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - it has insisted on its own and also has made demands on its other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not call a date for the lifting of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens," announced on 9 August by the Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik.
He said that Ankara & apos; s amendment of the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe & apos; s own security.
We note that on 1 August, the German Vice-Chancellor, Ziegmar Gabriel, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open the borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of the Head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Melovita Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu was made on the past Wednesday, assuming that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider leaving the alliance unless it received the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign States in the defence field - missiles are being imported, "said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own system of defence based on its own technologies, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not been satisfactory, and we have begun to look for others," the Minister said.
The experts believe that this is a reflection of Turkey & apos; s serious differences with the West and the country & apos; s transition to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Rejep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a hard confrontation with the West.
He has very much to do in the West, both in terms of business and military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a full-time man in this position, "the expert from AIFR explained.
He said that it was possible that, following a statement by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, on the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and on the extradition of Gülin from the United States), he would be pressured.
"Rejep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, on dictatorial methods of governance of the country, and so on," Minchenko considers.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, accepts that the President of Turkey will change his views with Russia as soon as he benefits.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very firm position against Russia and sought, in all ways, the propensity of the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdogan's been in shuttle diplomacy.
When he is between the two Poles, the West and Russia, he will try to maximize his benefits, "Muhin believes.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today was to hold political power in the country, and for that to happen, he needed Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the US would stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which, through it, control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey, "the expert considers.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazov, has a different view.
Turkey's relationship with both the EU and the US is now rather tense, and this is due primarily to the domestic policy that Erdogan is personally pursuing.
I believe that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated and, in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not by accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, say that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, that relations with Israel are settled, that there is active political engagement with Iran, "explained to AIFR Glazov that the next step is for Erdoğan to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy currently being pursued by Erdogan was to return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey had followed before the Arab revolution.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region at zero with its neighbours.
The Turkish President's very successful visits to Russia and Africa have now taken place.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position on both the regional and international levels, "the expert considers.
It is the view of the Glazova that it will be extremely difficult for Turkey to return to its former relationship with the EU, but rather, the question is whether the EU will respond to Turkey in a hard way, which can open up borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
A strike by junior doctors: Call for new collective protests
The representatives of the junior doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute about a new employment contract.
The JDC of the British Medical Association (BMA) is about to ask its full board to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers have not been able to answer the questions about the employment contract.
In July, junior doctors and medical students voted to cancel a contract of employment agreement with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members, published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had continued to "remain silent" on the issues that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "In view of the situation, the JDC leader voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC leader today made a formal request for an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to approve a continuing programme to expand collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The BMA leader, Dr. Joan Malavan, resigned after voting for the cancellation of the agreed terms of the contract of employment recommended by BMA.
He told the BMA members that the deal was a good one to take during the meetings leading up to the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to a golden palace in St. Petersburg, I had a strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was too tight, and he barely emit heat even by his own limited standards.
Rejep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" to Mr. Putin, five times according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even to higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdoğan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was unruly.
Mr. Putin has been subjected to bitter tyranny, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The grief was even more severe, on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media carried out a staggering, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdoğan & apos; s own family had earned from the illegal trade in oil from Syrian areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it with determination.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only took place because Mr. Putin received an apology that he requested from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim a victory of a kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost out of office last month when he attempted a coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have severely hit - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, travel operators and charter companies will, of course, be relieved when the flights are finally resumed.
They're putting the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists over there, tomatoes back here," as stated in the report in the paper.
But the visit was also of additional political value to Moscow.
Ankara is evil to the West for thinking she's a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to this the long-standing discontent of the turtle with the pace of the EU accession talks and the step of Mr. Putin - who is seeking to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup d & apos; état.
It is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit at this brilliant palace on the sea coast has allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as a "bad alliance": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
However, despite the public show of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently position itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
Perhaps it is for itself that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two Presidents had given a press conference, they had not even addressed the issue.
The President of Turkey had deliberately avoided the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin had chosen to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language for Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the possibility of a complete disaster when a NATO member hit a Russian fighter - it is better that at least two leaders speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brent RBS should be a back office, according to the bank's executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McAwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been back from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, the brands were used by RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from the six-nation rugby Cup to Wimbledon's champion, Andy Murray.
But it has now been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to the RBS, including the external head office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brend Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller, brands for the banking of private individuals that will have greater influence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McAwan gave an interview on a tour of clients and staff to Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brent RBS will eventually be our investment brand and the one where our staff will be involved, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, the RBS became a global brand.
I'm just saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something very different in their population groups, and our staff will work with their clients under these brands.
The RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up a profile of various brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"This is a good time for us to move the brand bank, because in the base (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the client bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for our clients and close all those brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori is up to 3,000 winners with a win at Newmarket on Priestess.
The Dettori sprinkles champagne after a take at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 victories.
Joke Frankie Dettori won his 3000 British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, on the Priestacy trained by John State.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that has reached this remarkable mark in smooth races.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Ideri and Willie Carson.
The three-time Jockey Dettori champion, who had previously won the Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal Acot, it's a regular Friday night since 200 people.
I'm free from business and very intangible.
The Dettori takes the applause when he brings the Preface after the victory.
Two jockeys reached such a point in the race with obstacles: the Jockey champion Richard Johnson and a retired 20-time champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 victories for a record career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time winner of Derby, 4493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and no wonder he reached that point, which so few have ever reached before.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical mix that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He's a great representative for the races, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Eps, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey and big races!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners to the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British races, but, more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a firm, fast-moving horse.
From the fast end to the fast end, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth races for two decades.
It was take-off and fall.
Many of the winners of the big races, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified because of doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed a great deal of will to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while - Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to take part in the competition, at least until he was 50.
Putin is firing the head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted passing circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed a representative for environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President," but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov & apos; s deputy, Anton Vajno, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Vainno, 44, a former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the Office of the President & apos; s Protocol and the Government & apos; s Office, and reports to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release from his post and recommended that Vanjno replace him.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that Moscow has been puzzled by.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on State television, both men stated that the head of administration had resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile on the camera, it's not enough to convince anyone here - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement - that a man who was once promoted as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy - was met with a great skepticism.
In Putin's comments, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to trust me with this very difficult position, even a problem post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the head of the President's office for four years and eight months.
He took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could be President of Russia after Putin's second term, since Putin's third term would be in conflict with the Constitution.
However, this post was held by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
The star of "Thinking like a criminal" by Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with the producer.
Gibson was a part of a rookie at a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which make the series, announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in the film and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened, "he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that is following the FBI team are expected to be received later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a major role in the "Darma" and "Greg" sitcom was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love" To think like a criminal "and put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," said Gibson in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our great team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
It is scheduled that the show will be back with its twelfth season on September 28.
The plot: the fish landed in the Banfa garden.
A man from Banfa sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane thinks 75 fish could be sandwiches left with a water death.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, has put a picture of this show in Perisap, hoping that someone can shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Quinsmegri Kusking: The bridge is now connected to the Fife.
The 1.35 billion pounds project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern flight and the Viaduk of Quinsmegri Kusking - which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the "veers of the sheet," which are now coming to an end near all three pilots of the bridge.
The Fif bridge section now has 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vans of bridge.
The 1.35 billion pounds project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsmegri Kusking.
We are all witnesses to engineering art of a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the viaduca and the bridge floor is a mercury operation with very accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79 per cent of the total bridge cover is now on the ground, and for the last section, the concrete cover is being identified in Royt today, which means that everything is ready to be raised on the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said, "The first flush on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this link is the most modern construction art.
After the last section of the road lane was installed and its connection with the expanding northern pilot's road strip was then left to close the remaining gap on the north - or towards the bank - side.
This was done by trimming the northern approach by 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and, at the same time, very sophisticated operation.
The scale, because a Viaduca of 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to an angle of about 3%.
The real one, because the tolerances that the team was working on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Gulf of Moelf: Three men were lucky to be alive.
Three men were lucky to be alive after being thrown off a fishing ship in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 13: 20 on British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident in the Gulf of Moelft.
Three men tried to make their way to a safe place, while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship rushing around them and assuming the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones' steering lifeboat.
"Luckily, by the time we went down to the water, the strong wind took it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, 60 years old, was found incapacitated and caught in a buoy without a life vest.
All of them were taken aboard the shore lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men who are thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat engine had an emergency bleach, but somehow it got away from the man who was driving the boat when it was over.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a good hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to see the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at the screen, was a complaint from many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go separates people from the couch and involves them in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games, and recently smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the pokémon Go, an application based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later created a series of cartoons, game cards and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this has become more relevant a few times before this new game was made available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was delayed due to a mass response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost the same number as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphones are going to look for Pokemons, who are being tracked by GPS and, if found, can be 'photographed' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that was playing the game as a younger man joined the maze, disappearing from the divan for search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a "regular" person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an application for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently informed Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people being tracked, who were performing 30-minute exercises on a daily basis, had jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not been answered, because most health messages are boring and are made by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it brings people out to do what they love.
Thus, the three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on a hunt.
As usual, there are boring nags who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yeah, someone might run into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphones applications such as Fitbit might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us any reason to do what this game gives us.
The new one will come, and the use will be weakened over time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins the gold of absolute permanence in female gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the fuss.
Simone Biles is not vulnerable to all this.
Dynamic on the support jump.
Unforced on the logs.
Staggering on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast was promoted to the title of the full-time championship on Thursday, placing a gap between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and a fellow on the "Final Five" team, Ali Reisman, and the Russian bronze medalist, Alia Mustafa.
Biles from the United States is on the gymnastic bridge during the finals of the women's individual absolute art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles was the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of the championship of absolute title and the fifth at all, strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation and possibly ever.
She was torn apart when her final general score was shown and her long journey was over.
This achievement places her in the same league as very rare easy athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
The Biles have spent the last three years dominating their own sport, winning 15 medals of the World Cup - including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their labour-and-accuracy mix that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Reston called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the world, but between her and a load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bills from the United States, on the left, and Ali Rysman are hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final of the female individual absolute art gymnastics at the Summer Olympics of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Biles made the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a farewell party for the outgoing coordinator of the national team, Martha Carole.
While Biles insisted that she never looked into the future on her long journey to the top, that's not exactly the case.
Part of her free exercise programme - the one that includes her commercial passage - is set on Latin American music that would be right at home on the street just outside the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and her grandmother, being a child, who was opened by Coach Amy Burman's mother during her visit to the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost a single full-time competition since the summer of 2013 - a series of luck that should last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafa got a little advantage with two rotations, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic logs and free exercises - where Biles is defending the World Champion - are in ambush.
She went forward again from 15.433 on the log and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman had a soft hug on her while they were waiting for the final account - a clear formality - and the tears appeared around a shiny red with white and blue eyelashes for Biles' eyes when the design that she had once set out on the album for the trimming was realized.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge in four years ago, when she shared the third place, but lost to the bronze of Mustafa on a tai-brec.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "grandmother" was much ahead of us.
She sent a kiss to the crowd after her free exercise, a return that sometimes seemed to be in question.
In the case of Biles, the virus tweet of 19 years from the beginning of this week now has a very new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade had been in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12, when their car was parked on the carriageway, and the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight rounds from a gun standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he fled on another vehicle, he was reported.
The police claim that a triple murder does not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
The Phoenix police officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had led the investigators to see if he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a CBS branch, at the beginning of this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lyner, 31, and Ellis's daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder and was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and removed the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalus: "It's getting better."
As most six-year-old children, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephalus, a result of a genetic violation his mother Elizabeth Pixivto didn't know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for that.
Which is actually not true - of course you're signing up for it, "she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized treatment facility.
"My first answer was," I didn't think people were still doing that, "Pixivto explained.
Edmund goes with the walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he's still not talking.
But he's slowly passing some stages.
He goes outside and goes on a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing me."
"We teach him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented her own gestures.
Micro-cephalitis may arise from a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from such viruses as measles and Zica.
Symptoms and projections can vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zick virus.
Pixivto remembers emotional losses from an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a life forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for the mothers of children with birth defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
The heavy rain, the flooding, is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until and including Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service reported that many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and south of Mississippi had left the coast and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bell Edwards, stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that there were requests for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only Tanjipahua's parish had asked for tens of thousands of sacks of sand.
The risk of flooding remains valid until Saturday in most of the south of Louisiana.
Meteunajba said in the statement that an additional 3-5 inches could go into the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood was on duty until Friday, as it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Eimite River near Denem Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a record of the flood level in the past weekend.
The synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could have flooded many houses in the peri-urban areas near Baton Ruga.
He also said that the flooding going downstream in the Assenshen parish was a threat, as those faded rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The rescue workers were still taking people out of the flood in Eimite and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi State.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepmother were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet away from his house, are up fast in the night.
He said the other stepson who lives next door warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest influx she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the rescue officers saved all three by an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krutmann says that the flood is "rapidly spreading," as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Kruthmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Kruthmann said the soil was overloaded with rain from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets have led to the rescue of residents from their homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, the authorities say.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that Councilman Tanjipahoa has reported 200 flooded houses.
The residents have been evacuated to two churches, but they are both on their way.
The President of Robbie Miller's parish said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Eimite and the city of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They'll have a chance to come home as soon as the water's back," he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tanjipahua, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sand bags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum's city manager.
It's on the way to being a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the overrun rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that a number of houses had been registered as flooded on Thursday, but no houses had been registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the manager of the Shopper Value Foods store at Eimite, has been living in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Tauson said, "and it's still on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "bullet-torn," remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting in a 6-year-old town this week.
The baby's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandmother and the grandfather say Brown received many gunshot wounds, including his flesh, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was slashed with bullets," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez, of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has had several surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade in local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were registered in a stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car near a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been shot.
The investigators report to the CBS of Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
The semi-automatic weapons cartridges, which are attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, have cleared the place of operation.
It seems that it was definitely a long fight.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the exchange of fire, "the station was reported by the police captain, Philadelphia Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests had been made and the police were reportedly looking at security cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hand of a stray bullet on Tuesday when he played in front of his home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call the female Olympic team for this year's gymnastics and for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts playing a key role in this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernández, who have already inspired so many black girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Ali Reisman, who is a Jewish, and Madison Cochan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks at last like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Gabby Douglas Olympics, he was a surprise Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world has now witnessed the incredible performance of the three-time World Cup of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, performing unexpected but yet virtuous gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a woman's individual absolute first.
And Ali Rysman's team colleague made silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in gymnastic sections all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five," because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Carole's career.
But, in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay for the cost of education, equipment, travel, form, contributions for participation in competitions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnists get everything from their training, and it's a expensive and long-term responsibility for the gymnast families.
Amy Burman, the coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Hani, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athlete from the moment they took on gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable training for the gymnastics of the communities of the few young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastic fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to hard work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has had a positive impact throughout life on good health, school success and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that thousands of girls will be sent into gymnastics, and that is great.
It's so important to do sports, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Forces to win the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The nurses took further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal.
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing on a revised agreement with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted had rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, saying that NHS was on "no one's land" and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work to improve services in the absence of work.
Dr. Helen McCot, Chairman of the BMA Young Doctors' Committee, said in a statement last night: "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is fuelling the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors."
There is only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The attempt by the WMA to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with a reluctance to act and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, to encourage introduction and to respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are clear that they are ready to organize further strikes.
The last round at the end of April delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing on a amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The VMA wants better payment for the weekend for 54,000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, called on the junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said, "The strikes reach little or nothing, but put pressure on the teams and services that are already working on limits, and cause concern, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Associate Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics - such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health to meet the conditions of the WMA in November, February and May.
A 2-a-day crime can reduce the threat of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a 2-pound-a-day drug after the authorities have recommended that they be given more people for a longer time.
The antiretrogressive drug of the cyclagalore reduces the risk of re-attacks for people with heart problems.
The penalty is already set for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or new attack.
The NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has advised that it be given to people for four years in order to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of the United Kingdom has now advised that it be given to people for four years in order to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and stroke result from the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the artery and the formation of the whores.
If a knucklehead breaks apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the blood flow and block the bleeding to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagror, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the clot less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagalore for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of the NICE Medical Technology Evaluation Centre, said, "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that the cyclaglar, combined with the aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and stroke in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use them.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the Tiger - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that period.
The culture of ownership of the PK allows the falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim areas to flourish
The ex-mayor of the Tower-Hamlet Lutfour Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, serving as a good government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of the count of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the Government & apos; s destructive report today.
A former member of the Cabinet, Sir Eric Pickles, is being criticized by the police, election observers and the city administration for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of "excessive sensitivity to race and religion."
The former Secretary of Local Communities, now an anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that the police had to be allowed to place cordon outside the polling stations in order to protect the scared voters.
He suggested that voters should take identity cards to prove who they were when they voted.
To date, voters must only indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests that unwashed ink be placed on people's fingers when they pass their ballots, so as to prevent someone from voting twice.
Better protection must be provided to informants, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a ballot scandal in Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court held that the current mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office because of a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had kept its critics silent, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "conducted his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the believers to vote for it."
Up to 300 votes were questioned or the result of a character, when a person votes by representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about post-election fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for a candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a few recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: "Evidence has been provided of the pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote on the will of the senior, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"It was feared that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of" political correctness "over ethnicity and religion."
Cheer Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from the ballot papers to stop "voting harvest."
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for rigorous registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is under consideration.
Use unwashed ink on people's fingers as soon as they throw their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To conduct systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
To prevent political actors and activists from working with full-time correspondence and mail-ballot envelopes.
To give the police the power to set up cordon around the polling stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the 1983 People & apos; s Act
To make it illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to a one-by-one booth.
Sir Eric is aggressively attacking the city police, claiming that it is "amazing," that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower-Hamlet case.
"The electoral court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts," he said.
He was found guilty without reasonable doubt - a criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
It also criticizes the failure to "check for the purpose of ticking" of the electoral registration offices of urban administrations.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's ruling in Tower Hamlet was a signal of awakening.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some organs threaten that good reputation.
Cate's bike-like crazy, and other double-diaries of the Rio Olympics.
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy on a French bike player, Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be an impressive match to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old member of the Olympic Games is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous double - at least on social media.
So, after the Rio Games and all the famous people who are on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has made a list of Olympians with more than a superficial similarity with the Hollywood stars.
A hunter and wolf: The men's team of the United States, Brady Ellison, on the left, have been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, a lot of people online hasty to point out how a certain archer could be a twin to the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the United States men's team, Brady Ellison, was the cause of a hurricane on Twitter after images of him appeared, looking frightening like the Wolf of Wallstreet.
And in fact, the archer found out about social media insanity and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a great resemblance, maybe with the exception of vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point to even more this year: the striking similarity between the British jumper Greg Diserford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Alia Mustafa, with her big, express eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African swimmer's pool, Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to Hor Matthew Morrison's star for years.
To the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is the "sports version" of the actor has started.
Another long-standing comparison was between the tennis player, Rafael Nadar, and the actor, Josh Harnett, who could be praised by similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist from Russia, Yulia Efimov, can not only brag about the same burnt skin and light hair as the actress Annalinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the United States team, according to fans, is like the "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte."
Sad women: Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, on the right, have the same facial and eye forms.
One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why this couple's appearance is similar.
One Twitter user recently approached the site to make public his admiration that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the US football star and the actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial and eye forms.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Linney, as well as the winning Gabby Douglas, a gold medal that can brag at its own beautiful broad smile, which is like the smile of Gabriel Union's success star.
The C.B.C. Commentator apologizes for saying "died like a pig"
An analysis of Byron McDonald number four on the 14-year-old Ai Yanghan finish on a 4x200-m free-style female estafete was an affront to the CBC audience's live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian broadcasting company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese scent "started as a stink" and "died as a pig" during a swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final female 4x200 m free-style estafet.
You could hear McDonald, who was called on the CBC team to "take it down in colour," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, starting like a stink, dying like a pig.
Thank you for that.
China's Inner Ai Yanghan, who is 14 years old, sailed the second phase of the estafete in 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to close the gap from China.
The audience across Canada responded quickly on the network after being shocked by the tone and the expression used
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC dictator just say that a 14-year-old woman from China 'died like a pig'?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air. "
On Ai Yanghan from China, in the final of the women's 4x200 m, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
The critic on Twitter immediately hit Byron McDonald, and many called him to fire.
Twitter users didn't keep up when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us look like a bunch of racists. # Disguised.
Soon after that, Scott Russell, who was the one who was doing the CBC, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We are sorry that the comment on the swim was on the air."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened. "
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
The commentator's friend Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network also rushed to apologize and issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to live.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers live and our followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the prowess, not about her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and bad choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words would be exhausted as an attack on an individual.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's play, 'he said at the BBC Olympics.'
'I was talking about the performance of the bad guy, not her face. '
'Of course, there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry. '
The Primark buyer insulted a woman who was unshy in her underwear in the middle of a shop.
The buyers didn't know where to look when some woman got enough to try on the panties on the floor with the stores in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them out and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkstone.
The Primark shop at the Bouverie Place in Folkstone, where a woman took the three-bit panties before putting them back on the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after her underwear was masked, a mysterious woman had again "dressed up and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the mall, she took a couple of panties off the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a safe place to do it, she was just standing there, shameless."
"Everyone was staring when she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to three other couples before she finally decided there was nothing she liked, dressed up and out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her or what she thought about the person who would eventually buy those panties that she tried."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's a shame to think that someone is going to take home the panties that someone else was already wearing, and they were not washed."
The incident took place Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff seemed to have tried to get these items out of the market after she left, the better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's cowards and find out that another woman had put them on and taken them off, and they were not washed."
Primark's representative said, "Primark knows about an incident that happened at our store in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9."
All of the items in question were removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from assault with a gun using a Krav-Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If you go in the back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire.'
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then it follows the knee in the flesh, and while the attacker is diving from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, you hit it in the face with a gun, and you go back in the back, holding the weapon on him.
For an armed, right from the front, the way you do the same is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and turn it out so that the evil man can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest, then put the gun out of his grip before you step back and target him.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery - if you're not the master of the Krav-Maga - is to give up your cash.
For the guide, a traveler, Jan Wright, has his own language on the most dirty places in Europe.
The British traveller has subjected his immune system and the vomit reflex to a serious test, denouncing some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of the travel books, Jan Wright, aged 51, from Saffolk, held a language on the euro note, the Circa Pickadili perils, a toilet-flush button on the train and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's getting into.
But the experiment, which is to be a film called "The Lizun-Traveler's Guide to the Internal Force," has produced some amazing results.
The idea of licking a flush button on a train that is used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the European mission, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about increasing intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Luckily, none of the licked ones brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright was known for his bowel strength tests, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public on the train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has certainly been tested by his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, "Since I was a kid, I've been completely indifferent to my health and I've been dragging a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he's given up is the dirty Russian public bathroom.
His test mask showed a luminometer of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the hands just washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public bathroom he refused to wear after its luminometer value was more than 4,000, while the hands just washed were less than 60.
Wright and a Finnish dairy producer, Valio, made a film on a traveler called "The Lizun Traveler's Guide to the Internal Force," which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example, in the toilet.
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lizun Travel Guide for the Internal Force" was taken with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamin C and D, to help accelerate human intestinal bacterial growth and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for the snacks, nico woorenmaa and new categories said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brain attack that ended with the "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a more context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestine health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide more information to consumers about this in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hacala, who was the director of the film, added, "Let's say I would have lost respect for Jan if he were to lick some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, some things to Jan were easier to lick, and some were pretty hard.
I'm glad that some of these lesions we've been able to get on tape. "
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen bacteria exclusively to good stomach and intestine conditions, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The Huliganov family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall's municipal house, on the eve of the eviction.
The Huligans left their municipal house with a loss of 50,000 pounds after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from the real estate, the shocking officials of the housing and construction cooperatives found the real estate in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with gushing holes, the halves were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor, and the walls were filled with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a landlord at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this real estate is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad name, and their name is a bad name.
The couple had three children who had been living in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of terror caused by the family had included fighting on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of people living in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and wickedness.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms of the house that could be demolished, they found old garbage.
The floor of the house in which drugs were sold in the past were removed.
Neighbors say they saw a fight on the street and called the police on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The village was welcomed with ease by the neighbours, who said that their lives had been made a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning. '
We're up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the leader of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Team, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and was regularly called by the police.
The trash and old toys were put down on the bottom of the municipal house.
He added: "It is a shame that the lessee has not been able to take any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, since eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrible for her observing neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and the members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms after the eviction
Residential workers will now have to take out the bags of garbage surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as scales, related supplies and 1700 ppm in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possession of class B drugs for supply.
She stated that the money was being used to pay for the tomb for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the houses were graffiti-packed all over the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who are not in compliance with the rent rules.
Angela Crowe, from the Devon and Cornwall police, stated that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can behave without being accused by the prosecutor, as well as those who are being harmed by such behaviour, 'she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified when a flying military aircraft almost touched the beach.
In the town of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to be on a sunshine were terrified for their lives.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low.
The Air Force reported that it had carried out a training flight but had insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when the flying plane is spiking over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The survivors were on their feet as soon as they became, for understandable reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of a number of rest workers who published a video of a shocking passage on social media, said, "He was flying very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point, that he was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing, and I swear, there was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveira beach were horribly scared when the plane came out of a fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft had conducted a training flight to find fishing vessels off the shore and had to be so low as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft was slightly lower than usual because of the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one had been at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal, as well as the lives of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances - the thick fog and the swelling from the forest fires, which had made the visibility worse.
The aircraft carried out a training flight and the pilot was assigned to identify fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for more than a year, but most of Peterburg's cafes and restaurants have not yet been implemented.
The checks are increasing, and the business is facing fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For over a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian version of HASP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by food producers and carriers, as well as by companies in the field of common water in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
The Roszuzahad & apos; s business checks for compliance with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials only issue fines for certain violations of the regulations (see "List of documents...").
In general, the failure to comply with the regulations would cost the enterprise 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
The HASP, a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, was designed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of the astronauts' food.
The system is now being used in all food enterprises, not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on TC.
The development and implementation of the system in the business was 4 years (the HASSP requirement appeared in the TC technical regulations in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule only applies to food production and not to restaurants, as explained by the head of the Social Council, Elena Cereteli.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August and early September.
But they will not call for an agiotic demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencies sent a letter to the Government yesterday requesting that the charters be authorized.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of a quality and accessible sea rest is intractable, as most of the facilities are already booked before the end of September on the resorts of the Krasnodar province and the Republic of Crimea," notes the authors of the letter and stresses that the opening of charter operations in August will not have a significant impact on the already established demand for the Russian maritime turf.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Turin (RST), if the air services of Russia and Turkey are quickly agreed, the return of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding, when the charters are resumed, is not yet available, depends first and foremost on the aviation authorities.
It is technically possible to fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly set up programmes and deal with the airlines required on board, "said Pavel Ruzyatsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but would not have a much impact on the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - had already returned from their homes and were preparing for school or taking leave in other countries.
During the velvet season, most of them are single travelers and couples.
Chartered programmes can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously, "said Pavel Rumenitsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it now gives very budgetary proposals - 50-60,000 roubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," said Valeria Rosenthal, the general director of the Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, it is not worth counting on, but the main mass of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumenitsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charters will also be required, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season," said Pavel Rumenitsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season," is agreed by Valery Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NNFL of compensation payments established by law, within the limits of the approved rules for compensation for injury caused by injury or other damage to health.
Article 222 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the extradition of milk to workers working in hazardous working conditions.
At the same time, the rules and conditions for extradition are set out by order No. 45 of the Ministry of Social Development of the Russian Federation of 16 July 2009.
According to this document, free provision of milk or other equivalent food is made to workers on the day of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful working factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these rules, the Federal Republic of the Russian Federation, in the letter under consideration, concluded that, on the basis of article 217 (2) (3) of the Criminal Code, the income of the value of milk granted to workers on the days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions is exempt from the imposition of the Act of 16 May 2009 No. 45.
The Moscow "Gazstrucbank" was not licensed by the CBI.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation revoked the licence to carry out banking operations from the credit organization of the Actionary Commercial Bank "GAZTROYBANK" registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the AO ACB GAZTROIBANC has implemented a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank & apos; s assets have led to the credit organization & apos; s reasons for implementing measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, a credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank shall have a temporary administration until the time of appointment to the competitive administrator or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization have been suspended under federal laws.
AO ACB "GAZTROYBANK" is a member of the contribution insurance system.
It will be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to the bank's investors, including individual entrepreneurs, is provided for in the amount of 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles per investor, in accordance with Federal Act No. 177-FZ on the insurance of the contributions of natural persons in the banks of the Russian Federation.
Payments, according to the Contributions Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016
According to the data, in terms of the assets of the AO, the ACB "GAZTROYBANK" was 335 in the Russian banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasnim Akunji, stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she died from a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a stronghold in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this - such as a tomb and a will to others, is that these are the risks that are involved in the journey to a war zone - to persuade people to ever make the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other school girls from East London took a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultanate family said that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Harland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Justice if elected
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Harland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonio Skalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he was predicting that Clinton would choose Harland "with some confidence."
The representative of Reed later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she was going to run Harland, and he was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reed stated that the Republicans who are blocking Harland's nomination are the "tails" and "accomplices" of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said that Trump was not suitable for the job.
Toss states that erotic calendars for 'women, as for men'
The "Tuss" magazine is working with photographer David Bellmer to release a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli 1970.
But instead of nude celebrities, they're going to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
President Tuss Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to go back to showing an eternal and classic naked figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman's body," said Shaw in a press release announcing a calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
The models can serve on-line or in-person on open casting in Los Angeles and New York.
Moskvik will be given a memo about unscrupulous Internet shops.
In Moscow, we're going to issue a memo that will tell you how not to be a victim of an Internet store.
It was reported in Rosuzaadzor, and it is written by M24.
It is reported that the department & apos; s specialists are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the Internet store correctly and to identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and legislation, rules of delivery, ways of protecting their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make a claim and so on, "reported in Rosuzaadzor.
The memory is currently being finalized.
It will then be posted on the Rosuzuznadzor website for Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and to distribute the Moskvik.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation issued a statement giving the name of the second suspect in the organization of a disversion in Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
These include Panov Yevgeny Alexandrovich and Zachtei Andrei Romanović.
"They all give a confession," it says.
Previously, a resident of the Zaporizki region of Yevgeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing a terrorist attack in Crimea, had pleaded guilty to the interrogation.
The FAS is fined Google for 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FÁS) has imposed an administrative fine on the Google Corporation of 438 million rubles, and is available on the agency's website.
"Google's penalty for breach of the competition law was US $438 million.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay a fine soon, "said the Deputy Head of the FAS, Alexei Docenko.
In the course of the investigation, the FÁS found that Google provided that the manufacturers of smartphones, which are sold on Russian territory, had a Google Play application store only provided that other applications of the corporation were installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine to be placed on the main smartphone screen.
The corporation thus violates article 10 (1) of the FZ on the protection of competition (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law on the Protection of Competition must be respected by all companies whose products are being delivered to the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, including, "noted by the Chief of the Communications and Information Technology Administration of the Federal Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zayev.
The department suspects a conspiracy between 16 Russian shops.
The new book network was fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The "New Book" store network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's "50 days before my suicide," reports to the city news agency "Moscow."
As reported in Roszuznadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be considered "to provoke or motivate the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents."
The Ostankin District Court confirmed that there had been a violation of the requirements for the distribution of information products to children and had decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of printed material arrested by the Rosuzuznadzor.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was the work of Stace Kramer.
In March this year, it was reported that the major bookstores in Moscow are being tested for having a book entitled "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow, it will be the night of the memory of Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, it will be the night of the memory of the sculptor Ernst of the Unknown, reporting to TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central House of Literators.
Unfortunately, not everyone can say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States.
It was therefore decided to organize this evening for those who wanted to mention it on their own land, "said in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
They said it was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends all over the world.
The evening was attended by close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Yevgeny Yitushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the Pushkin Irina Antonov GMII, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as by the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Mizovsky, Head of the Department of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Petanikov.
It was previously reported that Ernst Unknown's relatives were planning to have a sculpture panihid in New York, allegedly before 14 August.
The end-user of the wine: who actually buys the records?
Single middle-aged men like wine.
And until you have failed to divulge the section of the comments with gross insults under the pseudonym of NOTOOdinokia, Mean-Mean-Let, this claim is based on the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussion about the recovery of the plastic is due not to a boom among a generation of 2,000 who want to penetrate a new material object, but to a nostalgia of medium years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering amateurs - it has an emotional importance: older buyers of vinyl are slightly more likely to keep their feelings (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy loneliness (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But are the results of YouTube correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the middle of a vibrant Soho street, in a modest gray suit and a bizarre gestures before the stop, setting up hands and saying something impressive like, "Okay, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt - hotels, cafes, PaperSmart stores are now full of buildings once occupied by independent sellers - several music shops with fantastic professionals are still available.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional mood through surveillance.
Glazgo Stewart, age 55, followed by me from Sister Ray (counting: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years of age), London for half a day to meet, and goes shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, shown above (he sent me a picture by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), walk by lines on the walls of his living room.
Its reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they first came out and buy items that he sold when he was young and on slack.
"A lot of what I'm getting is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the' 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely inthroverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25-year-old who works for Sister Ray, also thinks that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouTube profile.
He noted, however, a new wave of people under the influence of media noise, people who heard about their return and felt obliged to buy their old records.
From the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually in about 1998 or 1999.
The clients who once sold their vinyl to buy a CD-ROM are now selling their CD-ROM to buy their records, "he says.
This could explain the boom among the rebirth of a certain age of vinyl.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plastic?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that plastic stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some of the older clients are, inter alia, offended by the uncollectible pay system.
Some vinyl-loving people can feel a shock from the digital world and prefer to go away into the constant of familiar envelopes for plastic, objects that awakened the memory of an unruly young man.
"I think that sometimes it could be filling in a void or having material things as a kind of complacency," said Wes.
Since I'm a collector, I have it, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plastic stellar.
An ICM survey in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously confused by straining the stelage with the Bosanov collections.
The "trophy" aspect of recovery is what Johnny, 42, who works for the Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone just came in and said," I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a record of Radiohead so we can put a shelf in, "he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely does.
It's more of a bully, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger, not older, they're a little less than 20 people who just get to know it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the whole floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less unforced than in the above-mentioned shops - the last single and sexy pop Wild Coast rather than jazz improv - is a good thing to see diversity in their clients.
None of them seem particularly alone, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, was on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on the market.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much, she says, so it's not a good option to collect records.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of the blame is... "it's falling into dreams with a breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really impossible.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl amateurs: urban mumblers.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at jeans, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cell every minute before his father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
The left side is a staircase, the wall of which is stared with the records of Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winhouse and Flitwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one's looking - perhaps because they're just an ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "art vinyl."
But, given that any focus on these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few clients to the Soho deep for a while, there is little to complain about.
It is no wonder that a population that is more likely than most people to have more time and money than most people do is the one that spends most of the money on luxury goods, such as vinyl.
But while my findings indicate that the YouTube results are accurate, at least in Soho's plastic stores, they do not rule out the vast number of women collecting and loving vinyl that exist in reality, in plastic stores and in online forums.
These people are probably working at school or offices.
But they clearly don't spend the morning of Thursday, walking through the plastic stores on Berwick Street, spilling out the records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake leader who's hanging nothing over his shoulders for middle-aged men.
The Greenland polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal, a video report.
Scientists claim that the Greenlandic polar shark has the greatest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying these sharks, claims that the record gave the female a age of 272 to 512 years and a length of five meters.
The French court rejects the offer to demolish the stores in the Jungley refugee camp.
The French Court rejected the proposal of the Kale authorities to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the trial this week, the Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to demolish a total of 72 improvised shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy beverages, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40 p) or simple dishes for a few euros in improvised restaurants.
The Kale prefect stated that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and health risks.
Humanitarian groups told the Court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free food offered by the Government Association and other groups did not provide sufficient food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They said that makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those who needed it.
The Lille Court held that there was no legal reason to expel the people who run the 72 improvised shops, but stated that the problems of the Kale prefecture were "fully understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the role of the ballet, cafes and restaurants was much more important than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the space had provided a safe meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was at risk of demolition was the Children's Café of the Book of Jungle at the camp, which is not working for profit and offers 200 meals per day, English and French language classes and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not more than eight years old."
Two charitable institutions, assistance to the Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungley camp had increased to over 9,000, the highest in history, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The microarea libraries invite young free people to study programmes.
This week, the subsidiary libraries will hold meetings on the City Day, the Year of Russian Film and even the Day of Physical Education.
The programmes are targeted at children, so most of them will be in play.
Today, August 10, the subsidiary library No. 2, in a backline neighbourhood, is inviting a cruise presentation on "The City of My Little."
On August 11, a regional hour will be held at the subsidiary library No. 1, "I live in this city, I know this city."
There will be a multimedia lesson on the same day, "The Earth is a past destiny," at the subsidiary library No. 2.
And at the Subdivision Library No. 4 in Surazewka, it's a game program called "The Film, The Film, The Film."
On Sunday, 14 August, for the boys from the northern neighbourhood, the subsidiary library No. 3 will play "Fizcult-hello."
Britain stops on silver in Rugby-7 after a Fiji master class allows them to take gold.
The impressive British series in Rugby 7 was staggering at the final obstruction by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night, when they were completely released 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has been given a master class in the ownership of the ball, the decay, the evasive, the support of the game, the running of lines and the gross power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The attack came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver - the third in Britain in the day - and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Rugby 7 Olympic tournament, which was won by New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
The sick beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier that day, could have come back to have a negative impact on them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji has won as much as a team of 15 people as possible.
It may be some comfort for Britain - but probably not - that at least one British will hang a gold medal on the neck tomorrow: the Chief Coach of Fiji, Ben Ryan, former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a certain trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they only lost one.
These strikes will cause pain, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started great, for fun, by taking Britain's attempt to intercept the ball.
It was like hitting a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osei Colinisau jumped into a corner.
With four minutes on Jerrir Tuwai's watch, he added another tachdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to intercept Mitchell has kept the man-Mount Leon Nakarov from hitting the third one, but it has only delayed Fiji.
On the seventh minute, Jas Weremalua made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption, and there was still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and took a line to get a point.
Implementation led to 29-0 in a break.
It looked like Fiji was born for a rugby-7 game, while Britain is still in the mastery of the craft.
Which is, to a large extent, it is.
The UK made a massive half-game replacement, and they bought a Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which was good for the first half before Joshua Tuisov went through a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for the United Kingdom by making a tachdown in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game was long on the way to the South Sea islanders whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the poles.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji & apos; s full joy.
Mata William has been decorated by a Fijian cake that did not need to be decorated by another attempt in the last few seconds.
There was a whistle, Fijians hugged, and Britain fell into a lawn completely defeated.
Previously on the same day, Fiji won Japan from 20 to 5 in its semi-final, and the United Kingdom slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense half-end of one attempt for everyone - the difference between British implementation.
Kyle Brown is taking the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work on his feet, broke the line and put it under his legs in the second half.
The most recent attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother of 15, to the team of England, Anthony, was a victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the fight of the coach against cancer.
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy increases in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional value of their golden moment on Eocio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who were pulling the weight, there were three votes in this boat, and Coach Robin Williams's echo was always there while they were looking for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach such a high.
Their superiority was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated statement, once again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes moving on the surface with the elegance of the swan don't fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
After each gold gobble, a battalion of ready hands, contributing to the gradually increasing victories, which are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see this day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your species a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky to have been able to start treatment in the early 2014 season, while keeping the schedule to a minimum if it could be the right expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking around the department, 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet a time, even though they were talking a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The ridge is on its own a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the artillery regiment with the service in Afghanistan behind my shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe a little too much, but that means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin, too.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I could also ask for a better partner to practice or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a race in five years.
This couple is setting a heavy rhythm that their competitors could never meet.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were in a big phase.
Helen called: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
It's very important not to get involved right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We were not waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to be able to get out and win this race, which we did.
A couple will take a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at her wedding next month, on her own, with her own TV-based adventure-looking Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better, "she said.
The Government has extended the destruction of the sanctions products.
The Government extended to the end of 2017 the destruction of products prohibited from entering Russia.
The order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was imposed in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended on several occasions and is now in force until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were banned.
The elimination of food that has been brought into the country beyond the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were removed from sale.
A "no-go" hunt.
The rains and thunder are expected in Moscow on Friday.
There will be an atmospheric front through the capital region that will bring precipitation and reduce air temperature.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees of heat by day.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short-term rain, possible storm and wind waves up to 15 m / s.
It is expected to rain in the day with storm and wind waves up to 12-17 m / s.
The storm rains are also projected in the Orlovsky, Kursk and Voronezh regions and are reported by Dnieru.
In the next working week, precipitation is unlikely.
The WTO Panel of Arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation," a communication is made on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "comprehensive."
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is mentioned in a communication from the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which had imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is mentioned in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, Financial Times wrote that the US's behaviour in dealing with contentious issues in the WTO undermined the organization's principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the refusal of Americans to approve for a second term South Korean Judge Jang Song Hwa.
Therefore, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's office has been replaced by a head of staff.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vajno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin carried out a restructuring of the President & apos; s administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vainno stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that President Ivanov had begun as head of the administration to be important and pledged to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, "News" had written that the experts considered the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of administration to be transparent and understandable, and that there would be no fundamental change in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who served in the office of the President for a long time, has effectively established the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Vaino, who is a man who is well aware of the specific nature of this work.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that, after a few years, the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may not be attractive to it because of the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Boguslaw Magetz.
His words are transmitted to TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all, we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be the East, the raw materials from the LNG terminals and Norway, "said the Magetz.
Gazprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30% above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
It will be recalled that on 22 July, the Polish competition agency did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the North Flow-2 gas pipeline.
However, a month earlier, Poland had left a request for Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas to North Flow-2.
This was said by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Board of Holding.
The North Flow-2 auction will take place in 2017, and an auction is planned for the fall of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom was not yet planning to take any action on the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, as stated by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Board.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased by 42 per cent the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
Zappreu Gazprom added that the very fact that a Polish PGNIG application had been filed with the Stockholm Court of Arbitration did not yet mean that the negotiations had been terminated.
The Polish company had previously applied to the courts to bring about a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
It is recalled that the Government of Poland's Gas and Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Peter Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Government of Poland & apos; s Gas and Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could, after six years, abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new liquefied natural gas terminal, Baltic Pipe, which would link the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The North Flow-2 provides for the construction of two seagoing lines of a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the Baltic Sea floor.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SPM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hoog, the first Chief of the AGC in Ukraine.
"I can confirm that the MMP has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, in response to a question from journalists, is transmitting RIA News.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there are no security incidents.
The observers monitored developments at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a passenger Yak-42 aircraft landing at Ufa airport was available on the Network, which went beyond the airstrip by 400 metres and fell on the left wing.
The video published the 360 television channel.
The emergency took place at 4.30 in Moscow.
The flight of the Krasnovia airline came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
The Ufa airport is operating in normal mode.
The UCR & apos; s Central Investigation Office has been working on the reason for the hard landing of the liner aircraft.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict denied the use of chlorine, but the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considered that what had happened was undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, to be launched at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have initiated an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, allegedly chlorine, was provided on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that, in an area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft had dropped the poisonous bomb, but in Moscow the charges had been described as an injection.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group "Nature Nur Al-Din Al-Zinki" of the event.
It soon became known that there were two toxic-gas bombs.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, started to burn my eyes, became hard to breathe," quotes the publication of an eyewitness's word.
At least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized as a result of the attack.
If the use of the poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said to journalists: "There is a lot of evidence that this has indeed happened."
The Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC) provides for the inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes.
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders had reported 35 cases of chlorine by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition."
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the daily shelling of its areas and by the terrorists preventing the people from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour silence in the organization is considered "insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped."
The Humanitarian Adviser, Jan Egeland, Staffan de Mistura, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver assistance and to evacuate the sick and wounded from the city every week.
"We have to send bulk cargo from colon trucks in a area where the roads have been virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined," Mr. Egeland said. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations are continuing in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause."
As Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing fight over Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will be operational every day from Thursday.
The establishment of "humanitarian windows" is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essential supplies to the city.
The decision of the Russian Ministry of Defence was taken against the backdrop of the growing international pressure on Moscow to withdraw the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiating process.
Four people were killed in a series of explosions in Thailand & apos; s resorts.
A few explosions were immediately soaked in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people and injured 19.
The launch of the explosions took place in the city of Hua-Hin.
Ten of the victims were foreigners, four were nationals, and none were Russians.
None of the terrorist groups have so far taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has hastened to say that the Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of having organized the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phuket area and the towns of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Thani.
After the military junta took office in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few development industries.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, and Police Colonel Crisan Patanararoen has reported.
He had yet to speak of the objectives, but in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, he was "certain that they were not linked to international extremist groups."
It's too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanararoen said.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, but are in fact local disversions, and we are trying to identify those who were behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the defence of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the police general Sithikiya Shripacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely at a distance of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees on crowded streets filled with restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identity of the remaining victims is not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four of them are German, three are Dutch, two are Italian and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, reported to the Rosturism press service.
Local experts also link the explosions to a referendum on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Votes had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in the election of the country's Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
It will be recalled that a military coup took place in Thailand on 22 May 2014 under the leadership of the Commander of the Army of the country, Prayut Chan-Och.
He said that the army had been pushed by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military had established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, disenfranchised protesters and the upper house of Parliament.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, led by Premier Yinglak Chinawat, announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
It's like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions took place in the centre of Bangkok at the victory monument, where one of the main protests took place, affecting 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and have engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions has begun in the Dry Loga.
As "I" has come to be known, the Government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of an auction for the gold mine by the Dry Log, with two key restrictions.
It is proposed that companies with 25 per cent or more foreign ownership be excluded from auction and those with a minimum of 25 per cent capital.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature submitted to the Government a draft regulation and the terms of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, the Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources, 130 million ounces), and presented two sources of "me" familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, and one of them is specified.
In the Ministry of Nature, we confirmed "I" that the project was submitted to the government.
Vice-Premier Alexander Chlopanin, a member of the office, said "I" that the project had not yet entered the office of the official.
"The auction may be announced in August, as soon as the Government has issued its order, and given the time frame for the collection of applications by potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may be held in October," they are said in the Ministry of Nature.
According to "I," the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version, which was sent for agreement to the ministries and the FISAs in July (with "I").
The first is the availability of at least 25 per cent of the State & apos; s total in the capital of the applicants.
The second is the denial of access to auctions for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles listed in the draft articles, as already written "I" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual nationality may not be allowed to be auctioned.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log is a federal subsoil (more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Environment confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies," but refused to comment on the details before the Government's order.
The requirement for public administration in the capital of the participants in the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, spoke "I" in the Ministry of Nature in December 2015 and confirmed later the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry by his predecessor, Sergei Eroshchenko, "who had" had an agreement on investment projects with Rosteh. "
Who lobbied for the alien's admission, the "I" interviewees do not specify.
"But it is in the spirit of time: not to give control to the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," the interviewer "I" who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, on 1 August, stated that foreigners "may go to a consortium" if the applicants involve them "as a financial entity, as a technological partner."
The "I" interviewees think it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main candidate for the Dry Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miners of the Russian Federation, PAO "Polus," under the control of the son of Suleiman Kerimov Saidu and "Rosteh."
As I wrote, in July, the partners created a SPC "Soloto," where Polus has 51% shares, and Rosteh has 49%.
In Rostech, they rejected comments, and in Pole they said "I" that "I am certainly interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competence and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the terms have been announced," added in "Pole."
ALROSA may be involved in the auction, but the decision by the Russian government was "I."
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kincross, which are developing assets on Chukotka, have declared the possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "I," are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Russian Union of Gold Industrialists, Sergei Kashuba, assessed "I" as an investment in the Dry Log of $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are not only deterred by the level of investment but also by the complexity of the project: there is a need for a serious search of stocks and technologies for dealing with complex ores, explaining the "I" interviewees in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M & A transaction, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, started a process of merging the four NFP-controlled.
As a result, the "Pension Savings Fund" will establish a NPF with savings of about $373 billion.
The launch of the procedure for the integration of four pension funds - KIT Finance, PromagroFund, Heritage and the Gas Fund for Pension Savings - was reported yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of the KIT Finance Pension Administrator funds.
"The reorganization shall be carried out in consultation with the ECB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the existing contracts be not impaired," as stated in the company's communication.
The association is based on the "Pension Savings Fund."
As noted by the Director-General of this NPF, Oleg Bjaloshitsky, the consolidation of funds has achieved several objectives: increasing the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative date for completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the consolidation of the NPF, the "Pension Savings Fund" will be the largest player in the PCO market.
As at 31 March, the pension savings of the pooled funds amounted to more than $373 billion.
According to the accounts on the Fund's website, the beneficiaries of the Fund's owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (65 per cent owned by the DEA) and the Gas Fund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched a much later competition.
For example, the O1 of the NPF's "Future" monitoring group had absorbed the StalFund as early as this year.
The joint NPF is currently adding the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
"Integration into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to meet structural challenges," the Director-General of the NPF, "The Future," Nikolai Sidorov, notes.
Since April, active efforts have also been made to consolidate funds in the "Safmar" pension group - the "European" NPF, "" Education and Science "and" Regional Fund "- to be integrated into the" Safmar "NPF until the end of the year.
In 2017, the NPF Trust will join them.
"The consolidation of funds will have an impact on increased control over risks, operational processes and expenditures," noted in the "Safmar" pension group.
The fund consolidation that KIT Finance Pension Administrator has adopted may be set aside by experts for several reasons.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds in which the group was active.
Following the amendments to the CBM Regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought out by one major player, "as indicated by the Director of the ACRA Financial Institutions Rating Group, Yuri Nogin.
Several of the NFP top-15 asset leaders are another possible reason for the pause, calling the division of power and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund to be agreed upon by the group's owners.
Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment yesterday.
The request for "me" to the "Gazfund" NPF was also not answered.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and weekly exercise, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As noted by the Director-General of the consulting company, "The Pension Partner," Sergei Okolesnov, "the Gas Fund for Pension Savings," the accession will help to stabilize the base of the other funds of the group.
In doing so, the more successful experience of KIT Finance and the PromagroFund in the construction of retailers of UPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be sought.
The requirements of the CBs for NPF processes and cadres are growing steadily, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, as the Managing Director of Corporate RA Expert, Pavel Mitrovica, considers.
"The effect of reducing duplicative functions will clearly outweigh the possible costs of integration," Mr. Mitrovica notes.
The cost of merging the four funds is estimated at between 30 million and 50 million roubles.
"The cost of maintaining four such funds is about 400 million rubles per year, with the budget being effectively halved in the medium term," I am sure Mr. Okolonov.
The Russian film, "Pete and his dragon," was a good one.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the exquisite dragon, the spiritual history and country-style songs, are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again.
A scared little baby picked up a dragon that became a human child and a gentle babysitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy from a story book, plays a game with him and falls asleep.
Six years later, he is no longer distinguished from the other intelligent forest-swan, Maugley.
In this way, Pita finds a red-haired female jeger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the Gavin Brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressive in the forest.
Now she's not only gonna have to believe in the dragon, but she's gonna have to help save it.
Pete is on an accelerated course of "being human" in an environment of stupid Americans who wear cowboy shirts, moral code in the heart, and smile more blindly than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too bad for the audience to really hate or be afraid.
Even Gavin, who has discovered the hunt for an untypical forest under his control, is far from an unremediable villain.
A huge, fuzzy dragon, too, was not scary, with the good face of the bulldog, the airliner wing, and the ability to be invisible.
The dragon is funny, smiles, even mumbles, and, luckily, he doesn't say, but he always wants to be greeted, which is a good difference from all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his way of keeping up is so high in emotional engagement that, at the most tense moments, it is becoming desperate to cry into three streams not only of small viewers but also of adults.
A very good little Ox Figley as Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is virtuously giving out a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How was David Lowry's director able to make a fantastic, nice replay of the 1977 Disney film "The Dragon Pita," mediated from the nose to the end of the tail, and remembered only by a mix of animation and a game movie, and make it the most spiritual film of this summer?
It's as good as a miracle.
In fact, Lowry's original picture took only two things: an orphan of Pete and a dragon.
There are music numbers and most of the weird jokes on board.
This good tale reads the features taken from Bambi, the alien, and many other nice children's paintings.
Disney's studio continues to expand the gallery of high-quality remeers of the twenty-first century.
Of course, "Pete and the dragon" is not as stunning as "The Book of the Jungle," and there is no artificial villain as Kate Blanchette as the stepmother in the new "Cinderella."
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle will be given once more by Director Lowry, to make an artistic film adaptation to the story of Peter Pan.
In the "Pita and his dragon," the tangdemome David Lowry and the writer Toby Halbrooks have been included in a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy on the one-name story of James Barry.
The BBC journalist, Alexander Sokolov, will be charged with a new charge.
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing an extremist structure, stated that the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office had found a problem with the defendant & apos; s case.
The fact that the Public Prosecutor's Office made this presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the limitation of the knowledge of the criminal case, but the meeting was not held, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office, "the BBC refers to the words of Olga Dinze's lawyer.
She said that the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office had indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the material collected were not consistent.
The investigators will now have to address the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze will specify.
As reported by "I", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from prosecution a RBC journalist from the wording of "dissipating the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing power by illegal means."
The correspondent, "Commercial Boscosport," ALEXANDR SILBERT, lived as an Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch at the local dining room and even passed the WADA test.
I don't think life here is dying for a second.
Even at night.
The last start sometimes ends at midnight, after which it takes athletes an hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village is being carried out without a stop, as some athletes have completed their statements and left Brazil and, on the contrary, some only come here.
As of 7: 30 in the morning, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are drawn into one of the temporary shadows.
In these meetings, we usually discuss some kind of operational domestic issues, "the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov." Despite the fact that the house in which our own house is located, consider it a model - it was put into operation as one of the first and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it there are some problems.
The hot water is a problem, and I'm sorry, the toilet.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cliners came, but they just put some kind of substance on the floor, that's all.
The fields are, you see, some kind of innovative.
Mol, you can't wash them in human terms.
We know these floors are a common laminate.
So, we got a change in the clinical company, and now it's all OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side of the mountains, and on the other, an impressive rag, and a place of water.
And for safety, there is a two-metre iron fence all over the perimeter, along which the machine-mats walk.
A total of up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in the village in 3604 units located in 31 houses.
One of the 18-storey buildings has a huge Russian flag - this house is fully placed in the needs of our team.
After looking at a small background at the entrance, it is possible to immediately determine which problems may be most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the registration counter: a print "Please don't throw paper into the bathroom!" and from the hand of "Take a badge.
The stand itself is drowning in the booklets.
Their fun colouring contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: "The infectious disease memo for those leaving for Rio de Janeiro," "First aid on drowning, the introduction of an alien body into the respiratory path, the loss of consciousness - the stages of heart and pulmonary resuscitation," "First aid on burns, heat strikes, fractures and haemorrhages."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Inflation is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are expected to have a favourable outcome.
There is, of course, a medical centre in the position of the Russian team, which at any time is ready to provide the people of the house with qualified assistance, including a relaxing and sports massage.
On the contrary, the medical centre is the headquarters of our delegation.
The next door is an inspiring poster, "No matter what, we will win."
And of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Even less of us, the sweetest taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And to raise the spirit even further, there is a declaration: "Dear brothers and sisters!
Under the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Rusi Kirill, the protojeri Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev is given spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order molecules and other coats on the phone...
In general, there is a centre of meditation and religious rites in the village for all faiths.
And the Russians, in a privileged position, have their own chapel.
Because of the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, I stumbled about the bodies on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new clinical company.
I think they're ready to throw themselves at the washing of the innovative floors at any time, so they decided to have a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long-standing friend, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our Batutists, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He's with a young man, a European champion, Jana Pavlov, who has kindly agreed to show his rooms.
It's not a big deal to complain about, it's the impression of Russia's well-deserved coach, and it's two-way, bed-to-bed, of course, almost up-and-back, but it's not critical.
The one on four, but it's open.
The closet is, of course, funny, out of fabric, not credible, but you can put things in.
"No, well, you're faking it, they're out of tea!" "he's giving up the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsov, who I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one, at least because it is a space of 2.7 million square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
It's a total of 60,000 per day for free.
The options for the menu are: "Best of Brazil," "The World's Kitchen," "Asian Pizza," and "Pizza, Macaroni."
The last option, as I've seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And yet, let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
- I'm surprised at Kuznetsov.
It's a good thing I brought a Chinese man with me, a bailout.
And a kettle.
But just so you know, we have worse food on the courts.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a cod for a couple and a meatball in a tomato sauce.
There is a panel with the name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, and the food value of the product and the availability of allergies.
Well, that's good to say, it was edible.
I don't even know why that line is standing at the local McDonald's.
The sons, relaxed, can be said to be "warm" athletes on their way out of the restaurant, waiting for our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
It's a good-for-nothing, a victorine that gets a T-shirt to win.
It's a serpent, you can say!
To get a present, you have to answer at least eight out of ten questions.
There are questions in Russian! - The WADA girl attacked me.
But the wrong one was attacked.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic struggle, of course.
The situation has been aggravated by the second question: "If I have received notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I was on option B, "No, I have one hour."
I've lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that WADA didn't have to wait.
Well, we have to be there right away.
And at the seventh stage of the victorine, my position became very critical.
I thought, for some reason, if I was having trouble meeting a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I'm having a hard time!), I could use bioadditives to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they don't!
In fact, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly, in several proposals.
It's not fair to play WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go behind Efimov, Isinbaev, and all our deformed team.
So I focused, and I won a bad T-shirt out of my last powers.
You know what they say, ours!
In a win-win mood, I went to the gym next door.
I got involved in the rider count.
I fell down to 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian athlete had been found in this raging of the runway.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who can't play be trained!
And here's our guy sitting in a hospital next to you.
In line for the oculist.
Don't worry, don't be a shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the whole village, there is a condom-issuing machine.
There is an encouraging call on him: "Celebrate the condo."
The only way to go is to roll the iron that resembles the door lock, and a condom made from the natural Amazon latex is ready to drop out of the machine.
I took one to remember.
The athletes won't leave, they've been brought in 450,000.
The Olympic village has a whole entertainment centre for its celebration and celebration.
In his case, there is a sign that reminds him that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The centre is flooded by video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices like a video-breaker.
I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team who's actively using a savage toy.
You could, of course, just say you don't want to talk to a man in Russian form, that's all.
By the way, there's a strange set of circumstances in the eyes that are getting away from the guys in the fucking blues.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to go around the whole village by looking at every corner of the village.
But if you walk, not drive a car, you will be opened up with a Canadian team with a lobe at the entrance and a ball with a rebuilt bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry office, and a dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with daily consumption, and a mail with unique stamps (but you can still not move from the Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a search house, and a photo kiosk.
And late in the evening, you will sit by an olive tree, hanged by various colored ribbons, in memory of the friends and relatives of the athletes who have left this world.
And you're gonna be under the computational of a machine that sprays the insect-death fluid indiscriminately, thinking about the eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding his breath, the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Not many people know that Inna Deriglazova won the gold at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm even the only Moskwich who saw it happen - not to mention those who were watching the Caribbean competition that night.
Only a real cheerleader can understand that.
Imagine, the deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors at the bottom - as always by the hour of the night - wake up and start to be harmless, but very loud to yell at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's no time in the kitchen to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
There's nothing on the television schedule, so I just kept the "Match," "First" and, in case of "Russia," it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of the repeat, all the sports is on the record for some reason.
It's live on TV.
Hope, of course, for "The Match," all night, a young man was screaming in the news first about the great half-finals of the Deriglazov-Xanaev, then about the future gold fight.
It would be logical to show you.
But instead, basketball is US-Australia.
I can't say anything bad about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put Americans in their place with their own greatness.
As a result, they have lost, but as is now said, the basketball Olympic tournament will not be the same.
It's all good, but there's a fight with Di Francesca, and there's no change on the screen.
In a light panic, I'm beginning to lose channels.
It's like, for the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep to the cable.
There's no fencing on any of the "Match" themes.
Oh, I feel like the fight is about to start.
I don't like the text and tweet of some sports sites.
A ship's surfing is an unexpected but brilliant result.
The "First" website shows a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
Click for fencing, get a match for gold.
Deriglazov is a great contrast, goes forward on points, and obviously starts to take time.
The Italian girl is playing almost the whole thing.
We're one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francik is throwing himself at Deriglazov, she's retreating, time is over, Italy is making a shot.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first one to see it with his own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (DOM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DOM plenary ordered its imams to carry out Friday sermons only in Tartar to make young Tatars "learn their own language."
The Administration states that this "does not in any way affect" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some of Kazani's mosques, it is said that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The Imam are afraid that their preaching in the Tatar "will not reach the audience."
Yesterday, the plenary of the DOM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday preaching in the mosques of the Republic only in the Tartar language.
As the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, stated, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their own language."
"For those who say it's" hard, "in every big mosque, we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language at no cost at all," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today, in all mosques, "should already be in the Tartar language."
He recalled that the Tatarstan DOM was publishing a magazine called "Shura" with model sermons in the Tartar language.
Imam, who is not good enough to speak Tartar, "can be well prepared for them."
The Tattarstan DOM brings together more than a thousand parishes in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, in the areas, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazani, a number of mosques used the Russian language in the past.
In particular, the Mufti indicated that it had been practised at the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, the leadership is working to ensure that all students have knowledge of both State languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no violation of the non-Tatar Muslims," Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a compulsory, essential part of the prayer."
However, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be maintained in mosques.
At the same time, Rafiq Muhametshin said "I" that there was no serious threat that the Tatar language would be removed from the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, languages such as Uzbek or Tajik are not, according to him, used in the country & apos; s sermons.
The decision of the DCM was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCL).
Rinat Zakirov, the head of the WCL, said, "I am": "Dream is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to leave this area.
He noted that preaching only in the Tartar language was "the wish of the imams themselves," but in the EXCOM, "it was the right thing to do."
Those who have been questioned by the imams who have been preaching in Russian are ready to give effect to the decision of the DLM, but they believe that the parishioners will have difficulties understanding the priests.
Tatar and Russian go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand language.
Of course, it's gonna be a little tight.
"We have to reconstruct," says the Imam of the Burnaev Mosque, Farhat Maleletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer to even many Tatars, as "Russian, both in schools and in kindergartens, on radio, all over the place."
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue the Russian language lessons and lectures held on other days.
We put our trust in God.
God will show you the way out of this. "He has made a conclusion.
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
These are both Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," says imam.
He believes that in the Tartar language, sermons will "reach a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the result of preaching is different.
But time will show.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my mother's," Gabdulla Galyullin concluded.
The former director of FCIN was brought to trial
The Moscow Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office has approved an indictment on a criminal case investigated by the Supreme Court of Justice concerning the embezzlement of the budget allocated to the Russian Federation & apos; s FSIN.
The ex-head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, will be brought before the court for damages of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Central Public Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskwutz District Court against the former Director of the Russian Federation's FCN, Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, and the Director of the FGU, "Centre for Information and Technology and Communication of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences" (FGGP CITOS), Victor Talynov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the SSO of Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of authority with serious consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed using their official position in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and possession of ammunition).
According to the UPC, in 2010-2012, these persons have been fraudulent in stealing from the State budget the budget allocated to the FCN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for persons under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budget money, the group developed a scheme under which the TCETOS, under its control, with which the State contracts were entered into, produced technical controls and supervision, including "electronic bracelets," and sold on a multiple-time basis.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings and facilities for the installation of production facilities that would allow for the establishment of a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets," five State contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between the Government of Russia and the Russian Federation.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were found in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FGGP, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
It is believed that more than 140 million roubles of cash have been personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the co-participants, for which a criminal case has been assigned to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the fraud, was found to have an unknown origin of the ammunition for the decoration gun, which allowed him to be further charged.
In this case, which has a volume of 133 volumes, the accused are charged with a claim for compensation in the amount of Rs. 2.7 billion.
The Futhbolist Hakan Shukur is suspected of being involved in the course.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two of his family's homes.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s - the early 2000's - the attacker Hakan Shukur is being sought by the authorities in connection with the attempted coup d & apos; état last month.
He was accused of being a member of an "armed terrorist group" after a sports career in 2008.
This is the Hizmet movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition, Fethullah Gülin.
It is his President Erdogan who considers the attempted military coup on 15 July to be the convener.
Fethullah Gülin lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur had been issued today, and the police had already carried out searches of two homes belonging to the former football player's family.
According to the investigation, his father, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, was part of Fethullah Gülin's organization.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and advocated for a collective country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasarai.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino," "Inter" and "Palermo," as well as English "Blackburn."
He didn't spend more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur is still the most successful attack team in Turkey, with 112 national team matches and 51 hit-and-run games.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post as a result of an ongoing corruption investigation around Erdoğan and his immediate environment.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of having links with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media officers can wait for long prison terms, ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Yegor Conchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for national films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian movies, which were worth two or three times less than those of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Conchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for the audience with large Hollywood ribbons.
We have more than 100 paintings per year in our country, of which the average is 20-25 tape.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, which are being promoted by huge budgets," said the film director.
On 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum "Tavreda" began its work in Crimea.
The participants include teachers of creative skills and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of the foreign and foreign countries.
The British won Olympic gold in an academic double.
The British Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won the Olympic gold in an academic double.
The silver was taken by the New Zealanders Rebecca Sloan and Genevieve Beren, and was ranked third by Anne Anderson and Hedwig Rasmussen from Denmark.
I-News - The new gencontractor promises to give up the Zenith-Arenu by 26 December.
The new master of the St. Petersburg Stadium, who is to host the Confederate Cup 2017 and the World Cup of 2018, Metrostru promises to rent by 26 December, reports to RIA News, with reference to the head of the interim commission of the Federation Council for the World Cup 2018, Wadim Tulpanov.
"Today, we, together with the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Muthko, visited the building, with us was the CEO of" Metrosystem "Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd be giving up the stadium by 26 December.
It's a serious Petroburg company, it's never time-bound.
Vitalia Muthko and I have remained satisfied with what we saw and heard, "quote the agency of the interviewee.
Previously, Vitaly Muthko arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the venue of the upcoming large-scale competition.
Mr. Tülpanov also noted that his Commission of Soufeda would continue to monitor the progress of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction.
It will be recalled that yesterday it was known that Metrostru would complete the construction of Zenit-Arena, that the contract would cost about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company had won the bid for the improvement of the area around the stadium, the contract value was 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with the AO Transforma Corporation, the OO Transru-Spab Engineering Corporation and the AO Transforma Engineering Corporation were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the stadium.
For more information on the choice of a new CEO, read in "I" "" Metrostrus "was released on the field."
In Miassa (Chelyabin region), a lawyer of former Vice-Governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulic was detained.
According to "I-South Ural," another lawyer of the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, Constantine Akulica, was called to the investigation department of the UCR of Miassa today to charge a one-year-old case of beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulic was on his way to the scene as a lawyer for the assistance of one of his participants.
"It was originally initiated against unidentified persons." Now that he has begun to protect Nikolai Sandakov, it turns out that it was Akulic, "he considers Sergei Kolosovsky.
Constantine Akulic became an ex-Deputy Governor's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer was called to the UPC, Miassa was informed by the defence that the fraud case against Nikolai Sandakov was due to expire on Monday.

The Russian Medical Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and give more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has undertaken to modernize one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country, the Karabakh Mededplum Complex.
The Karabakh Medplum Plant was founded by an English equity society led by Leslie Urkart in 1910.
During the Soviet period, this was an industrial enterprise of importance to the country & apos; s economy, and it actually ensured the life of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh Medeplasm Complex.
One of the main problems of the Karabakh plant, the environmental one, had to be addressed.
By the early 2000's, Karabakh had already been infamous as an environmental disaster.
The situation in Karashmedi began to change in 2004, after the business had become a management of the Russian Medical Company.
The company began to upgrade its production, gradually reducing environmental burden.
This was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelyabin region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the first numbers of July, "Karabakh."
The head of the South Urala said that the changes that had taken place with the company since the Karashmeda had become a RMC group.
The main effort to modernize the "Karashmedi" of recent years has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid chain that can capture up to 99.9 per cent of the metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Medical Company, Vsevolod Levin, the investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the Karashmet ZAO is the reconstruction of the converters.
The replacement of the three converters, the dust and the gas track is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion roubles of industrial waste-water treatment is planned to be launched at the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes on the budget of the city of Karabakh will also increase.
In the entire period of the Tomina Goca project, from the beginning of construction until the entry into force of Release 2, the Federal Treasury will receive US $8.9 billion.
Once the GCA has been put into operation, taxes on all levels may amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
In the year of production in the Varnen region, 346.3 million roubles have been allocated to various levels.
And that's the first year.
"The longer the business works, the more the amount of the contribution may be," Valery Ulanovsky added.
In the RMC, it was specified that in 2015 tax contributions from the Miheevsky Gauca were close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of their areas of presence is not limited to tax contributions.
RMC enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the area.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Medical Company in Karabakh was the major renovation and, in fact, the almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten into 95.
The building, which was built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
A landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and ground-based parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops will also be located on the territory of the RMC of the Arena.
The RMC of Arena will make it possible to carry out visionary professional sports activities at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the inhabitants of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

WSJ: The US is considering sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the entry of Democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the Democratic Party's break-in, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
It is reported that, in order to impose sanctions, President Barack Obama's administration will have to formally charge an attack on Russia's servers or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other American special services are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to mention those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is a 2014 break-in of Sony Entertainment Pictures, for which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree to facilitate the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or assist the Cybermen.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries as well.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be long, writing a publication.
Even if officials had concluded that hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding on disclosure.
They will have to determine whether the incident is so serious as to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama administration allowed sanctions to be imposed on a State whose hackers had hacked into the Democratic Party National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks published an e-mail from the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the break-in.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
The FAS fined Google for almost half a billion roubles.
The reason was the lack of competition in the mobile application market.
The Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided the smartphones producers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the installation of applications from other developers, such as Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company had abused the dominant position on the market and imposed on the manufacturers of mobile devices, together with Google Play's other applications.
Following a review, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google and informed the CEO of the FAS, Alexi Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FÁS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, should comply with the competition protection law.
In turn, Google intends to examine the decision first and then determine with further action: to do it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted before 18 December.
However, Google did not agree.
Since then, the company and the agency have been engaged in judicial proceedings.
The FÁS noted that, despite a fine, the possibility of a peace agreement was being discussed with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This view was expressed by the leading analyst, Mobile Research Group, Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

This is the highest rate in the years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2 per cent was shown.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015-July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014-July 2015) was -0.8 per cent.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 per cent, which is a monthly inflation rate of 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 per cent, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2 per cent compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, compared with the previous month, the increase was recorded in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 per cent); transport (1.8 per cent); recreation and culture (6.3 per cent); restaurants and hotels (1.2 per cent); other goods and services (0.3 per cent).
Clothing and footwear prices have decreased (2.2 per cent); furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5 per cent); and health (0.1 per cent).
The prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcohol and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication systems; and education.
The "Anime" effect of Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon on.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some of the observers say it's racially insensitive.
Through the "Linza" tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and to play with identity in ways that border the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character into a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lenses are a rough, curative tool that creates more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly becoming known to the public.
The lenses of Snapchat were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of a person or encouraging whites as an ideal of beauty.
So, when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them sour eyes, screams, and sour cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon of Asian "yellow-face."
And they asked whether these repeated contradictions point to the company's more serious diversity problem.
On Wednesday, messages and the subsequent indignation in the reports on The Verge and Motorboard were distributed, the day after Snapchat announced that they had removed this function.
The company commented that the lens was designed as a tribute to anime characters, not as a cartoon for Asian characters.
But experts who know about racism are not necessary, the lens has been a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an e-mail from Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Twitter on photographs was actively shared, said that the lens was "offensive and at least awkward."
She added that "it is hard to argue with a comparison between the side of a very rough cartoon on and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, but highly dementia yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the devils we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat - who are more racial than their older generation - can mean that they are more likely to be able to be understood.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Ju, "such a course of events is much more difficult to see, as it was before."
On Thursday, Gu, a product manager and an engineer who works for the Medium, decided to remove his record from Snapchat and called on others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were a cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snipchat.
Ju was criticized by the predominantly white management of the company, which was made up of men only, and completed his article with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
As Ju, who is a Chinese-American himself, wrote: "Either they have a sufficient number of skies in the state to make such decisions or they have a non-American, but they do not hold positions in which to speak in a safe and open manner."
Other observers share her view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, stressing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but, according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented sectors of the population and to actively try to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Ju said that she would keep her record on Snapchat closed, adding, "I'm wondering if they really need more users like us to tell them that they won't."
The military leadership has distorted intelligence about ISIL, reported to the Congress Commission
The United States Central Command officials have changed intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than was the case on the ground, and have reported to the Congress Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational team established by the Republican Presidents of the Committee of the House of Representatives for the Family, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found "widespread discontent" among the Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who claim that the leaders were directing their assessments of the American actions aimed at winning the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the Centre, is the main military authority in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the High Command of the Centre have generally provided a more optimistic picture of the US's anti-terrorist activities than the real data from the scene and have been consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services," referred to in the report.
"What happened at the Centre is unacceptable: when the top management seems to be misjudged, our military is suffering," said a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems at the Centre are at the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the shortcomings that have been constantly encountered in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of United States activities aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
While he does not have final evidence that the Obama administration officials ordered the falsification of the reports, he claims that the analysts felt that the Centre's management had forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events," reported in the report.
For example, a Central official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is known for sure," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest management of the United States Central Command Intelligence Service forged command intelligence documents to reduce the threat from ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established a task force when they learned that the analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, pending investigation into the Centre & apos; s intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the Centre established an excessively closed procedure for conducting intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and Iraq's security forces," said in a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Shiff, the main representative of the democratic party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, "stalled the issuance of intelligence documents," damaged the morale of analysts and "does not sufficiently reflect divergent views."
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to force the analysts of the Centre to place their findings under "intended or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the investigation into the Congress were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, which was opened following complaints by the Centre's analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the investigation of the Chief Inspector was ongoing.
But he said that "the experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of the integrated data, and the Special Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the United States bombing in Iraq and Syria (as is now being claimed by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence) is achieving its objectives.
But last year's statements raise questions as to whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State renews the disputes that took place more than a decade ago, when the intelligence analyst of the Centre Gregory Huker wrote a research article alleging that the administration of President George Walker Bush, owing to the protests of many analysts, had supported a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on the Islamic State-owned oil refineries did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Commander of Cenkoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many members considered to be an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four consecutive times in a female hockey on the grass, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain.
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended with a 6-1 victory over Japan, Cathy Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for a US team of women's hockey on the grass, when the Americans won the 3-0 team of India.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who's tracking his goals.
This is what she knows: the 4-0 American account at the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains undefeated after Japan's loss of 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim a quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take their first place in a group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong rival team from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little weather when the quarterfinals begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made noise in their unexpected series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London Games.
Pam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time taking a hockey club on the grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters were playing this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not go on a selection tour for the final.
It was then 2012, when it was not good for her and her team.
The following year, Koyeg Parnham, an English, was appointed as a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the same productivity as we do now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an inconvenient hand at a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team found itself surprisingly hard and kept the 1-0 account until the end of the third period, when Bam took the lead.
She made a long pass with a ball down the left side of the field, then went in the middle of the spiral and shook the ball into the gate, giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added a final goal in mid-fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first to be held in the United States-owned United States-owned, Jackie Briggs, to miss one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in a hit.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the infinity of the Olympic Games - the "Zen" jump on the Batut.
Wherever you are, whatever time you are, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be constant and inevitable; it is an irresistible combination of competition and desire.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is the burning torch that is transmitted from the beacon to the raft, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbors in turn at the cafe, and not hear about Simon Biles, Cathy Ledeki, or the enmity between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Duli, who first participated in the Olympic Games, is a pretty-looking mist on his cheek, could well be among those celebrities that are shown in the prime time that the sponsors and the life-approving commercials would promote if he were a carpenter, a gymnast, or even a fencing player.
But 28-year-old Duli, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in an Olympic battle to jump on a Batute.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
The following sports are not generally recognized: a pneumatic gun, onion, Badminton, Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak out for my personal self-interest, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of the bats on the Batute.
Although the bats have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many people I have interviewed have not been aware that they are even Olympic.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States had sent athletes to the competition, they had never won a medal on a bow, and their athletes did not go to the end until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share men's awards, while Chinese and Canadians share women's awards.
Don Doon from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the bats have an outsider's charm, especially because for an unenlightened ear, they are more associated with a circus college than the Olympic Games.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, but a ground-based enthusiast.
They do have a comic potential - a caricature melting of permanent jumps - but also a gymnastics and a water jump, two types of sports that they basically combine.
The word "bake" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín," which means "tramplin for jumping into water."
Contestants jump on a giant batutte, which is about 30 feet into the air, and they have to do a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, swings and salto) before they finally land on their feet.
They are evaluated by performance, complexity and "flight time," according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is to go.
Medal applicants must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes towards the end, and sometimes back and forth, up and down the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the start wall, but also, in view of television cameras, the other teasing line: the world or the Olympic record.
This is a persistent desire that is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and enough to make even the audience go blind.
But it's, in my opinion, a little tedious when you look at the game.
He's giving him a break.
The direction of the Batutist is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she pops, seems untouchable, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then without effort, up again.
And they are not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program there is no crazy rust to the finish line, there is no jump in length, only a wild, elegant waste of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women & apos; s qualification competitions, followed by the final, will be held on Friday afternoon, on the hour of the Eastern European time, and the men will be on Saturday, also at the hour.
The NBC will broadcast the final as part of the day programme from 2 p.m. on a daily basis.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in the common dump.
And if an increase in consciousness can only be achieved by giving male athletes a good look at and objective - as the Wall Street Journal has recently suggested by United States men - Duli is only waiting for his new admirable crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators, who require political change in Ethiopia, have faced violent opposition from the Government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-Government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have entered the streets, demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government & apos; s response was cruel.
Witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
The video footage from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were put with their hands to the wall.
The highest United Nations human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the African Horn project in the international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to address terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently referred to government repression - opposition in the territory of the State has been suppressed by the fact that dissidents have been made to silence.
Many of them were expelled, imprisoned, killed or expelled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no other option but to protest, the rebellion will rise," said Seum Tesoma, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the takeover of power by the Government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely exhausted the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is increasing; the struggle over this uncertain, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use unrest and transfer.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings that have been boiling deep down for years are now fading.
The first one seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government is closing access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find a way to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that that was how they were organized to protest.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara, from the predominantly Christian high-mountain regions of Ethiopia, has thrived in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and living in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under one command," said Mulat Gemecha, leader of Oromo.
The major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted a danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly able to recognize the first signs of discontent and to use intelligence to obtain data and disable the opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
In contrast to Meles, who was from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a Southern.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that, as a result, this will lead to even greater bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia had experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people had protested against what the analysts had said seemed to have been elections that the Government had broken down and then forged.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, although in less than the last months, and this period of unrest was relatively rapid.
The development experts expressed their appreciation to Ethiopia & apos; s leaders for the forward-looking development of infrastructure, such as the new inter-urban train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal discontent of the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhar, attacked enterprises belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protesters put the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The United States Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose power in an already fragile region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this tight channel," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that had covered his electoral headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party presidential candidate to address the American people in a reasonable manner.
It also placed his deputies, who were trying to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward situation, because they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
In making that suggestion at the conference on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded ISIL.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just fucking.
The post was the direct opposite of an allegation made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When the radio-conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump ease the speech, reminding him that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican party's presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal was when Trump was trying to redirect his campaign to the economy against a background of lower ratings.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to get back to the subject.
Once again, using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and he said that she had found her speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he had all-out criticism, having practically suggested that the Russians should hack into Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is allowed in a political speech and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that are responding to his fans, watching them act and then" explaining "them to one side or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, the communication expert who analysed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful about his remarks and knows that they are vague enough to be treated differently.
Instead of relaxing the statements for the broad electorate, Trump has taken on an even more sensitive tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump was falling behind Clinton with a large overweight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and was lying to her in Florida.
While Trump is generally trying not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the subject of increased attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they have to support him publicly, however provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputy deputies of Trump, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate for the interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Giuliani, when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton were founded by the Islamic State.
It is true that, before Obama, ISIL was an almost unknown small organization, he called it a non-threat, completely unfair, and that is why it happened because he withdrew from Iraq.
Most of the medium-sized Republicans are confident that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, has allowed ISIL to develop because it has not been able to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for dispelling and prejudicing each of his words.
He mocked "poor, poor" television experts who were trying to figure it out, and he said, "They are weak."
Some Democrats have made fun of Trump's excuses, as an overstatement that he is not a presidential.
A once-out coffee shop is back in Greenpoint.
The "Verb" coffee shop was boned, taking only cash in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was taken out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
The Soop Sheri store, which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in a new city.
The artist Molly Crabple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and" Verb "is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
The reborn "Verb" coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verbe has a Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus, coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodrigues, a long-standing member of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he would be happy to.
Rodrigues, who is 36 years old, has left much in the same form.
Verb is working with the same beagle distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even set up the lusts from the old Verba.
But Rodrigues said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu contains bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and is available for capers or roasted onions.
There's a dish of brown rice.
They don't serve beer in the coffee shop anymore, but now they're making fresh-eyed juice.
Nine months later, Rodrigues said that he had drawn attention to the steady flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former clients have also been awarded a price from Williamsberg," he shared.
In a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and atmosphere that were applying to me at Verba," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although she ordered a bathing tea that day instead of a regular ice coffee, another new new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been visiting Verb since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing.
"15 minutes to 8: 00, every day, like hours, I came, and for me, my bagel was made with oil and all the stuff," he said.
Rodrigues said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making a regular order, but one day he's changing things with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the stuff.
Rodrigues said he was not offended that the soap store had once taken over an old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri offered to make a special soap for Verba, using cold coffee coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their offer," said Rodrigues.
The permanent residents of the Greenpoint of Polish origin have also given up on the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodrigues said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel wanted.
There are other benefits to this new place.
The local point for the sale of juice is planning to spill out bottles and sell cold-made coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite food on the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular client and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Witt said that by coming in and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
"As long as I wanted to feel that scent," he confessed.
Depression-free food in "Pure Trapeze."
In March 1933, shortly after his assumption of the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourman, President Roosevelt loved the fashion of Fifth Avenue, for example, the foie gras and the meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: peeled eggs in tomato sauce, potato peas, and for dessert, the pudding of chunky.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Kow, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
Koa's last book, "Ragu in Chinese," was devoted to Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told a history of life at a living apartment in Lower East Side through food in his book "House 97 on Fract Garden Street."
Their new joint work, "Pure Trapeze," to be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
While showing some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple diner in the Flateiron quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Birghah.
Zigelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with a piece of olive, and Kow, 57, took a turkey, a potato peas, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roulette, the couple considered it a good starting point for discussion on food in the period of Depression.
"The roulette was in great demand," said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roulette, a baked roulette, a bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine you ate as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Cow's got a fuss.
"He must have been in the stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the United States table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women & apos; s groups were preparing for male farm workers, and fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I that described how the country was dealing with what suddenly stopped being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when the food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," Kow said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
It was also difficult to find a new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rots and bakers, became basic food; the baker is "a great way to manage the supplies," Zigelman noted, because the cook could hide the untasteful ingredients under the thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutrition have become more important than taste and even culinary sense.
In research for a book that includes prescriptions, Zigelman has prepared a dish for that era: a baked onion with peanut oil.
"This addition to the lunch table was not successful," Kow said.
Zigelman added, "It was very weird."
The peanut oil is completely out of line with the sand bow.
This has been the case for many home-based prescriptions.
More than ever, domestic workers - including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - managed the country's food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers," to accept the challenge and to transform a burda like a dried spaghetti with carrots into tasty food.
The "dense trapeze" is a feast of curious historical facts.
The government's response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pie," is particularly picky.
By publicly raising the simple farm cooking of the state of Iowa at the time of his childhood, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire who became.
"He liked a continental kitchen, like a fish with cucumber sauce," Cow said.
He ate almost in a gold canteen, wearing a tux.
He was fantastic off-limits from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book says, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, and that led to the White House "not only to use the most despicable food in Washington, but sometimes also the most despicable prepared."
Many of the cooking sessions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The spouses say that when they wrote the book, they better understand Zigelman's mother's food habits - that she couldn't throw food away, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent of food," Cow said.
Zigelman realizes, "She's really poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case of profiling.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, they and Cow got the dessert they made at home: the christening dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a muse from a black-cream," said Zigelman, adding that it was a common acceptance to give modest prescriptions the brothels.
There were no whipped cream, just a prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
The spoon was unwillingly loaded into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
I'm surprised it wasn't bad.
Cow asked for two more.
He said to his wife, "A little rusted walnuts would be good."
Arrest of persons in the case of a mass fight in the Khovan Cemetery, extended until 14 November
The pre-trial court left the case of a mass fight in the Khovan Cemetery under arrest until the 14th of November, having granted the relevant investigation request.
There are 14 accused in the case.
We will recall that, on 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus had a mass fight at the Khovan Cemetery, which resulted in the death of three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and the co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation", Alexander Bocharnikov, are charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Golodec, during a visit to the Bryan region.
We have specific parameters that need to be raised to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
The economists are now taking stock of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks, "quote the" Interfax "Holoden.
In commenting on the six-year-old-age scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Kudrin, the Vice-Prime Minister reported that the subject was not being addressed in the Kabmin.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension benefits in 2017.
The Kamensky and Grigoryan were held at the end of the small-calibre rifle shooting contest.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan took part in the final of the small-calibre rifle shooting competition at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 and ranked first, a new Olympic record in qualifications.
Cyril Grigoryan was the second to be 628.9 million.
There were eight best athletes in the final.
Kamensky is a world record in this field (633).
One Turkish opposition, Fethullah Gülin, demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d & apos; état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempted coup d'état," quoted Gülen in the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gülin denied any involvement in the coup d & apos; état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
We will recall that an attempt at a military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies will recover the costs of legal services during the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to be reimbursed for the legal fees it has incurred in connection with the claim for a hepatitis C patent with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, which was decided by the Federal District Judge.
In June, Gilead was released from the payment of $200 million for the violation of two Merk patents related to Gilead's medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other unethical acts.
In his appeal to the court on Thursday, a U.S. Federal District Court judge, Beth Lebson Freeman, said that Gilead had the right to be reimbursed for the costs incurred in the course of the challenge.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90% of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which is the basis of the sophobuvir, an active ingredient of the Gilead drug company.
The U.S.-supported armed forces claim to have intercepted full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-supported armed forces took full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, and the group's representative reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (VTS) are now working to clear the city after the remaining group of fighters have left the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants and informed the Reuters Agency, Charfan Darwish, of the military council of Manbij, allied with the VTS.
"The city is under our full control, but we're doing a clean-up operation," he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton issued his 2015 tax statements on Friday, which showed that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and had paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
The potential Vice President Clinton, United States Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, has issued tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency," said Clinton's Electoral Staff Adviser, Jennifer Palmieri.
In total contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and is violating his past promises to make public his tax statements.
It is a common case for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers identified the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax statements.
"Your move," written on Twitter by Clinton's electoral staff adviser Jan Sams, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the end of the tests.
Critics of Trump, including a presidential candidate from the Republican party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republican groups, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other links, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed this question and released an online video on Friday, which focused on the outstanding Republicans who convinced Trump to make tax reports public.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done without exception for decades: to make public his tax statements," she said to the meeting.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business observer quoted on Friday many tax lawyers and accountants who believed that this might still be the case.
The federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who received more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 per cent of the tax rate.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax statements.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS verification, and that Trump was "afraid" not of the tax agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's electoral headquarters has issued tax declarations up to 2007.
The Clinton currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was the low-cost index balance fund, and the Clinton announced $109,000 in dividends and capital income.

Condoms with chili and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmental protection fighters in Tanzania are using a non-traditional way of preventing elephants from entering human settlements, throwing in them condoms filled with chili powder.
The method was effective, and the organization of the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to mind a few years ago, together with the American Committee for Nature Conservation, took on its promotion, training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without causing harm to animals.
A lot of people used spear to protect themselves.
There will be a World Elephant Day on Friday to protect animals.
"Since we invented a set of tools... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harm to elephants," said the executive director of Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of an elephant that has broken the border and to signal by the horn.
If he can't be intimidated, they throw away the so-called "cloud of chili."
The chili powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a clot in a condom, and its end is on, and there's only a fuse left outside.
When the condom is ignited, the condom is broken with a thunderbolt, spraying the small dust of chili powder in the air.
One strangulation is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The last measure is a launch device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country following an attempted coup d & apos; état in July this year.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Melvit Chavushoglu, provided such data in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we have withdrawn 208 staff diplomats to continue to work at the centre.
Of these, 32 persons did not return without objective reasons and explanations, "said the head of the Turkish foreign political authority.
We will recall that a coup d & apos; état took place in Turkey in July.
The authorities had officially stated that the coup d & apos; état had failed, as well as reported the detention of more than 6,000 people, including senior and middle-level military personnel.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people were killed as a result of the coup d & apos; état attempt.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing the Israeli telephone code at the "request" of the Arabs - the RT News channel
A French director of Jewish origin had made a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli phone code on the list, and the employees referred to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lansman, the author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoa," expressed his discontent with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lansman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the hotel's list of telephone codes.
The country, however, was not mentioned among States that could be called directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of a new Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lansman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel administration's desk.
The answer he got there was, according to Lansman, "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said that the measure was "a thought-out decision by the Kempinski hotel network management."
The reason behind this step was even more anger from the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lansman, a hotel official.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as a "terrible disgrace," reported by the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and that hotel network is even more disgraceful.
There's no need for an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions, "said the official.
The case caused a great deal of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel had simply "taken on" the alleged claims of Arab clients.
"Be ashamed," said in another post, where it was stated that the hotel, located on the glorious street of Kurfurstendamm, was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself was in a hurry to dispel any charges, calling what happened "under-sight" and "apologizing" to Lansman, reports to the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the rapid recruitment list," quoted the words of the representative of the Kempinski Hotel of Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
The police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who protest.
The students met with the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The disturbances began when the police tried to disperse the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
Under the proposals of the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing on the walls of graffiti against the Acting President, Michael Temer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters went out on the streets to support President Dilma Rusef, who was elected, when the national Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - reported the RT Business portal
With the lifting of the sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was an increasing interest on the part of Russian firms in business in the country, said the Ambassador.
Russian companies are re-entering Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Jagarian.
He noted that over the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, land-based vehicles and weapons, "said the Ambassador.
Jagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly for tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It can be said with certainty that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia would be hit, "he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend that we visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to roll-out the wigs in the defence and industrial complex.
The reasons for the dismissal were "systematic failure" to comply with the Director-General's instructions to the concert "Almaz-Antey," "lack of work" and "loss of trust."
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed as the head of the NGO for the next three years.
The information about the dismissal of Neskadov was not available until Thursday night, and did not give rise to widespread media coverage.
What is the explanation for such silence in the context of the large-scale rearming of the army?
It is likely that the leadership of the Russian Federation does not wish to disseminate any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This further confirms that there are many problems in the defence and industrial complex (PAC) and that the State is unwilling to bring them to the attention of society.
The removal of Neskadov is, of course, an important development in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO "Almaz" is the main company of a concert that specializes in the production of anti-aircraft systems (RPA) by sea and ground.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of a police-Redute and Morpheus RAP, which is planned for new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitri Cornev, is of the view that the dismissal of Neskadov is due to a failure of the project.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began as early as 2007 and was expected to be operational in 2013.
"Police Redit" should become the main system of air defence on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, no real successful test has been carried out in a few years.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, there is no clear fault in this, "Almaza," said Cornev.
The expert fears that a delay in the entry into service may also occur with the C-500.
The project & apos; s development and development work has not yet been completed, but the first units are expected to enter the military during 2016.
In the Ministry of Defence, it is assured that "work is under way and all will be completed within the established time-frame," although in 2014 the agency recognized that there are problems with the development of C-500.
It is very difficult to assess the professional qualities of the Neskadov, who has been in charge of the Almaty since 2011.
Cornev noted that project delays could be both a cause and a cause for dismissal.
In his view, it had become very difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the OPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of roubles, and large money is known to love silence.
As a rule, the directors of defence companies withdraw from their posts of their own accord, under a contract of agreement between the parties or are transferred to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not a matter of concern.
This suggests that the leader of the "Almaza" was perhaps a figure of stylish and resisted the top-down "dishwasher."
It appears that the State will no longer accept such conduct.
It will be the hands of the shareholders to exclude those who prefer to argue with the Minoborna installations and do not carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the authorities of the Russian Federation are seeking to punish those who have been guided (the "Star" shipyard).
The President himself has given increased attention to sector issues.
Vladimir Putin chairs the Military Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings on rearming.
The Kremlin shall protect the ranks of the management of the KPK, seeking to have a loyal staff of directors, who will follow up on the orders received from the top.
This is a far-reaching policy, but with corruption and lack of normal competition in the OPC, the State does not have other instruments.
The current situation of defence is, of course, not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation is encouraging the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "clean-up" of managers in the OPC, the Russian leadership is taking very successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality with the appointment of Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the President has adopted a well-known saying, "You want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the Soviet Union and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which placed Moscow in the sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked very well.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were evidence of this.
The equity of "winners" in the cold war ended with the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world," there seems to be no single safe corner left.
Despite a common disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of equal partner.
In such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and to reach the new stages of world policy.
The Scottish Kallum Skinner is on the finish line, and as a result, the British are taking the bike gold.
The Scottish Kallum Skinner went to the triumph in a men's team sprint in Rio last night, which led the British team trio to defend his title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow was the most powerful man his friend, Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man was proud to enter history by bowing on the finish straight to break the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared its rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi declared his rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did the trick again after they finished the modestly six at the March World Championship on the Three-Cycle World in London, even though Hoi had since completed his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a professional member, Jamie Staff.
They did it the same time Hindus showed up.
Hoya's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crompton tried to fill out.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in a Scottish that was now being realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the Hoi champions four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record of qualifications, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindes was on a larger show to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi was watching from his place as an invited BBC expert and caught the look of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the play.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a good comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record at the end and won the world's champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoi, Hindes deliberately admitted to the track after a failed start.
He later withdrew from the commentary, and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stand."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many races with a world name that the Olympic win again was just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 race names in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the past five months, then the cycle will have five more successful days.
With the form that Kenny showed, it's not beyond the chance to imagine how he reproduces Hoi's move by winning three Olympic gold medals in the Games.
This would make it possible to see Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), bringing his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoi's.
Next time, Kenny is competing in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have knight."
It was the only one in a day of medals, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dall are qualified as the fastest four-kilometre command race of four.
They finished 3: 51,943.
The world record set at the 2012 London gold win is 3: 51,659.
The first round and the final (10: 42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of his qualification visit, when the officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event, which is resumed and ending tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rousell Shand, Elinor Barker and Cathy Archibald from Milngavi improved the world record by 4: 13,260.
The UK team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the average period of the Olympic Games and make a lot of medals.
In fact, after exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced in the progressive preparations for Rio.
There were drama on the second plan, not the last one, leaving the position of technical director Shane Sutton in April because of allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of large figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendellton.
However, on the basis of the first night of the cycling race, it seems that the legendary glory of the United Kingdom in achieving the highest points at the right time is likely to happen again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant at risk due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of a Portland aluminium plant in Victoria - as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers - is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that provides the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is a result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed grant will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metal plant at Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglessee power plant last year.
The Portland Metallurgical Plant of Alcoa is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strong position of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant & apos; s products.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it expected the other three owners to also take steps to avoid the contract.
The control share of the plant is owned by the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL expects that the port facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called "hedged contracts" which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring its share of income in fiscal year 2017," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on the profits of AGL since the fiscal year 2018 is now limited to projections of a strong futures market for wholesale energy prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its report by $187 million in the form of "forthcoming termination."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to run a steel plant or to supply electricity to a steel plant."
The American company stated that in 2010, it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but that it still had to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steel plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
In response to the analysts earlier this week, the Chief of Operations of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland used about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago used about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a producer, it will be bad, "he said.
Not just the reality show star Cardashian, Kendall on the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, age 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Chris's mother manager, appeared on the September-to-September cover of Vogue's American magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Edie Lauder brand and has been working on a week-long fashion in Milan, Paris, and New York, has reported this news in his Instagram account on Thursday.
"While in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the "Kardashian family"?), a reality-based video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (Rob and Caitlin deboshers, also the world's most favorite business uncle, the producer of the "Kardashian family" Ryan Sikrest), had forgotten the presence of a sister on the cover and, at the end, a classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a standard story line for almost every episode of a children's television show on the birthday (Cicrest says, "You thought we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit from the program at 8: 00 a.m.), but Chris needed that glory to be given to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode of September's Vogue number, we are certainly entering the new era of the Cardashian show.
May the older sister, Kendall Kim, be on the cover of Vogue earlier (she showed up with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September edition is the most sold issue of Vogue in the year.
A large-scale, more like a gift-like publication than a fashion magazine, has attracted a large number of advertisements (based on the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue included an advertisement).
The news of who would be on his cover is so expected that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have been leaked to an official announcement.
The previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "celebrities that work as models" have been presented on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
The "Oscar" award winner and the face of the brand "Dior Jennifer Lawrence" were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gage had the honour.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "outstanding model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not family members of known people, reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video at Snapchat (although Jenner is in all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career with the release of the album "Lemonade."
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, because of her past television reality show star, should have always been shaky.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
This mood is back on track after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to focus on discontent.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all terms of the word.
She's in the field for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a ton cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, is selling you her own photos in her own applications, which are available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own hand-made photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE.
And in free time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's participating in a reality show on television.
Public legal centres refuse 160,000 persons per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected persons are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further cut funding to existing capacity-building activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on - have already been denied, seeking free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the capacity are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Queensland Public Law Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the report of the last census of the National Association of Public Law Centres, thousands of people had already been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government & apos; s decision was not overturned, the situation would only deteriorate.
"Queensland public legal centres are constantly under-funded: this means that thousands of people are denied vital services," he said.
People who leave a violent relationship, people with uncontrollable and debilitating debts, families through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers, all have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the assistance they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator of Queensland, George Brandes, to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raising the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Government of Palaszuk to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court after the staff member allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was brought to court: it is alleged that the headquarters did nothing after the report that his operational director in North Carolina threatened with a gun to a staff member while they were on their way to the Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court action filed on Wednesday with a state court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said he was waiting a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that "it's not gonna happen."
Director Earl Phillip "took out the gun, put his right-hand pointing finger on the trigger, and put a duo on Vincent's knee cup," that's what Bordini claims in the complaint.
When he complained to the local and regional office of the electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, he was said to be in contact.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to hurt them," said Bordini in the complaint.
The action took place only two days after the Republican party's presidential candidate had made a fuse, telling the students in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment," understood as arms owners and their amateurs, could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to choose judges.
Trump's electoral headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini claims compensation from the electoral headquarters for negligence and from Phillip for threat of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip was not a success.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the electoral headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Donald Trump, a Republican party presidential candidate, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Department of the Higher Court of Mecklenburg District (Charlotte).
Britain must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will also bring about recovery and prosperity not only in our own human settlements and in general in London, but throughout the country.
As far as I'm concerned, it was the great advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we will do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case in London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would be in a difficult situation on the world scene.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question he has asked.
Like the Heathrow Olympic Games, it's an infrastructure project for most, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow, which has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment on time and within the budget, from T5, the best airport terminal chosen for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the two most occupied airstrips in the world.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success for Britain, and I'm sure there will be an expansion of Heathrow, too.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow by ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - President of the Council of Heathrow and former Treasury Trade Attaché
Adlock Plus, Facebook plays "cat-mouse" on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money on Internet advertising, attempts to bypass software to block advertising are a "cat-mouse" game, according to one of the companies that create such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block the ads on its desktop version, Adlock Plus published a blog that users could update their filters on the program to block the social media.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the line around its advertising so that it would be more difficult for the advertising blockers to know which parts of the page were advertising.
But Adlock now claims to have been able to circumvent the new code.
In his blog, Adlock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source advertising community and those who are trying to circumvent it has continued since the invention of the advertising block," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world & apos; s largest social network is in the fight is a clear indication of how important the problem has been for the industry & apos; s advertising blockers.
Around 200 million people around the world use advertising blockers, according to last year's study of Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times as many as those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users on Facebook using mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook revenues from advertising.
However, the company is hunting desk-based advertisements, as mobile advertising blockers are not effective in Facebook mobile applications for social media and Instagram, according to the representative.
But advertising in the desktop version is a fairly profitable article to make Facebook think it's a good investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how they were being taxed.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that new adlock filters were disturbing, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising brokers are a rough tool, so we have instead focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to hand over control to people.
A woman was moved on the Swiss highway in an episode of an obvious suicide.
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman has moved several vehicles on the motorway early on Thursday morning in a clear attempt at suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morge in the canton of Vo immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles and reported to the police in a statement.
A number of vehicles, including a truck, were clearly hit by an attempt to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49.
She died on the spot.
A number of involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have told them and anyone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logical" step in this situation was made by counsel Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be found out whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid an impact?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine, "Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be found responsible.
In each case, both of whom involve a person walking through the highway in the dark, it was decided that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of his death by negligence after she hit and killed a man on A1 near Pyern at night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim was drinking and unconscious on the road, hearing the court.
The Court found that a woman police officer, who had responded to an emergency call, was driving a vehicle that had been justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "an exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the police for 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited.
Venus was probably once inhabited, according to NASA's new climate model.
Scientists from the National Space Institute, Goddard, have developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions such as ground-like conditions could ever exist on Venus, with its hot, water-free surface and atmosphere overloaded with carbon dioxide.
The scientists had previously assumed that the low speed of Venus's rotation was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus could probably have a dilute atmosphere like the Earth, and still rotate slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent tighter.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus sets its day side to the sun for almost two months at one time," explained in a press release a GISS scientist, Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a significant part of the solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which are, surprisingly, a few degrees colder than these days on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Even though Venus may have been inhabited, she has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen faded, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche team coach.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice-president of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activities on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice president / chief manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as my chief coach and vice president of the hockey activities, Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said Roy, a 50-year-old, in a statement.
During the summer, I had a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it up to a higher level.
In order to achieve that goal, the vision of the coach and the Vice-President of hockey activities should be the ideal match for the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions have not been met to date.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the League's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in Central Division, but Colorado was turned up by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season, and left the Wild team behind for the second soft trip to the Western Conference for five points.
The Varrior from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cup, two each with Montreal Canadians and Avalanche.
North Sea oil renegotiating and suspending the strike
Working strikes on oil salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the debate are entering into a new round of negotiations, with lead representatives of the parties reporting.
The strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadic on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of negotiations to resolve ongoing disputes," stated in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said had been the first in more than 25 years, had been directed against potential wage cuts up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market tensions.
The company & apos; s lower rates occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract employees working on the bank in 2014.
According to the company, further reductions would give it the space necessary to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, had reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries to 10, as it was streamlining its activities as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower prices of untreated oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that had arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just some," he said in the statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
The Keppler measure the speed of the stars in the Plyad cluster.
The last mission of the space telescope, Keppler, helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of the stars that are part of the Plyad constellation.
The new data help astronomers to understand why the stars in the constellation rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stellar clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said in a press release by Louise Riball, a research member of the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Plyad is located in 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now only mature; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speed, these growing stars throw away large amounts of starwind.
By moving through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds have a slow effect on the stars.
As the star is ageing, its speed is beginning to slow down.
The Keppler measure the speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of the known star spots, such as the sunspots.
The latest speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars are moving slower than less massive stars.
Riball compares the stars with the dancers: the larger ones make the piruets slower than the smaller ones.
"In the" ballet "we see that those who rotate slowly, usually more massive, while those that rotate faster are usually very light stars," said Riball.
Since the Plyad is so close, it is the perfect space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"Pleyada's star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both junior and senior," said Riball.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where and why the stars slow down their speed and put their "dance shoes" on their nails, in a way.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the Plyad speed in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two departments are investigating the activities of a group of detainees in Crimea, and they write "Commersantsu."
The FSB is collecting evidence of detainees & apos; involvement in the preparation of the Crimea sabotage.
As previously reported, a person from the Ukrainian city of Enerdyor Yevgeny Panov, who had agreed to cooperate with the investigation, made a confession.
He said that he had considered the Titan plant in Arniyask, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerchenko ferry, the gas pipeline and one of the military airfields as facilities for sabotage.
Law enforcement is of the view that it is not possible to detain all the members of the dissident community.
This, in particular, gave rise to the arrest of suspects at the Sifferopol Kiev District Court, and notes the publication.
The main coach for Russia's football team was Stanislav Čerchev.
At a meeting of the Russian Football Union & apos; s EXCOM, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Čerchesov as Russia & apos; s main football coach.
The contract with the contract will be for two years, until the completion of the CM-2018.
On August 11, the RFF appointed Stanislav Čerchev as the Russian football coach.
It is a well-known football player who had previously played in the Moscow "Spartacus" in the position of the enemy, as well as a coach with a strong experience, who was a mentor of Russian teams such as the same "Spartacus," "Gemchuzina-Sochi," "Terek," "Amkar," "Dinamo," and the Warsaw "Legia," who was the winner of the national first and the country's Cup. "
It is reported that the contract with Čerchesov will be signed as soon as possible and for a period of two years.
It is therefore his duty to prepare a team for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stouche, Vladimir Panikov, will be part of his coach headquarters.
There is information that the total staff of the coach will pay Euro2.6 billion per year.
According to the media, the RFF authorities have set the goal of bringing Russia's team to the semifinals and winning the medals.
As the coach himself has stated, as a priority, he sees the creation of a competitive environment on the team and is going to give football players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchev, he's glad the choice fell on him.
The first match, under the leadership of Chercesov, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
In the past, the Russian football coach was Leonid Svutsky, who combined him with his career at the CICA club.
He announced his resignation following the failure of the Russian national team to address the Euro-2016 in France.
But he took responsibility for the bad results of the team.
In a long struggle against apartheid, Namibia, which had been laid between Angola and South Africa, had been severely affected.
However, since its independence from South Africa in 1990, the country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made great progress, particularly in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education as their own, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce fees for "cost recovery."
However, in Namibia, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The country & apos; s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of cases per year by 97 per cent in the last 10 years.
Despite the international trend of growing inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
The Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, dropped by 15 points compared to 1993.
Then, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (by less than $1.90 per day) also declined from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of expression rating in Africa, according to "Reporters without Borders."
The country is far ahead of the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the "Corruption Influence Index," which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1 / 3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least for traditional methods of valuation, remains high, at almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high HIV / AIDS rate - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is a higher-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia is, of course, facing some of the difficulties inherent in the underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The desert is inhabited by isolated nomadic hunter-gatherers, who, in one way or another, must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is a challenge for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
Namibia, however, had not thought of falling hands, and it was addressing the challenges it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were engaged in building a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that the competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of health-care visitors in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians realized that neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them but to cooperate, to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
Moreover, the Government of Namibia has rightly held that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that Namibia & apos; s natural wealth income must be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country & apos; s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency was crucial to that process, and the Government & apos; s strong support for freedom of expression was therefore so important.
As the Head of State, Hage Gaingob, has pointed out, the media often say something he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has received, as the President says.
Not all of Namibia's core resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to maintain and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial order, inequality and underdevelopment - can be on the road to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Varna Gold, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 before our age).
It was probably the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts, over 3,000 of a total weight of 6 kilos, were found in the excavation of the Barnen necropolis.
Only one burial known as "grave No. 43" has been recovered from 990 gold items, with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold can soon turn to the unirritable bead found by the archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a pre-historic settlement known as Tel Yunacate.
In contrast to Varna, the port city, Tel Yunacate is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacate Pazarjic district.
Busina is a golden stripe, wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, the excavator of the excavation at Tella Yunatat, dated the discovery of 4600 years before our era and stated that she was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
The treasures of Varna, to be recalled, are dated about the same period, from 4,600 to 4,200 to our age.
There is currently no technology for impeccable metal delivery.
How can you be sure what gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyagiev knows more than he told Reuters, "I'm quite sure that Yunacate's gold is older than Varna's."
It is a finding of extreme importance: it is, in view, a small subject, but it is large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Bojajiev reported that scientists would soon analyse the composition of the metal and would re-examine the archaeological background where the gold artifact had been found.
This will help to give the bead as accurate as possible.
The location of the search also explains a lot.
Tel Yunacate is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
At present, Tel Yunacate is considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
It was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the seven millennium before our age.
In the following centuries, the region has developed rapidly the processing of metals, from the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5-millennium period, urban-type settlements began to emerge around the metal processing centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Telle Yunacate may be the oldest, as the artefacts were found here from 4900 before our age.
I would call Telle Yunacata a prototype of a modern city, even though it's a very old settlement, even compared to Mesopotaia.
"This place is over Schumer for a thousand years," said Bojajiev, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
The first cities have come up there in a common sense of the word.
The distribution of Tel Yunacate has been under way since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 hectares, approximately one third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three metres in height, were found.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, "business centre" and residential margins.
Tel Yunacate is often called the "Bird City," where dozens of clay figures of birds were found.
All birds are shown to be in a state of rest, so it was assumed that they were not decorative objects but objects of local worship.
The "Bird City" was destroyed around 4100 years before our era - perhaps by Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and guns.
The three-metre fortress walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists found clear signs of a brutal massacre, with the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds caused by combat axes found inside their homes.
New developments and new facts are emerging every year, changing the traditional image of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe that was born in the Balkans.
The "Varna gold" found relatively recently in 1972 was a powerful incentive to find this civilization.
It's logical that Varna's gold luxury was supposed to be preceded by something like a tiny gold bead that was created in Tella Yunacata.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially developed.
It is officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by the unit & apos; s personnel who work with serial machines.
The "retro-bow" is, for example, a special colour of the body Etna Blue, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the model logo has been painted.
In addition, the targa received a firm white schedule along the board and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some of the body parts painted in a "white-gold metal."
In the interior of the retrods, it is much less: it is different, in large part, from the grey-blue gamma, from the new seats with extended range of electrical regulations, and from the black, anadised steel to the lobe of the unit.
In addition, when a special version is bought, each buyer will receive a gift for the car and a rich album with photographs of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive has not been made to touch the power unit: the retro-targa is very similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder motor with a turbocharger of 3.0 litres, developing 420 lm and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued in limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular sports.
Facebook and advertising blockers have launched an arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent advertising from being hidden on social media pages has prompted decision makers to block the response.
In AdBlock Plus, they released "antidote," but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus promoted his new technology, which is likely to be effective for a short time.
The representatives of the social media noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the decision from AdBlock Plus, together with commercial announcements, also blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, they deplored the policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the source among the social media developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook website will be available within the next hour.
Thus, social media and blockers have launched a kind of "arms race," trying to beat each other, the affected party has been users who have missed interesting records from friends or have seen advertising where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of the advertising freeze have recently been a source of intense debate.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought before a court of law - Vechny Murmansk.

Dongfeng will bring the crossvan Fengguang 370 to Russia and the Rich New picap, the driver's website www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular car class in China that combines the dignity of the minivan and the crossover.
Another declared Russian premiere is the Rich New.
Many Western firms in the Moscow International Automobile Salon this year have decided to ignore, so the space of the Crocus Expo exhibition rooms will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large species on the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting new developments to our motorists in the near future, will be a powerful front.
One of these will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which was sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550,000 roubles at current rates).
The Russian Federation is unlikely to have such a censor, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, Fengguang 370, by the way, was able to reach number 11 on the list of the most sold minivan, although, due to a large road education (175 mm) and a protective plastic overlay on the lower perimeter of the body, it could well be attributed to the crossboards.
Crossvan is built on the front-door platform of the Fengguang 360, the 370th has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is a little longer (4,565 mm versus 4,510 mm), the design is more solid and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden plankets, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and cars with "music" were made easier to sell.
Five of the seven landing places are easily built up, forming an equal loading area of 1650 mm long, with a maximum baggage capacity of 1,500 persons.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is only one-1.5-litre petrol "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 l.s. and is connected to a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The dynamic quality of the machine is modest, but it is a promise by the manufacturer of the life-saving budget at 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New is a well-known Nissan NP300 Navara from the past generation, but with a little Chinese stylist design.
Despite a morally outdated design, the model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwelcome "working horse."
At a similar price, Rich New will probably be interested in the Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 L (137 ls) or turbodiesel 2.5 L (116 ls).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a hard-on front.
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and a new flagship A9 sedan, his Russian premier, the Chinese company's office announced in June.
Minvand-like crosswords on the Chinese market are growing, one of the last newcomers is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian line Dongfeng consists of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross hatchback.
In seven months of this year, the dealers of a Chinese firm have sold 696 cars in our country.
The transport tax will not be sent by mail to the driver & apos; s website at www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing property tax notices.
All Russian road owners are used to a pattern that has not changed for years: in the summer and in the autumn, they receive a receipt by mail for the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without any noise.
Those who are registered in the "taxpayer's personal office" on the official website of the nalog.ru agency will be informed electronically.
The inspections automatically identified such Russians as online users and removed them from a standard, "paper" distribution.
All owners of vehicles and real estate will be affected by the innovation.
All others will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, there is an opportunity to return to the old scheme also for the account holders on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" as soon as the letter is written, while the letter will go on for a few days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of an Internet-based tax inspection service was over 18 million, which would allow the agency to make serious savings on the mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not sufficient to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could have registered in a "personal office" for a one-time service and had long forgotten it.
These people will not wait for mail notice and, without knowledge, will be in the category of non-paying, with all the consequences.
Access to the "taxpayer's personal office" is done in three ways: through the recording of the gazuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or by entering the logic and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person from any tax inspection office (regardless of the place of registration).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
The notification began in July.
The Tanning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve a very high impact, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of G-Power, who took over the modification of the Mercedes-AMG 63.
The G-Power is known for its reliance on BMW cars, but nothing to human its masters is alien.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63-571-strong flying kowalda with an aerodynamic tank and a spraying to a hundred times a 5.4 s?
By inducing "muscle" of a crazy "helic," the masters took advantage of the benefits of a 5.5-litre high-bow "eight."
And now, the growth of the run-up to a hundred has improved by an indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now a flying "brick" is capable of a 5-1-2-1-2-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-
However, the acceleration at average speeds is likely to be much better.
The speed ceiling avoids: if standard G 63 is not driving more than 210 km / h, a tuning all-road with a deactivated electronic "collar" can withstand 250 km / h
The vehicle outside is almost indistinguishable from its primary source, with the exception of other wheel discs - 23-inch Hurricane RR of 305 / 35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Lux Unit announced an amazing conceptual cube 6 m long, which will be presented as part of the Elegance Competition in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green sub-brand" BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
A minimum of four environmental innovations are expected in the coming years.
