The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed a law establishing administrative liability for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (works, services) in procurement for public and municipal purposes.
The Act is intended to address the very serious problem of non-performance by customers in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, there was a widespread situation where entrepreneurs could not be paid for public and municipal contracts that had already been completed.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because the businessmen themselves were unable to deal with the unscrupulous customers who had entered into unfunded contracts, tried to avoid their payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, 9,700 submissions have been made by the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders and, on the basis of their review, 4,000 officials have been brought to disciplinary proceedings, 533 have been brought against administrative officials, 75 have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the conduct of the proceedings, and 46 have been brought in criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles of debt to entrepreneurs were paid.
These huge amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
The many, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for a much more modest amount have led to debt.
This is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a multi-million roubles competition for social transport services.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but he did not receive the money on time.
The result is an increase in financial debt from wages, taxes, credit that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought assistance from the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt of State and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical levels, the Office of the Prosecutor is working in a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, which deal with all the violations that have been made public by the prosecutors and the measures taken to address them without delay.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslava and Ekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ on amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences on the establishment of administrative liability of the officials of the employer for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work and services) in procurement to ensure State and municipal needs, which the President of the Russian Federation signed last week, will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation on the initiative of the Office of the Attorney-General.
The new law would complement the Russian Federation Code of Administrative Offences with an article that provided for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for the violation by an official of the time and procedure for payment of goods, works and services in State and municipal procurement.
If an official had already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he would be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative novels are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Unit announced a warning of movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The Panel's statement is as follows: "The warning to the travel National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in force until 28 August 2017, calls on African American travellers, visitors and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise greater caution in State travel in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the State and have been reported here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group had been encouraged by a recent law in Missouri, which had made it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims, and by the fact that State law enforcement agencies were disproportionately targeting members of minorities.
"You have human rights violations.
They were stopped on the roads because of skin colour, beaten and killed, "Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People of Missouri, told the newspaper Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints more often than ever."
This is the first warning of this kind issued by an organization against the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had run out of gas during a state trip, and the Missuri State Police arrested him without bringing a crime charge.
The warning also refers to a recent report by the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office of the State of Missouri, according to which the possibility of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is to make people aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they take the money with them for bail or tell their relatives that they travel across the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state sixteenth in the State in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) had previously issued warnings for Texas and Arizona travellers after these states had adopted new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of race checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but in recent times public organizations have used this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown gunmen fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting Reuters, citing the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
Two people, including one police officer, were killed and three were injured during the exchange of fire.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the vehicle opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the perpetrators was detained and the other managed to escape.
Tourism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-return air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with RBK that "positive" was the adoption of a law to abolish the free movement of baggage on non-return air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage," he stressed (a quote on TASS).
However, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of the citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the transportation of the top clothes and mobile phone in the handheld.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that, to say that this is about the upper clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer," said the head of Rosturism.
Previously, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the free delivery of baggage under a non-return air ticket.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of places and the weight of baggage included in the non-return rate.
Vladimir Putin has ordered the elimination of Baikal pollution
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that significant areas of the lake had been exposed to extreme pollution in recent years.
It requested the identification of sources of financing, plans and implementation for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also ordered the full rehabilitation of contaminated areas.
"It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the most of them are worn out," cited by the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Procurator-General of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the arrival of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by recreational operators.
"I want to stress this: not all of them are to be checked, there is also a need to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
The Office of the Attorney-General had previously reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites under environmental supervision.
It will be recalled that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a straight line, stated that it was necessary to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
He was informed of problems with his economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, immediately proposed that the problem be resolved by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buryatiya recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as the restrictions were related to a number of regulations.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs had previously proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
There will be a new temple in Yugra.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community of the indigenous minorities of the North, "Rakhtynya," together with the inhabitants of the Beresov district, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the priest Nikolai Zudovriz.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well-seen from far away, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed and a church bell is available.
The Hungarian REA of the fleet provided a transport escort.
The temple is named after the Holy Nicholas of the Virgin, as he is respected by the Orthodox Church as a patron of the travelers, including the fishermen.
In Sovius, however, fishing provides the settlers with work and food.
The local population is waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it as a local celebrity in school.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why did Singapore comply with the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in a diner in the open air.
In commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after the other, and the cucumber is carefully stored in an iron box brought with him from his office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman is headed to the nearest urn, 100 meters, and he throws the bulbs there.
A fine for garbage in a public place - $500 local - is reported by Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid, you can't throw a fuse from the candy on the bridge, you can't just get a fine.
And now there are cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore's pavement in the middle of the city is clean, like a museum.
Chang says, three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbour drew a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?
Imagine that.
He received 10 blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the inescapable and severe laws, the AIF observer has been on the ground.
No one here is thinking about abolishing the death penalty, which is explained by counsel Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has a long history of not giving a damn about the views of both the EU and the US on this.
If a man takes a large amount of drugs or sells them, he's got a hangover.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, who threatened sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
But the guy was finally hanged.
After that, the drug couriers of our country have been moving hard.
The point is that in Singapore, it is stated that the laws must be enforced by the Council in a row, not just by modest and unrich people.
It doesn't matter who you are, a millionaire, a vice prime, a famous artist or a member of the European Union.
The only way to do this is if you find a half-kilo of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet all over the place with a lot of warnings, you just get a diva - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be bought strictly by prescription (!) of a doctor.
The tourist will not have a gum on his arrival, but we should put a "rubber" on the subway, a fine of US $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white signs on my neck, "I've been garbage."
In addition to a fine, a shard is often sentenced to "lance to the palaces" for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
The six thousand rub pays a "criminal" who forgets to wash water in a public bathroom, and when he tries to fix a small need in an elevator of a residential house, a special detector works, the doors are locked and the signal is sent to the police.
The most exotic laws are the prohibition of the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs, and even the excessive use of room plant (!): the abundance of water is considered to attract mosquito.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can't be allowed to carry lighters on the subway, or they can pay a fine of 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
So, the idea is, as hard as you can, you're gonna have to break something.
It's not like that, it's trying to confuse me of Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency.
The most fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I have not seen anyone get involved for their violation.
Why do they keep it?
So the citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say that if a minor sells cigarettes in a kiosk, everything will be punished in a chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the perpetrator will be hit with sticks on the back, and the seller will also be removed and imprisoned.
It is because of such severe laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that correct?
In the '70s, we had traffic chaos - car drivers ignoring traffic lights, driving like they wanted, getting drunk by the wheel.
After the imposition of the fines for a year, it all calmed down.
Now the driver, when he drinks a piece of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police officer will not be released for a bribe, will tax a fine of the cost of the apartment, and will be sent to prison for years.
Many foreigners in the South-East Asia city-State seem to be a form of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty," a US guest, horrified the people's wealth, "a frightening clean airport," and "a" cultural nature. "
Deserts, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and it should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're right to be afraid of throwing paper on the sidewalk, grabbing when you go in the ice cream subway.
But then you come to the Little India area, and all of a sudden, you're going to break the pattern, and there are plastic cups at the bus stop.
"How is that?" you're surprised.
And that's it, the Singaporeans are laughing.
It happens all the time.
Not every crime like this will be captured on the ground, but you have to know that if you're found, you won't let go, because you broke the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to be normal.
Of course, power in Singapore is self-authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Hoshimin, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
There are a lot of dirty bombs and beggars in central Paris.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to put the trash in the urn.
Singapore, with a set of Dracon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most calm, clean and secure city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was wearing the wheel until they started to fine.
Although the most important thing in Singapore is voluntary enforcement, not fines.
And we need to think that we in Russia, too, would have people happy clean streets, lack of debris on the subway, and would welcome the arrest of those who are confusing the elevator with the public bathroom.
That's corporal punishment. Thank you, don't.
In other words, Singapore's laws are at least worth taking care of.
Is it not a saint?
Now the White House of Trump is aimed at the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a change of regime is when it starts fighting the statues.
The Americans understand this as well as all the others - from here, the deliberate theatre demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at Fierdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump government, knew what he had done when he had made a symbolic point over the Freedom Statute during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
A lot of pleasure ship owners and art artists would be lynching it if he tried.
But he tried to use her meaning, and especially the meaning that was assigned to her in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the play.
As Miller rode on Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Freedom is a... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom. "
Miller is right about the facts, but as he said himself, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, who wish to breathe freely, / the miserable scum of your abundant shores."
Never have "unpleasant scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literary research, he made it clear that in America, Trump, these people are not waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were fighting to put her words on the core of the statue after her death - were very well aware that they were doing a complete political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the link between the French and American republics by means of a banana classic figure, a female image of freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the Mother of the Exiled.
The connection of poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, though right to change it back.
The loud-eyed Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Cross, who announced the arrival of Trump, in 2010, argued that freedom did not invite anyone, rather it was an early neo-observant carrying the flames of America to a world in the dark: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the US. "
Limbo's routine really got a point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the perspective.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, unhappy but full of hope of the people on the deck of the ships after long and often heavy navigation.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance of a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they wish to hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not needed to light the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the UK.
Eilid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottish in the UK.
Neil Blake, the director of the British Light Athletics Federation, stated that a 16-man Scottish part of the World Cup team would "make a significant contribution to the team."
The record number of Scottish light athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship, which began on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland, "something special is born" and that the British Light Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we're gonna support it while they have potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks that what they did has to be done.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they did, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why this is the case, but it's completely brilliant. "
Some of the Scottish light athletes are applying for medals, including Laura Mur and Andrew Bacha, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Eilid Doyle has chosen his own captain.
"Eilid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great, "says Blake.
"Many light athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or train, have left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into it were great. "
The owner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who at his fifth World Cup will run 400 m away with obstacles, says that 16 Scottish in the British team are "incredible."
The previous record for the number of Scottish at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mur is ahead of us, who specializes in running at the middle distance and defeated five British and two European records last year.
She's going to run at 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who is going to run at 1,500 m, is another Scottish to be noted: behind his back, he had a good season, where he had a win at the British team's selection and the annual competition.
Doyle is thinking about his first World Cup when, apart from her, the only Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team's captain says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the team, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was, in any case, a great honour, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, that's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish who entered the team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they're all light athletes who will be trying to get on a pedestal of honor.
And what about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and to take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go out on his rent and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere will be just great. "
Thing critics on Facebook: you don't have to run for public office if you're not ready to listen to the voters' criticism.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "You can take away the freedom of speech and we, deaf and innocent, will be led as sheep to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subjects have blocked and erased at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union for Civil Liberties brought him to court.
The defendants called the claim null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well what."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a remarkably popular Republican Governor in a democratic state.
He is second in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a strong hand in the management of the state and his commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as a primary means of communication with his voters and shows his bald head on his page with jokes.
Therefore, it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block people who come to the Governor's page - who are declared an official public forum and are held by the staff of the administration on taxpayers' money.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the press secretary, Amelia Chess, defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was just their simulation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spamers and hiters that are on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trollis, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
Pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan being a Catholic.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman's lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary to the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some say immediately that it's a so-called thing, instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam-attack," others would probably call an "active life-style."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to reedit its image by just blocking critics or styling negative comments.
It is a much less dusty job than before when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical outposts or arresting and shutting up protesters.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were captured on his Twitter account.
One of the first turning decisions on this topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria, James C. Casheris, the President of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by entertaining the voter in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor, Matt Bavin, filed claims with the American Civil Liberties Alliance for his Facebook and Twitter behaviour.
It's not supposed to be that hard.
In the Washington era, affordable mail costs were about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the name of "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belyrius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers that mocked Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents online project, his office was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to living at Renaissance.
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferty, is looking forward to home-based accommodation for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
A Northern Ireland woman who was in the neighborhood at the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year, until he lost Paul Iles, is attached to a new place and is a member of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarwadi Club.
"I saw the Renaissance club build, and we're watching him come to a success with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at his best, it's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is a strong supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field. "
The English Iles is looking forward to the first opportunity to stand for the championship, even though he won his 32-year career in both the European Championship and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a really special feeling," said a player from Southport.
"I failed to try again to win" Extremadura Open, "because he was taken out of the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magic.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and for me and my wife, Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it. "
He returned to his home country, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior athletes' tournament after he was 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the "Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open" tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to do a good job, but you feel that extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed you a good golf.
I'm happy with how it's done so far. "
In the field of the trio, the former winner of the Masters, Ian Wusnham, and the senior athletes, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, will join.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup, Sam Torrance, are two of the six Scottish on the field; the rest are Andrew Aldkorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds an hour if there's one person in the car and 10 pounds if there's two or more people.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels of their own that are capable of absorbing the carbon monoxide emitted by vehicles are already being tested on British roads.
The country & apos; s transport agency, according to the Autocar publication, reported positive results on a 100-metre tunnel on a road in the north.
A 6-metre high tunnel is built of some recent polymeric materials that can absorb the harmful substances contained in road emissions.
However, the establishment of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English are going to expand the network of electric vehicle charging stations, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial electric transport and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Mosgorcourt changed the sentence of a disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Mosgorcourt changed the sentence of a disabled person, Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years of colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
This is reported by TASS.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the period with a suspended period, explaining its request that the disease of Mamaev "prevented him from being in prison."
Anton Mamayev, 28 years old, was sentenced to four and a half years & apos; imprisonment, serving a sentence in a general-regime colony for robbery against a former Special Forces fighter.
On 19 July, a court in a retreat to the SIZO released a man from custody.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian "gold land"
Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove when he's ready for lunch.
She doesn't even use a pot.
In her wooden house in Enaratali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just puts sweet potatoes, which is called "note," right in the middle.
In half an hour, the tuber is taken out and eaten by inpatient, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the ground floor - she has no furniture - and this is where she does her work on the house, such as washing her clothes with the dusty water from a nearby swamp.
The janitor is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, and that's why she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Plurality is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one is allowed to walk in the village after 5: 00," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, with their hands in the face of the occupying forces.
The existing pro-independence movement from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which has maintained strong control over the region by preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea is in the eastern part of the island.
Enaratali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, Nabir, and then a five-hour shake in a car.
There's no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs of grilled steel are painted with rust in a variety of red shade.
Few of the Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, came here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuas mee pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not comfortable wearing these clothes," says Degeys, showing on his bright, hand-held turban, dark skirt, and a bright shirt.
"We used to wear leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a high-mountain province, about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport received gold and copper for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be commended for its forest reserves, estimated at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, is a one-time disaster for the Papuas, ensuring that Indonesia's strong armed forces maintain a suffocating presence.
According to an investigation into the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid almost $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuas threaten the existence of this golden home and are being suppressed with ruthless oppression.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the indigenous highlands of Papua during the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by Brisbane Eparchia, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - particularly frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shocks - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The rations have been prolonged, as Papua's resources have attracted an influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province & apos; s 3.5-million population is 83 per cent Christian, but the demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated Indonesian islands, Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Yavan shops, "Varungi," sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables with peanut sauce.
The local people are trying to compete.
"Migrants have started to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua," explains Beth Yow, a 20-year-old born of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, because of his work.
"Because of this, Papua's indigenous people, Papua's mother (women), have lost their market."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, known as the people of Jokovi, pledged to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On its way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace, the former carpenter was supported by 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, waiting for him to meet our hopes for justice," said Yo.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jokovi Paniai, he survived a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthem at the fire in Enaratali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The scared children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was angry with their tone and returned with four soldiers some time later.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Eimo, was beaten so badly, he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a government building near the election commission, and the situation worsened the following day.
About a thousand Papuas men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting beetles, and they performed the white, the dance of the Papuas tribe of Me Pago: they ran in circles, and they played bird singing.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, the internal radio officers were ordered to: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," it was said in an official document that TIME's correspondents saw, but which was not published in the local media.
The fifty-six-year-old Yeremias Kayame, the head of the Kong Koto district in Enaratali, felt a sense of danger and called for calm by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME," standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who shot him, but he says that the bullet came from the hands of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of shots," he added.
The local resident of Alfius Jowa was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, told.
"I ran up to him and I looked at his body to make sure it was him," he told the magazine "TIME" by Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, told the reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the Papua Police Commissioner, Pujo Sulisliyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news about the murders just got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a speech in Jayapur expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation settled immediately, so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, we made excuses.
"Most of the violations have taken place a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s or at the beginning of zero.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed, "he said.
Viranto then refused to speak with TIME magazine on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It will be decided through a court of law."
The Viranto accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody vote for the independence of East Timor said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims from Paniai have received such statements with a grim distrust.
"In the last three years, I've been asked four times, but there has been no change at all," said Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in the nearby Paniai district of Deyay.
In a clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, a 20-year-old Ravianus Dow, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company & apos; s construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded with warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retribution," said to the magazine "TIME" of 20-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw how quickly they delivered the wounded.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved be held accountable and that the mobile police team be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is due to the discontent of the mee, moni, dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to be protecting the rights of the Papuas by conducting sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of "protecting national independence" in Paniai in recent years.
Some never came back.
The population of Papua Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty is increasing discontent.
A small portion of the rice sold in Enaratali is too expensive for the local population.
The bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers of the note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there has been an increase in economic inequality between indigenous Papuas and new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabir airport.
The few existing vacancies are usually given to more educated and wealthy migrants.
The Papuans rarely have the money or skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no job or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskudi and Basile Lonshan were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant organizations" despite being given rare video permits.
According to Felim Kine, Deputy Director for Asia of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Yokohama campaign to lift media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are now facing new risks: denial of a visa and blacklist," he said in the statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States, Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
The representative of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanata Nassir, gave up the group's statement, informing the journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
The local population wanted more foreign Governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Kis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local residents broke the silence of saying, "We want freedom," as the source, who was also present but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the Papuas say that they are unlikely to vote again for Jokovi.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, the president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat of the greedy army, are in poverty, and they are in a poor state of education and health care.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like the other popuas, consider their voice for Jokovi a duty that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground right across from the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice is likely never to be achieved, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"Killed by a member of our family," said Jacobus without raising his head.
"What else could we do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel."
The fire reached one of the world & apos; s highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave a 70-nine-storey structure of 337 metres of embroidery.
This is the second fire that's been going through a high-level building - which, by coincidence, is called "Fakel" - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no human casualties were reported and no operational news was provided on the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said Reuters was a skyscraper called George.
According to the Civil Defence Department of Dubai, fire teams put out a fire at about 4: 00 local time (00: 00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The event can put on the agenda the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high buildings around the world.
In an investigation by the Fakala administration, after a fire in 2015, it was found that the most affected were the boreholes, the external panels used for processing and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the wiring panels of the Granfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the fire there in June, which had killed some 80 people.
The increase in the Ida-Virumaa tourist flow in June was minimal
A total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, an increase of 125 or 0.6 per cent over the same period the previous year, were used by a correspondent of the Rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics in June 2017.
The number of local tourists has declined and foreign tourists have increased.
In June, for example, the foreign tourism flow increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The region & apos; s most visible increase in the number of Russian tourists was 8.9 per cent, or 318, compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to the fans who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov has pointed out to his fans at Instagram who is responsible for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumours, but today he has posted a piece of the paper "Statement" on 1 August.
Photo by Malakhov signed the "Milk boss" tag.
The article on how to prevent the "burning" of an employee and to draw attention to his or her condition.
When we recall numerous reports that the lead was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who has begun to reform "Let them say," it is clear what he has so clearly indicated is written by "KP."
It is reported that the television leader Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed the application for dismissal from the First Canal.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car explosion
At least five military personnel were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand and are handing over RIA News.
According to the police, a mine-propelled vehicle exploded near a military checkpoint in Girishk County the other night.
We know 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver made a video of the shark who took his camera.
Diver and a research researcher, Greg Skomal, recorded a video of a shark who had a GoPro camera.
The United States Marine Fisheries Agency in the state of Massachusetts, with a staff member, is a member of the United States Marine Fisheries Agency.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to take the shark off on a cell that was held on a special stick during a submarine.
When a man was seen, an animal more than three metres in length came to him.
The shark took a bite on the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
He explained that the predator had done so to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily have destroyed the device.
He also noted that such behaviour of a marine animal had turned out to be new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight at the Ural military centre is known
A working group of senior military officers from the Central Military District came to the Elena Training Centre, where a mass fight took place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of the massacre have already become known.
According to the Mash pavilion, which appeared on the Vkontakte page, the Ural military contract number 31612 had a violent fight over an unsettled bed.
It all started with a private one named Saiyan, being a demonstration of the officer's order to fill a stoned sheet.
The military from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were smashed in the bed and sink barracks, and the glass was beaten out.
More than 10 people were affected in a mass fight.
The KVO denied the stabbing information.
The study found that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States are carrying prohibited items on the plane.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of the air passengers were knowingly or accidentally on board the aircraft through the United States Transport Safety Administration inspection points, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, who were under-seen carrying prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were deliberately trying to fly with something prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were Millenials, compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the Xi Generation.
ATO personnel are the most likely to pass through food and water.
More than 3 per cent acknowledged that they had carried out a special inspection of sharp items, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents had admitted that they had knowingly carried prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company stated that it was studying passengers throughout the country to know how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport searches and how many were knowingly doing so.
It is expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggling is carried through the search of those who fly most.
According to the company, the ABB rules are rather complex and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what kind of liquid they can carry or how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB takes is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB could be considered illegal for the transport of a book.
Liquids are allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
The head of EPA Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the Obama emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15-state claim, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to defer compliance with the Obama regulations aimed at reducing emissions of air-polluting substances resulting in the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive than in previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention an action against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute took place around the 1 October deadline, by which the states should ensure that the 2015 ozone standards were met at the land level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance by one year to allow his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "inconformity with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who, before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent opponent of the strengthening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations against the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Püitt to return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington held that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority to try to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by radically changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the responsibility of EPA to cooperate with the States in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the target date, then waiting for claims from groups of activists and others and discussing the time frame for the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take the time frame seriously.
We also take our statute and the power that he gives us. "
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point again use his "powers to defer and other statutory powers" to ensure that the rules "jcyjdfys are clear and on all available information."
The Republicans in Congress are insisting on a broader review of the ozone regulations.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a claim against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"The change in the course of EPA - after our claims - is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by the closure of their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of D.C., joined the New York case.
Land-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries, chemicals and other sources react with sunlight.
The resulting person could cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It is sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this completely logical step from the man who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of light athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of the extension of the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (VFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
In favour of the extension of the suspension, 166 votes were cast, against 21, by TASS.
The IAAF Council report stated that the WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Council for the re-establishment of membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFL at the World Cup in London, Russian light athletes were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
The team was made up of 19 people admitted to IAAF.
The VFLA was instantly disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Pound, was published at that time, which referred to the many violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, read in "I" IAAF extended the sanctions against the WFL. "
Indirect defeat
In the three rounds of the Russian Federation's Fonbeth, the new-Moscow team "Chemic" conducted a retreat against the FK "Kaluga."
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The Himic did not give in to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to a bitter goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the caluzhans with a 0: 3 count, many have given the easy victory of the owners in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, newcomers have been forced to consider and act with themselves from defence, but from a position of force.
In 1 time, the caluzhan were more built and took advantage of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was conducted by Alexei Sirotin, who, on several occasions, reflected dangerous strikes and gave confidence to partners.
Unfortunately, the Himika attack lacked the effort and the luck to put the Kalugi in a dead end and to hit the first goal of the exit.
After the break, the game began to go on counter-course.
The Novomoskowans have been more involved in the attack.
The alarm for our team was a defence error that allowed the caluzat to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemick intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the caluzhan has played a role - they have done a more literate and cold-blooded ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Himic moved the ball to the corner, which the field owners had been given without resistance to transfer to the gate.
Yuri Dubrovin was the author of the goal.
In the reporting meeting, the Himic showed a good game, but suffered a terrible defeat.
Our team is waiting for another exit, on 11 August at 19 a.m. in Moscow at the Torpedo Stadium, Edouard Streltsov, the newcomers will fight with the leader of the "FK Centre" Ararat, which is composed of Roman Pawlichenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexi Reko.
Come and support the Chemick!
The place and time of the meeting of new-born people is 6: 30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (East, d.2, Corp.
Composition of the "Himika": Sirotin, Manohin (c), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogiya (Oreskin), Dudati, Ryzov, Saints, Belanin (Adoyetsev), Andraychenko (Ligin)
Himic Press Service
According to the published telephone decryption, Trump was press to Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border.
The Washington Post newspaper published telephone decryptions between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone call with the President of Mexico, Enrique Pieya Nieta Trump insisted that he should stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States was arguing that he had publicly spoken out against the wall, and according to information that had been leaked, he said, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
The published decryption of his first telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, also found a hot rematch.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees going to Australia was "funny," "disgusting" and "stupid," and insisted that, because of an agreement made by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop moving refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day."
The bodies of the victims in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to the Russian airline, which is carrying the bodies of the Russian men who died in Abkhazia, flew at 20: 15 hours Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, and is being transferred to TASS.
At the end of the journey, the officers of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city & apos; s mayor, will meet and tell the journalists the Deputy Minister for resort and tourism of Abkhazia, Astamyr Ahba.
The representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic had previously stated that all the costs of bringing the bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, official Sukhumi intends to pay 500,000 roubles to the families of the victims.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership had expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the bombings for their flight and residence in the Republic, but the relatives had only sent to the Republic the power of attorney for the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 4: 20 p.m. Moscow time, two explosions were carried out in the village of the Primaritime Gudaute district at the missile and artillery storage facility of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, before detonating the large-calibre shells and other ammunition contained there.
As a result, the storage area was set on fire, which caused uncontrollable explosions of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timofev, born in 1962, were killed on vacation near a hydrogen source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to the medical facilities of the Republic with varying degrees of gravity.
At present, seven persons remain in prison and the rest are issued.
The study of the Russian influence on American elections will be carried out by a large jury
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Müller, has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., which will study Russia's influence on the election of the United States President in 2016 and report to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
The grand jury's call gives Müller additional power to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which started work a few weeks ago, will be the details of a meeting of the son, then another presidential candidate, Donald Trump, with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnica.
The meeting, held in June 2016, was previously promised by Muller himself.
They've already been examined by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump, Jr., had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. had previously said that, from his meeting with Weselnica, he had been waiting for a compromise on the headquarters of the Demparty candidate Hillary Clinton, but that no disclosure documents had been submitted, and that the adoption had been the result.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr., for a meeting with Weselnica, was literally dictated by Trump Senior.
In the White House, it was specified that the President had not dictated anything, but had just used his authority, which any father would have done.
The vice-mayor of Penza was detained at the workplace.
The Deputy Chief of Administration of Penza, Irina Shirshin, was detained for 48 hours on the instructions of the Investigation Committee at his workplace and reports to RIA News.
No official reports have yet been received from the law enforcement agencies on this matter, but the press service of the UK SC has assured them that they will follow.
At the city of Penza, there's no comment on what happened yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
It has been responsible for urban development and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had long been the head of the Department of State Building Inspection in the Penzen region.
Irina Shirshin is raising three minor children, noting that once again as a mother a year ago, she refused to take maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no launch vehicle or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bra is a tribute to the first person to be in space.
In contrast to the Soviet-period monuments that are being destroyed in some countries, Gagarina's monuments, on the contrary, are "walking around the planet."
In 2012, a monument was set up in American Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was set for the fiftieth anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a Gagarina monument in Germany in Erfoot, where our astronaut was in 1963.
A memorial in Karlovov Varah (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the centre of the city to the area in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th anniversary, a monument of Jurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
That's the name of the first astronaut in Latvian, and it looks like he was 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to bring to justice
In 1948, Ford Mercury passed by the audience in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia, and with a river, he went to the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver came to the bridge, a group of white men with guns prevented it from going.
The man in charge, a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin stripe, had a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Those who sit inside were trembling at fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" a man said.
"Get him out of the car!"
The noises broke the silence when a young black man was removed from the front seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a play.
But when Roger's neck was hit with a noose, almost all the viewers were really holding their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night when, in 1946, there were two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malta and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them with us; even though we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the play.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who has been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until justice is achieved."
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI reports received by BBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two linked vigilante motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, for the first time, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens to vote on the primeris to be held that summer.
About the same election, according to FBI reports, a black user, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester in a fight, a white landlord, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to the rumor in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on 25 July 1946, Leah Harrison, a large white landlord, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were on their way out of prison and coming up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and ordered Harrison's murder," that's what the FBI report says.
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only took part in the killings but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it short.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he said.
"They were all killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green runs an annual show that reproduces that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her play is visible, he takes over the audience and reports on the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's even harder to turn around, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they're showing us our own ugly," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The practice of this year's play began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered in the room and listened to a year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been a major member of the clan for years, but he says it's never been easier.
"I think I'm a little dirty because it's not the man I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at the time."
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who are playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are replaying their roles.
Spectal starts with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
He screams Raskon back.
There's a blow going on.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is being whipped.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is it," asked Askon.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the white people used to say" nigga. "
"Yes, yes," one of the black performers is laughing.
"You have to call a firm 'r'."
And the energy in the room is also changing: discomfort is changed by the sense of partnership.
All must do the right thing, not just for the play, but also for the memory of the four dead.
The stage starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n," it is clear and sharp.
No one's laughing.
The play ends brutally and quickly.
Scream, shots, and then silence.
The woman in the mourning black clothes is above the bodies of the actors and is performing a sad song by Billy Holiday, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is broken through the word.
In a hundred yards from her, half a hundred viewers are taken out of their eyes with tears and sweat.
The number of black and white is almost equal among the audience.
One couple came from Itaka, New York, to see the show; many people live close by.
They had all been patient for almost eight hours with Georgia's heavy perfume while Brooks was taking them to a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsi.
So far, the murders have remained only a story, but now that they are in the same place as people were being lynched, their ghosts seem to be in the air.
When the last note of the song is quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
The children go up to their heads, touch the paint that depicts blood, and the bodies that are still standing and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mumbles, like, to remind himself of that.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
The actors drop the ropes off the neck and wipe out the tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main doll.
Nick Raskon is hugging two other actors and suddenly crying falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the play finally hit him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had reason to do so. "
Later, the audience will sit down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is talking a lot about the black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski is hard to find words to describe how she feels after the play.
"It's hard to listen to these terrible, creepy words, and the actions... of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police are shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who is thinking of his work as a human rights defender, has received a common attention.
He said that he had already begun to plan next year's submission.
"The setting is encouraging, because it not only describes the horror of what we have been through, but it also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their story, are doomed to repeat it. "
The Court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitational Saturday."
The Simonov Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny for 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the meeting.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, "Reacting violation of the procedure for organizing a meeting."
In the past, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizir Mussakayev, had completed an administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of staff of opposition, Alexei Navalny, who had been held accountable under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakayev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "agitational Saturday" held by Navalny's supporters in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
When they saw the Aghitmaterial following the participants in the Saturday, the police considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature, a public action (for which prior authorization from the capital authorities must be requested).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuev requested that administrative proceedings be discontinued due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain omissions in the drafting of the report.
Volkova was not detained on the "agitational Saturday" itself, but he received a summons requiring him to come to the police station to report on an event with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another member of the opposition, Nikolai Laskin, also received the same summons.
In Mordovia, the shooting bride and three wedding guests were arrested.
The court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the National Office of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During a fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several times at a guest for events that had come to the rural pond for bathing.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraphs (a), (e), and (2) (attempt to kill two or more persons in a generally dangerous manner from a bully cause).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that a man had opened fire because the wedding party had decided to take a bath and went through his section to the water.
The Ministry of Energy will strengthen the requirements for the suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules on the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular the turbines for power plants.
In the case of gas turbines, the GEO turbine, oil transfer facilities and the production of oil, equipment suppliers will be required to share data on access with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government Regulation is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only apply to "critical energy equipment" being supplied to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded the anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens.
On 4 August, the European Union Press Service stated that the anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to a scandal around the supply of Siemens to Crimea.
The "Arguments of the Week" had previously reported this.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been extended because of the Siemens-made riots that had allegedly been taken to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand the anti-Russian sanctions.
It had previously been reported that a final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and that the decision had been adopted, and the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson is reducing another 3,000 jobs and reducing dividends to bring business back to life.
On Friday, the British educational group Pearson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the preliminary dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the start of a new restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems facing their business.
These job reductions, which, according to John Fallon's head of company, will mostly take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were reduced under the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to reduce expenditure by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost-reduction programme to try to bring back to life a business that was hit by a rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share of the "Penguin Random House" to its partner, the "Bertelsman" concert, said that its projections for the year had remained unchanged, after it had announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: Nato & apos; s soldier died as a result of a suicide attack
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as reported by NATO.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of an incident in the urban area of Karabakh.
The explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a "man-carried improvised explosive device."
All the wounded are reported to be in a stable condition and receive treatment at the United States military hospital at Bagram airfield.
The respondents report that the growing strength of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to United Nations reports, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber in a vehicle caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On 31 May, a major explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the most serious loss of life in the country since United States-led troops had removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence has highlighted the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether there is a need to increase the number of US military forces providing assistance to the country's troops and police.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, shall rescind the decision to postpone the adoption of the air pollution law.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency had overturned its decision to defer the adoption of the Obama era law, which required states to limit air pollution emissions one day after 15 States had brought the agency to court because of that step.
In the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements 2015," stressing that this step demonstrated the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue and responsiveness with our state partners," said Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, most of them democratic, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a claim alleging that that intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to reverse a wide range of environmental protection regulations imposed by the previous President, Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at shiny economic growth.
But action in this direction has led to resistance from democracies and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website states that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing "may aggravate the function of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms," for example asthma.
The European Business Association has opposed new anti-Russian sanctions.
The European Business Association has expressed its opposition to US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In the view of the AEBA, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEBA statement stated that business was an important link between countries and people, and therefore the principles of free trade could not be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies are asking the police to limit movement on the coast of Pskov.
The Pskov people & apos; s electors sent a message to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city of Sergei Suriname on the problem of movement along the Great River.
The deputies of Konstantin Balotin, Grigori Tesnikov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists are preventing people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control would help to make the area more secure and secure.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs "Pedestrian" and travel freely on the shore.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements have been carried out for nothing.
The sports and children & apos; s sites are becoming uncomfortable because of the cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings, the central overboard patrols are carried out by members of the PPP motorpatrol and by friends.
They make the number of vehicles passing less, but they do not stop all traffic.
Putin required the investigative authorities not to remove the hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed that the investigative authorities should not be allowed to take away servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
The Head of State said so at a meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, "it is necessary to exclude, in the interests of the investigation, the application of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers."
Putin noted that if the investigators had such a need, "it is sufficient to remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The Head of State added that "it is not possible to create conditions that prevent the enterprise from continuing to operate until tax is not available."

The British actor Robert Hardy died.
The British actor Robert Hardy, who played the magic minister Cornelius Fadja in the screening of the Harry Potter series, died in '92.
On Thursday, the newspaper "Independant" reported this.
He was told by his family about the death of the actor.
According to them, he has lived "a great life, having been successful in film, theatre and television in 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier at the "Coriolan Tragey."
Hardy also remembered the repeated role of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenings of Agatha Christy's work on Ms. Marple.
He was also awarded the British Academy of Cinematographic and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for the role of Churchill in the BBC's "Winston Churchill: The Wildness Years" (1981).
Robert Hardy was also elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the United States on several occasions.
There is something in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his venzenos wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the party has a gold wedding, but the couple's agenda is not to prepare for the celebrations, but to have a flimsy argument.
His Highness has renounced the title of the Prince-Conclass, and he has intoxicated the Queen that he has never been given the title of the King-Conclass.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains an official wife of the Queen.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on Washington to stop shrewd Moscow.
In the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they responded to Mike Pence's statements accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant declaration was circulated by the foreign political authority some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the United States was increasingly using cold-war strains that were inadequate to present-day realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop dumping the Russian Federation.
As the "Arguments of the Week" were written the previous day, United States Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, and there's a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight.
Vasily Lomachenko and Miki Garcia, who appear to be on their way to the most exciting boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the office of ESPN in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an undefeated champion in the light weight of the World Boxing Council, went down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization champion in the second half-light weight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former World Champion in the four weight categories of Erin Broner on Saturday's Showtime, both boxers are in the top five boxers, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko is protecting his belt in a fight with Miguel Mariaga on Saturday at 7: 00 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers were posing for the photo, the manager of Lomachenko Eghis Climas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be the right time.
"I used to be a half-light weight," I reminded Garcia.
"I went up to the category for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a little small for 140.
I want to go down to half-light.
And he needs to get up to half-light, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the cheerleaders want.
Let's give them that. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of his strategy to have Lomachenko fight his debut at 135 later this year to set up a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the victory between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the World Cup of Peace on September 23.
"The fight can be on the PPV because all the fans asked for it," said Garcia, saying he was ready to fight on that channel that would offer better financial terms.
"We are the main names.
No other names would give rise to such an interest.
As soon as they're ready... "
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko's a "great boxer" and maybe he's going to visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately go to Garcia with his praises, and he said that, in his opinion, the champion in three scales from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a nokout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the impact and then the box.
They both said they felt the tension in front of their own fight.
"This fight must take place.
No other fight is so much interest or conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight. "

Putin asked the Attorney General's Office to check on Baikal.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to review the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I request the Office of the Attorney-General to check the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities," said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that action be taken if the facts of the violations were found.
New results of the tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the asylum-seekers & apos; tests in Sweden, which had been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, showed that more than 80 per cent of those tested had been estimated to be over 18 years of age, but not all had confidence in the accuracy of those results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment more accurate in the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for not being able to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be under age.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 test cases, and the forensic health agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were estimated to be 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic health agency estimated that the test person "probably 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the report stated that the person was "probably under 18."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Goransson of the forensic medical agency, the results are consistent with those of the past months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics from the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he said to the "The Local" portal.
A high proportion of cases in which people were estimated to have reached the age of 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases "it is likely that the age of the test is 18 years or more."
However, after considering 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had publicly stated that 18 were being executed this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, which is to make an X-ray of the teeth of wisdom and the tomography of the knee joint and to provide it for analysis to dentists and X-rays, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through sexual maturity before or later than normal.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurately defined.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we don't have to pretend we can, "he said" Metro. "
However, Goranssen of the forensic medical agency suggested that the tests should be accurate: "In general, it can be said that the risk of a child being mistakenly taken as an adult male.
The greatest risk we face is when the person is about 18, in which case he is about 10%. "
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin stated that he was prepared to consider whether to run for the Russian President in the 2018 elections, he would be transmitting "Interfax."
This statement was a response to a request from the residents of the village of Cheremuchka, Buryatskaya region.
During a video conference on the fire in Buryatiya and Irkutsk region, the interviewee addressed Putin with the words "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request that, when the next presidential election is held, we all ask you to run again for that post."
"All right, I'll think, thank you," said the president.
On 28 July, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the statements made by some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin would be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation, Anton Vainno.
The sand called these assumptions "unbased, hypothetical considerations."
"As long as there are no headquarters, until the establishment of the headquarters is far, until the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"Until this is on the agenda," Peskov said.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, a Democratic Party representative, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats are away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you as a Democratic Governor."
The meeting exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I'll change my registration to a Republican," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42% overweight, and Justice did not support a Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that "The transition of Governor Justice to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is preventing rather than working to make our country a great again."
"Given only 15 governors and the control over the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another renunciation of a party that has no leaders from the top to the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," reported in a CBS News statement by a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel.
The cat-heavy guy named Mr. Beauty found a house with social media.
Pittsboro's nephew (North Carolina, United States) built a cat named Mr. Beauty over 14 kilograms after being famous on the Internet.
Mashable reports it.
In late June, a picture of the cat was published in the Facebook pet account, asking for its owner to be found, because "it was clearly fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could become a new mem.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likas and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview on WNCN, an American woman said that she had already had such experience: she took home a cat of about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
A post with a picture of an animal has collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could have made a career in the model business.
Kou praised Russia's "sincere" apology for the doping scandal.
On Thursday, an international athletic expert, Sebastian Kow, praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not a good time to allow the country to participate again in sports.
The Russian representative of Dmitri Schlahtin, the Federation of Light Atlétics, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Light-Atlétic Federations, held on the eve of the World Cup for Light Atletics, that his country & apos; s removal from sports had been fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen from the competition."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light-Atlantic Federations voted in favour of maintaining the November 2015 suspension after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on State-funded doping evidence.
"I thought today's response, today's report was very sincere," said the President of the International Association of Kow Light Athletic Federations to the reporters.
"The whole council and the whole Congress have enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has been through very hot times and is now doing its utmost to take care of the restructuring of the Federation."
Kou said he also "liked" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia's rights," said Kou.
"In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate net athletes from the shaded system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Atlantic Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Cup for Light athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met in order to restore Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London following a report made at the Board of the International Association of Light Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not sufficient and the suspended coaches are still doing their job.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a public official.
A journalist, Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), was placed under arrest for two months and transferred to the Security Council.
A member of the Internet publication "Zitomir Journal" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and by encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
However, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The "Commandant Borsini" patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the flow of illegal migrants, together with the Navy.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome had agreed on it with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, did not control most of the country & apos; s territory.
The opposing Cabinet and the Tubroska-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libya & apos; s sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarsal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe those threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of the Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan Cabinet, Fayz Saraj.
The Italian authorities have undertaken the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the release in July of statistics on the number of illegal arrivals from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A large-scale malfunction occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype was recorded today in several countries of the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to send complaints to programme developers on a massive basis.
In Microsoft, it was stressed that the experts were already working actively to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, clarifying the "News" RIA.
We will recall that Skype also failed in June this year.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian team for the light athletics were suspended from participating in the FM.
Olga Zemliak and Olesia Povh, who specialize in running at short distances, are excluded from Ukraine's team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the country (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against light athletes by the International Association of Light Atlantic Federations (IAAF).
The Ukrainian delegation also excluded the coach of Zemjak Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects a sportswoman to use doping.

How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Neimar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world-record Nemar's transition from Spanish "Barcelona" to French "Pari Saint-Germain."
Any further consequences may come along the chain, for the Pari Saint-Germain by the UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, whose authorities prohibit the teams from participating in the prestigious tournament of the League of Champions.
It is clear from the financial "fair play" rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 that PSW will eventually have to show that Nemar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona only paid Euro222 million ($262 million) to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Nemar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Nemar's move to France.
PSW can certainly split up to hire Neimar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team from the energy-rich, ruling Qatari family.
The clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the cost-effectiveness threshold in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after its election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success had in fact been cheated and at risk of collapse if banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on club debts and instead moved on to track their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then to spend a lot of time to improve the team and create a world brand - has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which is taking place in 2018, clubs may suffer a loss of 30 million euros.
And even though Platini was disgraced from his presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
"Of course, the FPF is alive, and we are moving forward to tighten the rules," said last week to the Associated Press, Andrea Traverso, who controls the FPF in UEFA.
Although PSW will pay for the purchase of Nemar's contract on a one-time basis, it may, for reporting, distribute this amount throughout its contract.
Nemar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on PSW as well as on Abu Dhabi's Manchester City.
PSW was fined Euro60 million (at the rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and was ordered to limit its team to the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may attempt to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with club owners.
Although a Qatari company could sponsor PSW, if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of PSW funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been increased.
It was reported that some of Naimar's earnings in PSW could have been paid by the organization committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSW and Qatar-2022 deny that Nemar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be found by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSW mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the situation reported that UEFA did not have a preliminary discussion with PSW on the Neimar transition.
They were in contact with the Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the "PSW" situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSW received more than 10 million euros at a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSW expects that Nemar's arrival will be a good ground for sponsorship, for the sale of attributes and for the team's logo T-shirts.
The club is expected to increase at least 30 per cent as a result of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish League tried to stop the Neimar tranphere, saying that PSW would break the financial "fair play."
"This is an obvious case of" financial doping, "with the club and the State," said the Spanish newspaper "AS," President of La League Javier Tebas, on the understanding that Qatar is the final owner of PSW.
Arsenala's coach, Arsen Winger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the club by the state.
"This is all the consequences of the share, and it has completely changed the football landscape over the last 15 years," Winger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is becoming very difficult to comply with the financial fair play because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will decide on the order and place of the oath.
Where and as new Russian citizens will be sworn in to the Russian Federation, the President will decide on such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State-building.
A week ago, the deputies were planning to define directly the procedure for taking an oath in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as those who are not able to do so, will be released from the solemn oath, as follows from the finalized text of the amendments to the draft law on Russian citizenship (available to the Committee on 11 July), which will be considered by the committee before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of taking an oath of office on entry into Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies have made this idea an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, which provides for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4, of the Criminal Code).
According to the draft law, his logic was that, by making documents for citizenship, a person signed under a promise to comply with Russian legislation - by taking the path of extremism, he was violating that promise.
In April, the draft law was submitted to the State Duma by the leaders of the Danube factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("One Russia"), Gennady Züganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinovsky (LDDP), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the Speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State-building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but it is now being redrafted.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the order of oath.
The parliamentarians had previously intended to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Citizenship of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State emblem and the flag of the Russian Federation, in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the draft law where such an event should take place - the list of places where the Russian Federation & apos; s emblem could be located is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of State bodies of entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
It could probably be the ZAGS.
A solemn oath will be made to those who wish to acquire Russian citizenship after the officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be received by a person once he has sworn in, following from a finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There was a rule that an oath would be released from an incapacitated or a limited working person, as well as from those who were unable to produce, read or sign by hand the text of the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release "other persons" from this procedure.
The updated draft also sets out a special procedure for the admission of Ukrainian citizens who are considered to be Russian-speaking.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting the relevant application to the competent Ukrainian authority.
A notarized copy of the statement would have to be provided to Russian officials.
The withdrawal of "alien" nationality will not be required, as it is now, if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not "for reasons beyond the control of the person."
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first Vice-Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonsky, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Irat Farrakhov (all "One Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is not real, just impossible.
Accordingly, very many people are waiting for a decision on their fate with regard to the citizenship of the Russian Federation, as explained earlier by the head of the Duma Committee for State-building and Legislation, Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had given up "other" nationality in writing and had given up their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, but "for reasons beyond its control" did not cease to consider him a national of another country.
It is now prohibited for foreigners to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or a residence permit of another country may not become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of Federation.
It is planned that the law will enter into force on 1 September 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws will be prepared.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective."
The current iteration of the history nostalgic also recalls the glorious days of characters in the 1980s; the era of grange in the 1990s (approximately at a time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schowalter made the "State" comedy for MTV); and themselves - that is, 2001, before its stars, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul and Paul Rudd, went to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems anachronistic.
The "first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, not just because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking tank of vegetables, which was spoken by H. John Benjamin).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority; this makes it a part of the joke that cannot return.
"Ten years later," where adults were already adults, they had less emotional roots, and its parody was more insystematic and included rhymes from the steel films of the 1990s, such as "A hand that was rocking the cradle."
In one episode, the character is given by Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
A lot of the story moves are the same.
Good Coop, now a writer, still has no reciprocity from Cathy (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not broken up with virginity.
And there's also a crazy and vicious conspiracy that Ronald Reagan (also Schowalter) is involved in, now being shot by George Bush, the eldest.
As always, the best part of the franchise is to step away from it.
It's particularly funny to see a young Rudd always singing Matt Dillon's song from "Lonely" whose character, Andy's former big man, looks old now.
The success of this franchise could be a random madness in the spirit of a recursive series, "Seven Up," until it comes to its logical conclusion, I think, "A hot American summer: 20 years later," where in the last stage, the whole company would go to a movie at the premiere of "A Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: the memory of the cold war from "Americans," "Explosive blond" or even "Bluska" with its East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gaytwood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Rizim Thomas, is a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s on two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - the one who saw Gregor's life and Joseph's idealist - are played by Florin Piersik, Jr., and Cornelio Ulić, and their English dialogues were presented by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitte.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only the idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spending time watching a chess game, how Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the frame - among them, Jenny Slater, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevinyi - makes it interesting to play "guess your voice."
But "Comrade Detective" is so holding on to the truth of the clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and funny is not very often.
If it were to be made shorter, Comrade Detective could better deal with his satira in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
The image of an imaginary communist audience says that Western culture can make a fuse of anything.
The invented Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and so do they.
The prize fund for the Russian Super Bowl football game between Spartacus and Lokomov is about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Prime League (ROPL), Sergei Thidkin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the RSFL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, and will report RT.
He also added that, to date, there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartacus-Lokomotive match will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9: 30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is an active champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Ufims have cleared the furniture shop for 200,000 roubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufimen, with a furniture firm, went to the police.
The man claimed that expensive tools had been stolen from the office, which had caused serious damage to its production.
The thief's production was a total of almost 200,000 roubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a swan.
The security guards began to search for the criminals and soon went to the inhabitants of the Bashkortostan blessed district, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service, the accomplices entered the enterprise, broke the front door and removed the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they got.
They have already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement officials have been able to return only some of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
State has commented on the words of Medvedev on the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States.
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of State Secretary Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the relations of the two States.
The head of the Russian government had previously stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
In commenting on these words, Naubert recognized that Russian-American relations were "low," but noted that "areas for interaction" should be sought.
"Look at the truce in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," the words of a diplomat of the RIA News.
However, the representative of the foreign policy agency refused to comment on the Russian Premier & apos; s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The new sanctions bill against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on the last Wednesday.
In doing so, he recognized that the document was a failure and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "raised" roses from Amethysts and quartz.
The jewellery unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillery - added to the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three coconuts on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has two new rings and a pendulum of Amethyst, pink quartz and diamonds made in glyptic (hand-held stone) and pavlov, which are devoted to the 70-year home.
The head of Dior Joaillery, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that had been growing a model, Christian Dior, in his estate in Granville, and by the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Cathelan.
Trump found those responsible for the deterioration of relations with Russia.
US President Donald Trump made a strong criticism of the members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an ever-low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the President wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement, in which he stated that the law would not allow the US to make profitable transactions and bring the Russian Federation, China and North Korea closer together.
The Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenia, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman's decision explained to the RBC the intention "to focus on other planned investments and projects that we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment in time," despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia was the main applicant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium, Grigory Guselnikov, and of the Belarusian company, Said Guzeriev, in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiary structures in March.
One such financial organization - in addition to the VTB and the External Economic Bank - became the Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blakat in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, the reason for the blakaut in Crimea was given.
The Chief of Department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of the situation.
He said that the peninsula had been left without electricity because of a road accident on the territory of Krasnodar province.
A truck that was hit by an accident hit the transmission line, resulting in the disconnection of Cuban and related Crimean networks.
The electricity supply of the major Crimean cities was disrupted last week.
The specialists corrected the malfunctions within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blakat could have been an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have led to rumours of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank & apos; s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) specialists voted with a result of 6 against 2 in favour of maintaining rates of 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of Committee members in favour of an increase this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly report on inflation, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that the rate increases in the next few years would be necessary to control the braces of inflation, and stated that it was likely that the cost of loans would have to be increased more than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago as a result of the braces.
As of next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan for which it provides low-cost loans to banks, although it has indicated that it is now to provide an additional £15 billion under the plan, up to £115 billion.
In the decision on rates, the bank said: "According to the main projections of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while the pressure on real household income continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that to stop inflation would require "some tightening of financial policies," a "slightly higher" amount than markets expected.
At present, markets are predicting a first increase in the third quarter of the following year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank & apos; s projections for an increase in this and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
After the news, the crunch fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to Euro1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent turbulent growth had weakened the growth expectations; then GDP had increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, up from 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it would start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank & apos; s last inflation report gave little cause for joy to households affected by high inflation and very little wage increases: the bank said that the pressure would increase before it fell.
The Bank added that the financial policy "cannot prevent" the impact on earnings in the next few years, but expects that wages "significantly" will recover by the end of its three-year projection.
The economy is also committed to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods, due to the low rate of pound, which offset part of the lower consumption costs.
The decision was taken one year after the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent last August after the shocking results of the EU withdrawal referendum, which had led to a fall in the pound.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on the rates, there was a growing noise around the expected rate increases, as inflation had increased pressure on already heavily pressured households: three of the experts on the committee had requested that the rates be raised to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and is being compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher than planned 2 per cent is the result of the low rate of pound.
Andrew Montlake, the director of Korea's Forecast Brokers, said, "In view of the recent decline in the rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and look forward to a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of credit, often with the possibility of a commission being absent, and with a low rate, is more popular than ever. "
The public health service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people.
Since September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV-prevention drug after a battle in the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection for persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 persons.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court & apos; s ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay for the PREP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called a "major innovation" by Simon Stevens, President of the National Health Service of England, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the programme all over England by April 2018, the venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more dispensaries will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course on HIV-related drugs used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
In the case of PREP, there are enough certain drugs before having sex in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken on a daily basis or at least two hours before sex.
The eligible patients are homosexual and bisexual men, transgender persons and people whose partners are positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
The Dessalonders will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not known to be held up by their HIV status as antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and are assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the near-venereal dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week, after an international procurement tender, signed a drug agreement.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of the PREP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorptive capacity and its use on a large scale.
"This critical innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the major health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is well targeted at people who need help and are at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with regard to the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at risk of HIV will have access to a new, new, new, new environment, which people can control without discussing with their partner, through a study carried out in England through the National Health Service, which will lead to an improvement in many or many lives.
We very much welcome this news. "
Jan Green, the president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said, "The first thing to do is to ensure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that no HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we have a PREP pilot, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. "
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said, "We very much welcome the start of the PREP test, it is very late because of months of delays and delays on the part of the Government."
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing and ending the transmission of HIV.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the PREP.
It is now important that the test be launched as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people at risk of HIV and to move us further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tatarstan and Russia Treaty
The Sixth Congress of the Tatar World Congress (WCL) adopted a resolution that noted the importance of maintaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a well-established form of organization of the highest State power in the Republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tartar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the division of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
It will be recalled that, since 24 July 2007, a 10-year treaty between Moscow and Kazan was concluded.
On 11 July, the members of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only federal entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one called the President.
In Russia, difficulties have been encountered in obtaining international driving rights.
There is a lack of international driving permits (MVM) in the GVBD units.
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacation persons who wish to travel abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights were contained in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights were recognized as such in the countries that had ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on a specific police or rental office: some require an IDP and some require national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers of international rights are still being granted, but it is worth taking into account that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all units of GIEACD, reporting to "Commerce," having conducted a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, the UGIDD units simply do not issue stamps, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can sign up for a public service reception, but it's a long line until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is not possible for the Ministry of Internal Affairs to obtain "for technical reasons," without any further details, in the Samara region, it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation is being created in other cities.
Many Moskvichi have already been in trouble, and social media are increasingly receiving such messages:
Irina Burmistrov: "Guess why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all of the HFCD's offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "The question to people who know!"
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, there is a long way forward, and there are no tickets at all at the place (there is a button, but there is no ticket).
It's like a public service portal shows that Spb's time is free for shit.
Did anyone try to get in another town?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permit forms have changed, and new forms are being delivered to the units of the State Inspectorate.
This may be linked to a deficit, but it is not clear which changes are being made, but it has not been previously reported.
Blanca buys the Special Centre for Road Safety (DHS) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplies them to the GIEACD units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with the Gozlav AO: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced, 15,000 were purchased in 2016, and 90,000 were purchased in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the First Print Court for the production of 70,000 forms.
There is a theory that the CSN just failed to hold a tender on time, which is why there's a deficit.
However, there are other options for a lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have started to travel on their own not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are being accepted there is not clear, so people are being overinsured, so there is an acute demand for international "crust."
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take an examination to confirm their qualifications.
The Mintrans made such a proposal.
The new international driving permit (IDP) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Pavel Petritenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said that in an interview with "The Witness."
No international company that respects itself will even put a bolt or a wiggle there, because it risks losing its business on EU territory, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"I mean, in my deep conviction, there is no prospect of this project," Petrico said.
He added that he believed that Russia was unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Nor can Russia normally build smaller-scale objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already been destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation - sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join the project," the official noted.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a set of road arches of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kercen Bank, a large-scale assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed, and its set will be locked at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the builders prepared for the installation of a railway arch on the fairway," they reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrance, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will link the Crimean Peninsula to the Krasnodar province.
In Spain, an official who had been out of work for 10 years was fired
What kind of angel patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of Spanish official Charles Recio have?
A permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
Mr. Recio was, however, dismissed.
But not by his direct supervisor.
What only happens in the world of bureaucrats.
Businesses seem to be used to all the "servants of the people" whores.
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, "sensation" is from Spain.
There, an archival officer, Valencia Carlos Recio, has been away from work for 10 years.
He was regularly paid.
And all the solid is 50,000 euros a year.
And so Mr. Recio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was fired by a decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
The investigation found that an evil hiker came to the office at 7: 00 every working morning to sign up for the electronic system.
And then I went home.
He showed up at the office at 4: 00 again to report back to the system that he had left.
It's been 10 years.
It also became known that the hiker spent all his free time drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate chief, who could not fail to know how to "actively work" in his place of work.
Judges are asked to protect against the President
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that their selection be introduced.
For courts of appeal and cassation, the Human Rights Council wishes to establish special districts that will not be linked to administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the Presidential Order.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the Human Rights Council on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, inter alia, individual cases of arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "I" of 9 December).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals, both on the independence of the judiciary and on the identification of judicial errors, on the financing of the courts and on legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit him for appointment without being entitled to refuse, as is now permitted by law.
It is also proposed that the President be denied the power to allocate cases to the judges.
To do so, experts allow, can be a specially written computer program.
The Human Rights Council also considers that the President is not entitled "to determine the results of the judge's qualification, to initiate disciplinary proceedings, and to decide on the establishment of additional material payments."
In doing so, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move on to "the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "give them a relatively short term of office, with a mandatory rotation."
All court presidents (from national to district) are now appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to reorganize the appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The HRC said that "it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts."
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have "judicial districts" which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are difficult to use "telephone law."
The Human Rights Court judges of the peace propose that people's assessors be strengthened to deal with certain "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"These are just our proposals," explained "I" by a member of the HRC, a judge of the Constitutional Court, retired by Tamar Morshyakov.
She also recalled that the President & apos; s assignment was not only for the HRC, but also for the Supreme Court (Supreme Court), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the Ministry of the Interior (among the co-perpetrators, the Office of the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) to carry out the task.
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of the independence of justice in the Russian Federation, the President of the Vyacheslav Lebedev of the WU is due until 1 September.
Living a high life: half-floor and smart design techniques have turned this little apartment into an open house in the Earl Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a long house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earl Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a beautiful model house, Queen Anna's style, and in favour of a new design, it says that Joan didn't pack his things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge in a much larger square," said Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment at the Earl Court, and there were such high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day. "
Since the first view, an apartment of 1,000 square feet has undergone complete reconstruction.
Originally, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and half-floor to get the best of the generous height of the ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my claim, "she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based Duck & Shed architectural and design studio to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a housing that would not only be a successful project but would be useful to Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to have two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where we could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creative to deal with the bridge.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We had to put the premises in such a way that they were one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to disable the structures so that they would be at the right height and allow for the use of the premises from above and from below. "
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-size rooms, one above the other in the space, and a lot more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vending copper light window from "Retrovius", the view of a sour living room is open below.
Mirror furniture with a gold cut, silver accent, and vintage lighting from Serge Moy are setting the project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, simplicity and light.
The short corridor is covered with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror security panel seems to be a window in the other room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all of Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can be built into the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the cooking.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a moving-up door like in a garage.
"This is where the engineering art was used," Erfan will be told about the armored steel of the wood-fibre shield door.
"It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
With reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
"In the end, the area of the floor is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate estimates," said Erfan.
"Slowly speaking, the real estate agent will come in and do the calculations based on the sex area."
Here, they have been able to increase the area of the sexes by using quality materials that give space the shade of luxury.
"The materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house," said Erfan.
"No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts. "
This is an indication that with good design and increased metering, an apartment can turn from something normal into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant decision is published on the Government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also draft a cultural policy strategy, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
A Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation has been appointed Chairman of the Commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries has been reduced to an eight-year minimum
Consumer price increases in G20 countries have been reduced to a minimum in the last eight years, reporting to The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent, lower in October 2009, when the price index was 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a 0.1% reduction in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
The rate of inflation in Russia is 4.1 per cent, according to the estimates of the Ministry of Health.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - according to this agency, the figure is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal transfer of the Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskaya, noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows the logging of the forest during the fire disposal, and the Government is planning to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be followed to ensure that the "cut-out" process did not take place.
Donskaya noted that the draft law involved monitoring by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the supervisory agencies.
Media: UWU members, in secret from the command, negotiate with the Donbas militia
A regular telephone service is established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbas.
The fighting parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The FSC and the Donbas militia have established cell phones in secret from their high command.
On 4 August, the country reported this, citing the members of the military operation in Donbas.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis by telephone.
Communication is not domestic: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements."
Such talks often result in a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists were aware of cases in which an officer had been congratulated on his birthday from the front line, from his official enemy.
The FEU and the NIR and LDP militias have been sitting in the trenches on the line of separation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbas.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs resented the blocking of the United Nations Security Council & apos; s allegations of attacks on the Russian Embassy.
The Russian foreign political agency is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the United Nations Joint Press Office condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The agency recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August, for the third time in a month, had been the subject of mortar fire by the terrorist groups Heyat Tahrir Al-Sham (former Jabhat al-Nusra, prohibited in the Russian Federation) and Faylak Al-Rahman.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the characterization of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that "it is clear that the Nusra attacks must be condemned by all, without any ambiguity or determination, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of the attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as the delegation of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine stressed, "for the third time in a month in the United Nations Security Council, the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft statement to the press condemning the terrorist attacks on Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital has been blocked, in turn, by the tone of the objections."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
"It is most reprehensible that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to engage in new provocations and acts of terrorism, gives them a sense of impunity," said in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of out-of-plan business checks.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, said that the number of non-planned business checks should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned ones, and said that it was necessary to limit the duration of the inspections to 10 days.
"Exclusive checks are generally carried out without appropriate agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent are agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office, everything else is on its own," cited by the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from taking away servers and hard drives from enterprises.
In addition, in the President & apos; s view, business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will make some progress in dealing with business-related or business-related cases," said the Head of State.
As reported by "I", the moratorium on planning checks has led to an increase in the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, at the request of the Russian President & apos; s Business Ombudsman, Boris Titov conducted a survey, which found that there had been a de facto replacement of planned checks with out-of-plan (the percentage of those who had encountered them had increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and checks on citizens & apos; applications (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More about the business tests on "I" material, the small business came from the other side.
The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million.
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million, 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
A former director of the Carlton football club and a developer, Colin de Lutis, lives in the Turac Palace three doors from his little brother Paul, who has filed a claim against him before the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still facing a violent divorce dispute.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 sites worth more than $half a billion that have been bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded a firm called Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and a list of the property of the De Lutis family today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and in Mount Buller and trade centres in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father of Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and the dominant person" of the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The distribution of property and money has become a stumbling stone for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed reconciliation attempts, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, in Paul's view, Colin excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but he accused Paul of incompetent management of certain facilities.
In the evidence given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are growing as snow: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have engaged the most famous lawyers, including the Royal Counsel, Allan Myers, and the best.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have been running milk bars and gastronomes, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They bought, under financial guarantees, a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last years of school, and Paul was a boy at the time (about 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis said that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me she didn't want the brothers to be tried," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis's group; Colin says that Mark got 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their secession."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to the 2015 edition of Eddie McGire, the best friend of the TV star.
The Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, a text message saying that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and have the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his statement that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not want to see me and Paul arguing in court," he said, "he added," still hopes for a solution to the conflict. "
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
"Our case will soon be decided by the court," Colleen wrote.
The new head of staff of Trump is planning to limit information to the President.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
Political reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news from the media, in the hope of keeping the Chief in a more calm state.
That's what the reporter Josh Dausie says.
"At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, with the leadership of the staff on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to address: the poor channels of information to the President."
Kelly told staff that information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the President would be better at making decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite true, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump down by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television was established a few decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be reconvinced," said "Political" Sam Nunberg, former electoral staff adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote at Polico that "according to six former members of the electoral staff, in order to control Trump's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the information that came to him personally had a constant flow of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting was ever "under control" was just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral staff know something we don't know - for example, if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets Trump didn't publish.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep Trump from putting oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Political" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of the councillors to constantly give the President questionable information.
This is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmaster:
"Trump's current and former staff say that Trump can respond very strongly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a copy of an article with GotNews.com, a website of the Internet-based provocator Charles C. Johnson, in which the Deputy Chief of Staff, Cathy Welsh, was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is always on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he has made false accusations and then renounced them.
Trump read the article and went to ask staff about Welsh. "
The Goldmaher adds that the then-head of the Rines Pribus and the Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of documents that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make the task of Kelly very difficult.
The prison prosecutor's office is fighting a HIV dissident.
The Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office challenged the decision of the Kalinin District Court of Tumen, which had dismissed the criminal case of a local resident who had a young daughter who had died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was a HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with her father.
The Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office is of the view that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tumen was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (indiscretion) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4.
According to the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office, the mother is herself HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," was explained at the Office of the Prosecutor of the Tumen Region.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalinin District Court of Tumen, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl made a request for this, explaining that "he has forgiven her wife, has no claims against her, she has made up for the damage and has made an apology."
The Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office did not accept the court & apos; s decision and filed an appeal, requesting that the decision to dismiss the case be overturned and that it be submitted for further consideration.
The girl died and the harm caused by the crime could not be remedied.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the child and treat her against a dangerous infection, "was reported to the press service of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the view of the supervisory body, it should be punished, or other HIV dissidents would follow.
According to the Toman AIDS Centre, some 12 HIV-positive children are currently not receiving medical care in Tumen province due to parents & apos; refusal.
"This situation has already improved - during the year of the special group, half of the parents who have categorically refused to treat children for HIV have changed their mind - allowed for diagnosis, started taking drugs," said the press secretary of the AIDS Centre, Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was not possible to influence parents by law, and not all HIV-positive children were able to be found to be unable to examine, hide and run away with children from hospitals.
What is the risk of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, the Peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV dissidents movement.
HIV dissidents are referred to as people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
The medical and AIDS-service workers of the NCB call these views anti-medical, and they see them as a serious threat.
The terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Grecana railway station in Hmelnitsk.
A merry company of young people who had been drinking was walking a bridge over the train, where the train was just standing.
One friend had an idea to make an effective selfie on the roof of the car, and had been told by FAKTAM in the police communications sector in Hmellnitsk region.
The guy started to get down from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion, he got into the power line and got an electrocution.
Fortunately, this case has become known to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called for an "emergency."
Prior to the arrival of the victim & apos; s doctors, they were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized at the burn unit of the Hmelnica Regional Clinic Hospital.
A man's body burns were diagnosed with 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now being assessed as stable.
Law enforcement recalls that, in recent times, extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storey, bridges moving transport have become more popular.
The police call on people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed the oceans to exist on ancient Venus.
There could be oceans on ancient Venus.
The French scientists made such a suggestion.
The specialists created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the planet's surface, and wrote Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of her history, Venus had oceans that had 10% more water than it was now on Earth.
Previously, "The Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the theory of scientists, the ocean could have been on Mars 4 billion years ago.
In the course of their studies, foreign experts concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red World.
Three people were injured in the shooting in the park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting and transferred to Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a significant number of visitors were present.
According to witnesses, a number of men on the bridge began to scream threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the culprits could not be considered, as they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was provided with medical treatment, after which he was released.
The third injured is a minor, and there are no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
A number of other visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
The Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul.
The Louna rock band concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album, "The Great New World," which is one of the most expected releases of the year.
The team is preparing a conceptual show that will be the most vivid in the band's concert history.
"A Great New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is linked to the known novel-antiutopia of the O.Haxley "On a Great New World."
The new songs do not rewrite the book, but rather talk about a society that lives under the law of anti-utopia, "blind faith in propaganda and imposed values."
The team was helped to collect money to record the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Louna released his first album, "Do it louder!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the record "Time X" and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna made a symphony band at Crocus City Hall with the "Song of Peace" programme.
As part of the group of Lucine Gevorkian (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkretyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzburg (drums).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul Club "Fir" on October 17, 19.00.
The price of tickets is between 1,200 and 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the wanted groups on the Russian rock stage.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut was held in 2009.
The Group has won several times in different nominations for the "damn Dujina" hit parade.
The Gypsies have overcome the rails and returned to the "Millionaire Street."
Some of the most wealthy West Midland homeowners are once again in conflict with the strong Roma who have overcome the fenced by the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field near their homes.
The Gypsies have parked 20 houses on wheels in a field that borders on a rich Solihall street, which has been called "Millionaire Street."
When they brought horses, babies and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they had been expelled no further than in May, and they were not prevented from digging up by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical company found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed its vehicles through a section that was left unsecured to leave a space for the path.
The dissidents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that it was "unable to solve the problem."
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here this evening on Monday, after being kicked out of Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones at passers."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they were completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were kicked out, and now they're back.
Last night, more gypsies arrived, and today, perhaps more.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Stritsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it. "
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and this attack, please, is continuing."
This time, there were more of them, and we even saw a horse on the meadow. "
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: "We know of an illegal camp on land near Stritsbrook Road and are cooperating with the Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to run them away as soon as possible."
In order to help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This provides an understanding of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
The new light is the new-light champagne plant.
The Government of the Republic of Crimea "The New Light Champagne Wine Plant" has decided to take action by converting the New Light Champagne Wine Plant into the KLA, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crim Anna Anyuhina.
100 per cent of the shares of the enterprise will remain in the State ownership of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the equity society will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares at a nominal cost of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if no funds were available for the next three years for the modernization of the plant, there would be a threat of stopping the plant.
The output of the plant & apos; s fixed assets is between 60 and 70 per cent.
The upgrading of an enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles. Because of the nature of the institutional and legal form, it is required to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, to talk about borrowing from large credit organizations is difficult," said the chief of the Mingelhobe of Crimea, Sergei Petelin, in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the projected privatization plan for 2017
It was suggested that it be put into action and put on a bid.
Interfax's source in the Crimea authorities estimated the possible cost of selling an enterprise of $40 million, and the investor's investment in modernization of another $30 million.
In 2016, the "New Light" increased the production of playing wine by 2.8% from the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a plant for the production of the playful wine in the new light that he had acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The lower-city third-class men have destroyed more than 40 tombs.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs staff of the Lower Urban Region have identified the citizens who have destroyed 46 tombs in the cemetery of the city of Liskovo.
The perpetrators were third-class students.
The first statement that the grave stoves had been damaged by the unknown was received by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Lyskov region on 27 June.
A total of 24 persons have approached the police in this regard.
As a result, criminal proceedings were initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code, "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects and found them to be two children aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching monuments fall, and that led them to hooliganism.
Prevention measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone towards the ships of NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they were subject to the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue," said the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minnia, in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper "Stampa."
A warning from the Ministry was given the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that his crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had been working for only a year, had refused to comment on the substance of the detailed allegations made against it by the Italian prosecutor, Ambrojo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone," a statement by the organization on social media.
"We will only be able to assess all the charges put forward now after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken all the lifeboats on board migrants who were sent directly to them by traffickers and of allowing smugglers to go with the boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the prosecution file, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control the rescue operations in the area, from a humanitarian rage rather than on any other grounds.
The Code of Conduct provides, primarily, that the Yuventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Pro-Activa Distributed Enclosures from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided that they did not cause any "significant changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also a Nobel Prize-winning organization, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).
In the meantime, Minnia said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly increased their policy on the Libyan track and, with visits to Moscow, have been a part of the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Les Dengos, told "I" what the objectives are for Moscow in the region and who is betting.
The contact group on Libya, which you are leading, is largely unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows about it.
And here is a veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are under the supervision of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mikhail Bogdanov, and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of the Duma for Chechnya. - "I").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The result of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, 11 persons were on board. - "I").
We were thinking about helping the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts from the State Duma was established and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to lead the work of the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of seamen from the Mechanic of Chebotarev.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and on the part of Tripoli (where the United Nations-recognized Government, headed by Faism Saradj, is based), and with Tubrok (a residence of Parliament that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya. - "I.").
With the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice-Prime Libya - "I"), we have been able to quickly agree on the release of Russian seamen.
It was then decided that a contact group would be established to make better use of those contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, but we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many are in Libya all the time?
The contact group is now composed of five persons.
Among them are people with experience in the security sector, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include representatives of the Middle East Institute of RAN in the regional team of specialists.
There is no permanent presence of any of our staff in Libya, which is not yet necessary.
Are there any Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, whose side is it?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group has ex-military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed cities as Misurata (where the militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of the Libyan leader, Muammar Qaddafi, in 2011, and have been significantly increased in the years to come.
We came to Misurata in January this year.
We were scared, told there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to look at the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there is such rumours as the role of Islamists.
In Misurat, we met with all the members of the forces that were involved in the destruction of the IH in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken from the Russian-prohibited "Islamic State" - "I").
We wanted to see them, meet these people, check out the information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of the EG in Libya, not the Khalif Haftar, who attributed these things to himself.
And what is your conclusion?
The "Islamic State" in Libya did not win Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was operating on a different front in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, there were structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we have invited to Russia the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation received a visit from the Council of the Federation, Duma, Mida and Rosgwardy.
You, as we understand it, are present in all Libyan regions and are likely to represent the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Fayz Saraj?
Or, again, as has been the case on many occasions in the past, agreements will be broken, fighting will resume, and the parties will try to take power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting has already been a good signal to us, and it has not been possible for so long.
In the recent past, both leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We were confronted with this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board a Russian aircraft carrier, Admiral Kuznetsov, that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they didn't believe it.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian, if he does, it's very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they reach Russia, and they have some nostalgia on it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
We are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not want to weapon some to the detriment of others.
We would like all to be in some equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyan people for Russia to help in any way to lift it.
The constitution-making process is now under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and an internal consensus will be reached.
The elections should then be held, as was also the case at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and no party now has such status), the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations Joint House.
To raise this issue now is meaningless and dangerous, but it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
In the media the other day, it was reported that Italy, which had been faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow, in this situation, help Italian partners, using their ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar forces will control the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants into Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're working on it.
The Italians need support from Russia because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue with both Haftar and Saradj and Misurata and the south.
In that regard, the tribes in southern Libya played a major role, and they were ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it a question that the South should stop the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
So, on the contrary, they were turning back the buses that were driving Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saradj.
The head of Government in Tripoli, Fayz Saraj, is considered an Islamist who supports the introduction of sharia norms in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll make my personal opinion on him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, opposed to radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself is of the view that Libya must be a completely normal country - a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, with legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards and started working with both Tripoli and Truck.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosoil has concluded a cooperation agreement with the State-owned oil company of Libya, NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosoil's head Igor Sachin made a deal, himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosoil took place.
What will Russia do to her?
I guess I'll resell it.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
In plans to resign the contracts concluded at Muammar Qadhafi.
These include, inter alia, previous transport arrangements (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, is the oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is, I don't do these questions directly.
In fact, the economy is not the main thing for Russia in Libya.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping.
The important thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to reach an agreement between themselves so that they can establish order and Libya will no longer be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task: to help the Libyan people and to remove terrorists from it.
Do you have any information on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, no Russian and other countries from the former USSR were there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records from Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. "I") and the Russian speech did not sound there.
And from which States, then, are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then we'll put it another way.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans, not more than 5 per cent of them.
The rest are sent.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our readiness to come back to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such a negotiation go on?
It's hard to say right now.
Several more visits are still to be undertaken, and I hope that it will be clear about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Chechen museum, the charities raised money for a expensive gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matzola, who has a DTP, a brain hydrocephalus and a complete blindness, will be given a special track on 5 August in the Melihovo Museum.
Sasha, Minister of Culture of the Moscow region, Oksana Kosarev, and Director of the Constantin Bobkov Museum, will present a useful priest.
The money for the trainer was collected during the "Do not get tired of doing good" charity, which was held in Melihov on July 15, Day of Chekhov's Remembrance.
The day before, a marathon in the museum received a letter from Sasha, living in the village of Manuskina of the Chekhov district, saying, "I have no eyes, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would very much like to have a run-in to make my feet strong, and I would have learned a little bit to walk."
And so, Sachin's dream came true!
The "Concert-Post-Script" will be held in the museum reserve, followed by a well-known pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, who will perform the priors of popular classical works.
During the Charitable Marathon in Melihov, the Ascenic Dauvnaya Pushni choir, the call for a workshop by Ili Drozdihin, the students of the P. I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesinov, and the artists of the "Chekhov Studio" of the Melikhov Theatre were speaking.
There were auctions for visitors, a book fair and a charitable sale of gift products with a marathon logo.
The Melihovo Conservative Museum took the initiative to make Chekov Day a single day of charity on 15 July in all the Podmoskovya Museum.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zitomir oblast, near the local football stadium, fired several shots at the young people there.
According to the suspect, he was made angry by the noise, and was informed by FAKTAM in the communication department of the Zitomir district police.
The man then entered a café in the vicinity.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of his visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there was no threat to his life.
The police and the ambulance had arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
A man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet shot-off device that's been sent for a test.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is subject to three to seven years & apos; imprisonment.
We will recall that a shooting attack took place in Kiev on Lukianovka in the area of Tatarsky Street on the night of 28 July.
Michelle Carter's sentence for reports that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years & apos; imprisonment for being forced, through text messages and phone calls, to kill her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months in prison and five more years in probation.
In June, Carter was found guilty of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is killed with grief.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy were both mentally ill.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, holding his hands tight and putting his eyes down.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She did not accept responsibility, "she said.
"She did not show remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant impact on her actions."
The Prosecutor read the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother, saying, "It's not been a day since I would have mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I do it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever, "he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was inexcusable about the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"To lose a man who has been with me ever since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of her life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would make a person responsible for the advice to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with signs of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case brought to the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just need to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death, and she was not allowed to talk to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing his British apartment roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published his separate opinion at the Los Angeles Times, saying, "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players of the WTB Single League is a 33-year-old Keith Langford who left UNIX.
The departure of the United States defence counsel, "News," was commented by the President of UNICS, Yevgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons at UNIS and showed a high level in each match, reaching 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family and career.
Kit Langford won three years at the club, winning silver from the One League 2015 / 16.
In the 2016-17 season, he received a award from the most successful Euroleague player.
He scored 21.75 points per game on average.
This is the second result since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague's history to receive the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, informing Eurohoops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroleague in July, moving to the Chinese championship.
Previously, he moved to the Chinese CBA to the ex-centric "Panathinakos" by Yannis Burusis.
A sun-burning tourist from Podoskovya was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigei
Adigean rescue workers today evacuated from the mountainous area of the Republic a ripple tourist who received the most severe solar burns.
The man was on vacation at the Fiste shelter at an altitude of 1.6 m.
A 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure and had also had difficulty breathing.
A preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The team leader addressed the rescue team, who said that the man had been burned while on a camping trip.
Audi has to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW stated that it would be proposed to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman stated that the company considered that "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where "BMW" is located - which considered the possibility of prohibiting or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler stated on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their step a withdrawal.
European automotive manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that release diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to vehicle manufacturers of equipment that neutralizes the exhaust of diesel vehicles is also increasing, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for vehicles.
While German automotive manufacturers are under close consideration, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of being a havoc to powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the Volkswagen mistakes, which have hidden the use of so-called "damage devices," which during testing could control the amount of harmful gas emitted to comply with the rules and have been deactivated under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders have been convicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, Germany arrested a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of "Audi" in the investigation could create serious problems for "Folkswagen": the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of a disproportionate share of the income of "Folkswagen."
In Astrakhani, a visitor to the café paid off with false money.
The police received a report from an employee of the bank & apos; s office that a suspicious purchase of 5,000 roubles had been found in the calculation of money from the general-purpose point.
A study conducted at the Forensic Centre found it to be false.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Astrakhan province, one of the visitors to the café who bought the shaurma was paid in a bankrupt manner.
It is worth noting that the cash account was not equipped with an authentication instrument.
The police are currently establishing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a well-known false ticket from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years & apos; imprisonment, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the inhabitants of the Astrahan region to be careful when carrying out financial transactions; it is recommended that trade workers establish instruments to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
The astronomers have found a "hell" planet that can even melt iron.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics was very surprised at its temperature, which could evaporate iron and other metals.
The experts noted that the water molecules are so warmed by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope has captured the glow of the water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow in the infrared range.
The WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot jupiter" - gas giants, by size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located 10 times closer to the parent star.
As a result, the exo-planet has only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas cover is inflated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of the dry weather and the disease-borne insects; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Ches, an expert from the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPAM, said: "The lavender in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years the plant has been affected by climate change: the rain has been much lower in the spring and especially in the autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
And there are small cicades that jump through the leaves, insects that carry micro-bacteria; very dry weather makes them very many. "
There's a lot at stake.
Lavanda's not only attracted to vacation workers; lavender oil is very needed in perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or not at all.
That's why we have less parts that contain euphemic oil. "
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and reducing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and extracting more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador Winter Univerada-2019 met with the Krasnoyarsk students
The two-time World Hockey Champion, the Ambassador of Winter Unverada-2019, Alexander Semin, met with the start-up hockey and gave autographs to the cheerleaders the previous day.
The meeting was held in the Winter Unverada-2019, as part of a thematic week devoted to the hockey with the Seiba.
Any man in the tent could have been on the skates on a set of artificial ice.
In addition, a series of estafetes, crictorines and games have been organized to play the gift-playing activities of the student games and to break up with the Federation of Aerobics.
The event was attended by 50 students.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to study as much as possible on sports sites and stressed that the most important in the initial stage of education was hard work and a great desire to engage in hockey.
"It's great that there's a site in Krasnoyarsk, like the Winter Unverade-2019, where start-up athletes can ask team coaches directly," said the champion.
We note that the Ambassadors of the Winter Univerade-2019 are helping to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among the Krasnoyarans.
The Univerade Shater will be operational throughout the summer season until September 25, 2011, and will be reported to the press service of the Winter Univerada 2019.
In the State Department, they commented on the words of Medvedev.
The official representative of the United States Department of State, Heather Nauert, commented on the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's briefing and stated that there was a need to find a "area for interaction" with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to "improve bilateral interaction."
An example of such successful cooperation was the Armistice Agreement for Syria.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, it has the right of course to speak, but I can't say more about it," said the representative of State.
Previously, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten the sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on a new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the American hysteria "has won" Trump.
A missing bodibilder was found on an alien & apos; s memory loss.
Bodibilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very high-profile circumstances, leaving the car's parlor to go to the bathroom.
Seven days without success, the people who knew him and the people who lived there were looking for him.
And there was Shamil on someone else's date in Ramensky.
He was found completely naked in his bathroom by the owner.
A Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
The identification of his missing persons helped to identify him.
The medical examiners who arrived on call recorded a partial memory loss and a brain injury from Hanmetov, reporting the Mash pavilic.
The athletes are probably waiting for other surprises.
The perpetrators who abducted Shamil were probably already in his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
The oil and gas revenues of July exceeded the projection by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received as a result of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by Rs. 7.4 billion, as reported by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was due mainly to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the rouble than the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as to the higher actual production of gas and the export of oil products at projected levels.
"The deviation of the federal oil and gas revenues from the monthly estimate, in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act for 2017-2019, is projected at + 40.2 billion roubles in August 2017," a communication from the Ministry of Health.
Thus, the total amount of foreign exchange in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is $47.6 billion.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Each working day during this period, the ECB will enter into foreign exchange transactions at the Moscow Exchange, organized by a tender, equally during the day of trade.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly newspaper Riodose usually meets on Wednesday to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the State of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, given their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: to take the children with them to an office where they had already been thrown at a grenade in 2009 or to leave them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to give names for each column - evidence is not necessary, suspicion and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a list of the scoundrel, which makes it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
Violence is not a problem, and more and more journalists are being found to be in the body that is growing in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven states this year.
Among the latter are their publisher and envoy, the co-founder of the Riodos, Javier Valdes Cárdenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," he wrote Valdes in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is widespread - a large picture of Valdes showing his average finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodos building; two reporters in the 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smile, face in points or his company panama.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor & apos; s office had been established in 2010 to investigate journalists & apos; cases, only two cases had been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized crime-related killings committed each year, journalists & apos; killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed with grief, although it is now more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talk at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of Riodose in the capital, Culiacane.
He was only able to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was taken out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "The 12th River."
The shooter left in his car and broke it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumor usually goes fast on the Kulyakan.
But almost everyone talks about Valdes.
Since Gusman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody fields of battle in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-storey mausoleum of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that "calm" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the overseas state with important ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
In spite of this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of the Riodos, is being blamed for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was a result of two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions who is fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have pissed off the sons; the people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper had been captured, which had written the same story.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste, and in 2003, with five colleagues, he founded Riodos, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without addressing the drug issue," said Bohorkes.
Over time, the newspaper has earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising income.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that they could read in that publication about what no one else had ever dared to write.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodos received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Prize for Reporter's Work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for the courage to investigate drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He made a clear confession that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the tasks that you're facing as a journalist or you're just being a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodos' staff miss Valdes, a joker who's been fighting like a port loader, a friend, a generous hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to get back alive.
They relied on the order they had set up.
He should have always worn his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, a bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, was he destroyed by the love of one established order?
His death also made them question their calculations of how best to do his job and remain alive.
"They don't like you to know their wives, their children, their legal business, and their underground airfields for the transport of drugs.
"These things were below the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even at better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Stay away from something that smells bad.
The problem is, the editor of the Riodos, Andrés Villareal, says that "the smell can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier is happening."
The old rules, he said and others, no longer applied in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there was a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
The Landshaft is changing all the time.
In the room where Riodose staff had gathered for security training, it had suddenly been prohibited to enter cell phones: a few days earlier, it had become known that spy programmes, which were being sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
There are two police officers outside in the shadow of a tree from a 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were instructed by the State Government to protect the office of Riodoza, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Kulyakana.
Some journalists asked if those police officers were part of the 50 per cent of the law enforcement officers that the Governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the near room, Riodos had three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of a former boxing champion, Julio Cesar Chávez.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the Governor & apos; s home city.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakana, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was abducted or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time as drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that a restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling institution-revolutionary party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for almost the last century.
A number of PRI governors have recently been charged with high-profile corruption.
He asked the journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo, Guzman, escaped from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdes' column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened before," said the 46-year-old Villareal, for his thin body, called "El Flako."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdes' office is now used as a poster and sticker warehouse with protests against the killing of journalists, because staff have become what they never thought they would be: press activists.
A journalist, Miriam Ramírez, took several posters and went to a local prosecutor's office on the following morning for a demonstration on another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the State of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, on the basis of DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak out louder, to organize protests and to write "SOS Press" on the pavements and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, trying to secure international support for the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramírez, the authorities were accused of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then requested that no more tasks be given to her to cover the activities of the Government, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the Government and a society of no diversity.
In his last book, "Drug Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not killed by just gangs of drug traffickers; they did so on orders from politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on orders from the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you're dying because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
They found a note on her body, allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close down as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on to El Maniana from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through an editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and they continue to find danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risk-based solutions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of Riodoza were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones were called at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 bodies, as confirmed.
The war continued to spread, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
When they were on the sidewalk, they put the news on the Riodos website through their mobile phone.
The next day, we had to redo the first page.
The sirens were taken near, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
While sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose average finger was placed on the sight of the whole Sinaloa, the Riodoza staff continued his case.
"How can you think of closing up," said Bohorkes, "if the same day Javier was killed, the practical girl asked me to send her out to the street to do a report?"
The dinosaur used a camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, he seems like a statue, even though he is a source of terror.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature of rhino size found by a Canadian miner were so good that the experts called it "Mona Liza among dinosaurs."
It was so good that they were even able to determine that the colour of his cherry skin was red-brown, and to say that he had, in some ways, a dark past.
In a report published in "Modern biology," it was described as "the most well-preserved from Tyreofort in the history of the found and one of the best copies of the dinosaur in the world."
It's a fossil, a recently found copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of a small period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good state has been stunned by researchers who call it "really great."
This herb tyreophore is the most well-preserved fossil of this species in the history of the found, according to the articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Milenium mine of Sancor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding species, and decided to look more carefully.
His found fossil was sent to the Royal Tirrellov Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work has been done on the detection of an animal within a 2,500-pound earth-bed (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the result can be demonstrated.
"It's just a little bit of a feeling, and it's almost possible to believe that he's sleeping," said the lead author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrellov Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being shown.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved copies of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was a herb, even though it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, that was likely to have been at considerable risk from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful dinosaur has used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and has used protective equipment known as the protective colour that many animals of our days also use.
This would allow him to become more comfortable with the environment and avoid meeting with his enemies, as the experts say, assuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, at the age of 110 million, belonging to the nodosaurus family, was widely covered in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrellov Paleontological Museum.
The scientists have already studied the animal and given him the name Borealopelta Markmitchelli, after a museum laboratory, Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours in his sterile excavation.
The remarkable preservation of the copy made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the garlic and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective colouring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the safety color is very common, the discovery became a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much higher than the size of the current living animals with a protective colour.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur has been so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution has preferred the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colours - for example, reindeer, zebra or bronze - are much smaller and more accessible, indicating that the nodosaurus has had to fight for survival.
"The serious threat from the predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Chalk Period were," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur is also an indication that its skin should have been red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned and his back down on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far further into the land than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is indeed remarkable that it is fully covered by the remaining cherry skin, and at the same time it is fully preserved in three dimensions, while preserving the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the early little period.
You don't have to use imagination to recreate it, you just have to feel a little bit, and you can almost believe he's sleeping. "
The small period is an era when gigantic teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two feet, rode the Earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his great ancestors could have been hunted for tireform.
These include an acrocanzar, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 metres), with a weight of six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in "Modern Biology" magazine believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mummified in the iel.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he was working at the Milenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, it is the most well-preserved tyreophore in the world, with skin and shell, and it is intact, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures were about 18 feet (5 metres) long, weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
They were characterized by two 20-inch spikes from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herb tyreophore has been very hard on what is now Canada, until the split river took it to the open sea.
But the submarine's dinosaur burial kept his shell exactly to the smallest detail.
The infested remains of this particular copy have been so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the brown shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresco wrote in the National Geographic magazine article, the degree of security is rare as a lottery win.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The camered skin remains still cover the buggy shell plates that sever the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, his five fingers are up.
I can count the pieces on his head. "
Mikhailu Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without a document.
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by a Polish publication, Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of him on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili took part in an event to celebrate the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against the Hitler forces in 1944.
As a politician did not know Polish, although he had tried to speak that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
In his speech, the politician addressed the topic of Georgia & apos; s cooperation with Poland, as well as Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian migration service had deprived him of his nationality had been learned by a dangerous politician while in the United States.
It is not yet known how he has managed to carry out a non-documented transatlantic flight.
The former Governor of Odessa oblast, Mikhail Saakashvili, had previously stated that his signature on a questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
The investigation in the case of Wainziher and Olhovik has been extended until January
The preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group, Yevgenia Olhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Weinziher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Court of Basmane is considering the extension of the house arrest of the accused.
The UK representative at the meeting reported on the last decision to extend the period of the preliminary investigation.
"The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to remove and carry out a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigations in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects had regularly given bribes to Komi's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Wainziher, Olhovik, as well as the former head of the Integrated Energy Systems, Mikhail Sloboone, who had been head of the company Vompelk until 5 September, had given bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi for establishing the most favourable heat and electricity tariffs, as well as for creating an enabling business environment.
Wainziher and Olhovik were detained, taped in Sicktyvakar and arrested for two months, Slobol escaped from the investigation and was declared a federal search.
How did one activist know the answer to "Whose Street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the bottom of his soul.
Just a day after his arrival in New York as part of a tourist trip, St. Louis's student was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at a Facebook tape on his phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
After noting that no one else in her tape had written that information, the puzzled, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
In her tape, there were a lot of user outposts with an e-mail @ Theopharah.
Roper from Grand St. Louis, on real time, tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's dead body, spread out in the street, where it would be for four hours.
"It's wild," thought Ferrell.
But death was not something new for her and her circle.
She put the phone back, and then she went back to the tweets later that Candfield Drive had people on it.
There were photos of a radio tape and screaming people and a man who said he was Brown's father holding a poster saying, "A police officer from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and said, "I will kill you all... animals!"
"It's not a standard situation," according to his own memories, then Ferrell said.
"It's not a murder like those we're used to, which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a little cold.
I was angry and crying. "
She took a flight back and went home the next day.
When she landed at 11: 00, she took her six-year-old from her father's house and decided that they were both going to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years was the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Street?," which will be released on the screen on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and on the streets, asking for answers.
While Ferrell was on his way to Ferguson with his daughter, wearing a flower dress and a wreath in colour, they remembered a conversation that had been held countless times before this morning, "about the experience of black people and their situation."
She remembers saying, "Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong. "
"I couldn't help but take her," said Ferrell later.
"What's going on today is the culmination of what's happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
It must not only have a good understanding of activism and organization, but also an understanding of the different levels of black experience and their situation, and what we must do to become free to free.
Even if I could provide her with an environment in which she would not face obvious racism herself, she was no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had kept her from it. "
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florida Road, a site across the street from a police station that was some kind of tent camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of the final non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was making lunch bags.
They were collecting bags and helping to give them to the protesters.
A little bit of Ferrell's mind has taken the form of a new type of activism.
"My activism has changed completely since 9 August," she said, noting that, as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Association of Nursing Students from National Minorities and was involved in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of the organizer.
It came by itself. "
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabah Folayan, one of his co-directors.
Folayan said she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado-Farre, just wanted to document "events."
The question is, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story you can play?"
This scepticism has been marked by many people, often white, who have come to the community to benefit from his pain and steadfastness.
As was explained in a recent interview by Folayan, "We have heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and we want to do it differently."
By then, the Folian had already joined with his co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his campaign on death row issues.
His involvement has been a source of sympathy for the project with Ferrell and six other local residents with whom the "Whose Street" team has been in contact for years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, it's not someone talking for us or us, it's us talking," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing for me, how these people will be represented, because it is how I will be represented."
While the project was not intended to focus on the experience of Ferrell - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community is united," as the Folian said, it was the most open-ended of the film.
As a result, "Whose Street?" shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time he saw the product.
"But I realized that when you do this job and you make the black people human, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, the history of Ferrell is again discussing and emphasizing the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of "The life of blacks is important."
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the tag # BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Travon Martin in 2012 - have identified themselves as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement," said Ferrell. "And all because we fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
The Folayan accepted this claim, noting that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and many homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "it is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrell was not elected as the central character of the film because of her distinctive characteristics.
"She was the man who was awakening that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was on the front line, because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen. "
In the meantime, Ferguson has long had no cameras, but there are complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on trial for two and a half years for closing off the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place called the house just "the mess."
She's still holding on to the reading she learned when she went to Ferguson Street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
Two Salvadorian football players were disqualified for the bite of US players.
El Salvador's football team Henry Romero and Darwin Ceren have received long-term disqualification for non-sporting behaviour.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of North and Central American and Caribbean Football Confederations (CONCACAF), the Salvadorans bitten American players.
Henry Romero's lawyer was the first to be distinguished.
The Salvatore bit the attacker, Josie Altidor, then pinned him by the chest.
Then Ceren's half-protector, while serving a corner in his fine area, bitten US defence counsel Omar González.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with an American victory of 2: 0, passing on Goal.com.
The appearance of similarity: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA.
In the middle of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces, white, black and brown, are hanging from the ceiling on the wire, all of which are intractable.
These 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Harborg from the cheek and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent a line from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which broke on August 2, is called "The emergence of resemblance."
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art brings together technology, informatics and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident, to whom Barack Obama reduced his sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analysed the DNA from Manning and used it to create three-dimensional portraits of people with such genome, Dewey-Harborg has created a deep, although difficult, manifesto understand not only the plastic nature of the DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from a young man's age was openly saying that he considered himself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the espionage act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: a grains black and white selfie, where Manning in a platinum-haired wig, who clearly felt uncomfortable, was driving a car; and she was associated with that picture.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg completed his 2012 project "The Visions of strangers."
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people, using court evidence such as pickles and gum, removing DNA from this garbage and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary show of a new press exhibition.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait from her DNA.
Thus, in an unusual way, the artist and her muse in prison became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of "Painted Pictures," illustrated by Showey Canungo, who had shown how the president would reduce Chelsea's punishment in the future and would be able to attend the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong about the show opening right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and inventing new ways to make Twitter a feud that he's supposed to soften.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about a time-bound match, she said that "by accident, nothing happens."
In a statement by an artist on the wall of the gallery, the great signature of Manning at the bottom (with a heart over "i" in her name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the other side, her mitochondrial DNA, long caterpillar C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is scientifically well-known), Dewey-Harborg was hoping to show how we all are remarkably similar, in any case in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video "False Memory" is also displayed here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibit in the same room is the novel mentioned above in the comic books.
It has a King Kong-style Manning over the United States Correctional Carm building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they'll win," it says there.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," said the artist who welcomed us from Philadelphia.
"I still have a sour in my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibit in person - as it was visibly shown in the comic books - but when she comes, she will be welcomed by the masks in the centre of the room, her own genome simulations, gathered together as a crowd of protesters.
It's also done deliberately, like everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5 "2, Manning's Growth), where the pencil was drawn by genetic hedge groups.
"I used to have them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, as a movement that was also behind its release."
A professor at the North West University and a staff member at the University of Oxford are looking for police on murder charges.
According to the police, there is a national raid on a professor at the North West University and a staff member at the University of Oxford who are being wanted as suspects because a luxury room in Chicago has found a man who has been stabbed to death.
According to the Cook District Court records, on Monday, detention warrants were issued for a premeditated murder without a right to bail of 40-year-old Windham Latvia and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duralo.
According to documents, a 20-year-old Cornell-Durranlo died after being injured multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, came to the Grand Plaza compound and found a victim with several injuries on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Durranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now the detectives are investigating death from stab wounds, considering her a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latvia has held the position of Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North West, since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latvia was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to visit the North West University campus.
"This is a criminal case now being investigated by the authorized persons and the North West University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigation authorities."
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to give up.
The head of the Chicago Police Liaison Office, Anthony Gullielmi, said that he very much advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing," Gulliemi said.
According to Guljelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Guljelmi, the police officer was called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police said the crime scene was terrible.
Gullielmi reported that it was not clear whether the incident itself had taken place on 27 July.
According to him, the video shows that Latvia and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latvia and the victim were connected," said Gulliemi.
The Grand Plaza guidelines issued a call to the residents, which said: "The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Vice-Prime Muko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future."
Russian Vice-Prime Vitaly Muko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RASADA) would be implemented shortly.
"A certain stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests with UKAD (the British Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly, "said Muko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map for re-establishing compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the RISADA and was recently published on the organization & apos; s website.
According to Muko, it does not contain anything that would be difficult for Russia.
"It's all been announced, it's all going to be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA as soon as possible, "he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list is that Russian andidoping structures should publicly accept the results of an investigation commissioned by the WADA by a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in a Russian sport was State-controlled.
On this issue, Muko said, "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit what was not... "
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication Rsport, Smirnov recognized the problems that had previously occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to adopt this report without a reservation, "added Smirnov.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow office in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Nyggli, stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" towards the re-establishment of its work.
A fire was required at a 79-story tower in Dubai.
The major fire that took place in one of the highest residential buildings in the world, The Torch tower, is put out, is being passed on by Reuters.
It is noted that the fire extinguishers have been able to cope with all fire sites by 4: 00 local time (3: 00 msk).
The local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
During the fire-fighting period, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for this are not yet known.
It was previously reported that 79-storey living skyscraper The Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was on fire in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated on time.
The unimaginable outfit of the Buzov has shocked fans: pants that don't cover their pants.
Olga Buzova's Scandal Reality Reality Show "House 2" struck the Europa Plus Live in his panties.
In front of thousands of fans, the new duet singer from Nausti Kudri performed a song called "We'll be Hot."
Both girls went on stage in provocative "trousers," sewed in such a way that the lower underwear of the singer appeared to be in sight.
Buzova and Kudry were written on their trousers.
It was previously reported that a specialist from one of the Moscow Plastic Surgery Clinic had commented on the changes in the appearance of Buzova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia.
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 News Service reported this with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO gensek also criticized Russia for the situation of Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was possible and that further escalation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that the relationship between the US and Russia was at a dangerous low level, and accused the American Congress of doing so.
The Ekaterinburg Metro is developing a new way of paying for it.
In October, a bank card would be available in the Ekaterinburg metropolis, as stated by the Director-General of the UAO, "I-Network" Pavel Vedernikov, in an interview with the "Regional Gazette."
Our goal is to introduce the same system of payment for the 2010 World Cup on the subway as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want the fans from other countries, the men of the uniform, to use the metropolytene with their bank cards, without getting the tags and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another "Uber."
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his start-up staff in the area of e-commerce, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, unsincere.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff did not trust the process.
"He was never consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs a 75-person company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, who is engaged in e-commerce in the field of hair care.
She therefore sought third-party assistance.
A new type of start-up is now emerging in the field of staff management, which helps companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, which is designed to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to make rapid interviews, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases to allow informants to pass through top management and to contact direct direction.
"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where's the Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, the co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett said that he had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt over the three years of using "Glint."
In addition to the rapid interviews and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company's heat map and shows in a clear form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are a little aware that they need to control the workplace, or they will be another "Uber" that was involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a post on a blog that described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For starters like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation, an opportunity for a profitable business.
The "Let's talk about payment" Internet portal on financial technologies estimates that the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Convercent" startup from Denver, Colorado, to help companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the face of the fall of Uber's reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
The Uber has recently appeared among the clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual staff views, collect confidential real-time responses and look at heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the department.
"The Court of Public Opinion intercepted power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company is ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may have costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, staff outflows and legal claims, Quinlan has reported.
"Ruby Tuesday," a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 institutions, used "Convercent" for over a year to make sure that staff were aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to go to the company's head office.
In the past, if a staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or a head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported by James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that a company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get close to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management team of the Ruby Tuesday network.
"And we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings against employees."
Queensland stated that companies had taken the ethics, values and involvement of staff more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm had failed because of ethical irregularities as a result of the Enron case.
But only when "social media spread" did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading viral on the network.
"Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that companies pay regularly for their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has been endorsed by venture investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising given the intertwined nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of studies shows that today's staff are expecting more from their jobs than they were before.
In markets with strong competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, they are just a necessary minimum.
Staff want to feel accepted and valued, and that they spend their time with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for the company, feel that they are heard and that the work they do results, they are more trying to make such a company a success," said Nina McQueen, the vice president for global benefits and staff satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors receive income when companies are doing well in their portfolio; companies are doing well when staff are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase staff commitment and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
In the workplace, cultural professionals have argued that it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data are useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from staff, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
And if changes don't come fast enough, or not at all, there may be frustration, and staff will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews," says Russell Rat, the president of the management consulting firm "Kotter International," who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder," Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff interviews, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with the help of Glint.
And, after receiving feedback from staff members dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is getting new knowledge of its employees and hopes that, in the long term, this knowledge will help it to hold staff more effectively in a high-turnover industry.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose your clients, you lose your company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is being opened on the Krasnoarmaic Prospect.
In Barnaul, a major effort was made to address the cause of the failure of the asphalt on the Krasnoarmac Prospect.
It is decided to "open" the place where there were two holes on a recently asphalt carriageway (crossing a street with a youth street).
It will be recalled that the collapse of a small part of the road near the tram tracks was due to the land being spilled in the area of an unexploited unexploited network.
According to the Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, Ivan Garmata, a detailed survey will be conducted to complete the survey and to eliminate the preconditions for a break-up.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that there will be a need to re-establish and neutralize the non-expendable communications.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
The time is approaching 11: 00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is being delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus.
Some of them pulled out their T-shirts, nudging their backs, shiny from the sweat after a busy first day of the sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these minutes are a mid-day break.
Players in summer classes will be sent back to the dormitories after three hours of training to prepare for the final examinations, and will return to Wasserman's football centre the next morning to meet at 6: 30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, the team's coach, Bruce Jim Mora, said, "The next three days, these guys are waiting for a meatball."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association had cancelled training twice a day, which had been designed to reduce the burden on the players, had actually extended their working day, at least until the end of the examination on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the University of California team in Los Angeles were scheduled for 7: 15 p.m., so that they could be placed on an already tight game schedule.
The side effect of the absence of two training sessions per day has been more days with one training, and Brewins is moving the camp to start for almost a week compared to last year and is training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they are scheduled to conduct 18 training sessions before 20 August, before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas University team A & M in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules on the part of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that it had given rise to another point on the tight list of players.
"For three or four days, we give them this huge load, it's a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, that would be really great. "
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; this is not an easy task, because its fields are in direct contact with the adjacent parking area and the nearby Laskin Center, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have passed the safe net behind the gate.
The players from the Bruins are supposed to be at the hotel from this weekend, but Maura agrees that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," Maura told me.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can take off the room, sit there and record a video training.
If you have a video of the training, it's very serious.
But we're gonna have security there, and we're gonna have security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry too much about that.
We have a plan. "
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are released from hospitals
All victims of the St. Petersburg subway attack were released from hospitals in April.
This was reported in the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mitanina.
At the end of July, three people were still in prison, and the "TV Centre" was being transferred.
We will recall that the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolytene was soaked on 3 April this year.
The bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator.
In a criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Azimov, were arrested.
As a matter of fact, on the eve of Rosuznadzor, it was recommended to metro-polyten Peterburg to review the transport safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is strengthening the fact-of-fact-check in the fight against the fae news.
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystification to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, and on Thursday, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystification, send them for verification and possibly show the results of the fact-finding under the reference post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fae news, which many believe has had an impact on the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the May presidential elections, and in Germany, before the September elections, they expressed support for a plan to fine social media unless they quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported a new fact-cking algorithm that had been launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition, in order to see which messages are challenged by independent inspectors, people want a broader context to make reasonable decisions about what they read and what they share," he wrote in his blog Sarah Sue, the Facebook manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news tape to address the issue of fae news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the small castle of Scotland was made in the music video "Squeeze," and in the 1970s and 1980s he served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Bul Valley in Kent County, he was watching a violent story around, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with a spear hair and a tendency to have history documents, to have a novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with inspiration.
"You feel it in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
The "castle in England" covers the period from the mid-century to the Ewardian era and describes the families who lived in Scotland; every story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevich, Brioni May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Tits of a Dead Man and Other Stories," a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the bottom of his soul.
"I could have been just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's a fingerprint of his finger."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, fire was lit for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there, too.
I love the archives. "
For a man with such a passion for old paper, to be supported by the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and to live in a castle for four months ("To be honest, I'm a little in there"), it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle for days, went through the archives and examined many property treasures and old things - for example, the head of the hyenas on the walls or bottles that have been in the mouth for centuries.
He went to the park and the ruins of the old castle, spoke to the foremen, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drank whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of the castle of Scotland is not very well known, because the National Fund was not fully accessible until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rhodes arrived 10 years later, the staff were just starting to deal with the archive, which he described as "that the aristocrats had been in the attic for centuries."
The days, the letters of the British Empire, the maps that show who owned what, "You think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, but this is what two families fought for.
It happens like that, guys! "
In some of the stories of the collection, the castle is a starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in "The Employer," the hero is leaving the newly built castle to join the 1381 Crussian Revolution.
"There is evidence of a riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called" Kent and Sussex Knight Families, "said Rhodes.
"The Caribbean uprising started in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were connected? "
Other stories are strongly linked to the history of the castle, such as "The Priest," which refers to a Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family has been hiding for seven years during the English Reform.
Or "Smuggling," about an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning a coffin (which was discovered after a few years when the coffin was dug up).
Darreli is the beloved family of Rhodes of all the people who lived in Scotland: "Gentlemen seem to have been made a fraud, were always in debt and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darreli men have resolved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I represent them as a company of good-looking guys who can take care of the heirs of big states. "
After his work at the Rhodes Castle, he is looking for other opportunities to learn a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamymyaki, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then it grew up again with a forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he said.
"I felt like," God damn it, I have to go back to real life. "
The 15 largest banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprom Bank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK "Opening," seven other credit organizations are going to leave this social organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be made up of organizations that have withdrawn from the ARB.
But it is not just a solution - all banks that have declared a break-up with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," led by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Committee on the Financial Market, which, by the way, was recognized after the last session and the most effective leader of the Duma Committee and a deputy on the number of draft laws.
The conflict within the ARB was initiated during a discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were considered by the Interregional Bank Council, such as the new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garen Tosunan, President of the ARB, stated that the association believed that the bill was being adopted for the benefit of the major banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, in the opinion of Tosunan, did not always properly withdraw licences from some banks, which was, indeed, the subject of an objection from the representative of the CBI: many of the leaders of the past banks, in particular the External Bank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment is a clear reason for the 15 largest banks, in disagreeing with the policy of the ARB, to start preparing for membership of the association "Russia," noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB is low and that there is no constructive dialogue within the banking community."
The co-workers will be better.
What's the end of this?
We will answer the main question that arises from the slightest banking failure or conflict or near it: the investors are not at risk, but rather the credibility of the banking system will be improved.
The head of Russia is Anatoly Aksakov, known for its sensitivity in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CBM is present at the annual activities of the association, and all the relevant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of "regionals."
It is also clear that there are no special shocks in terms of staff and organization.
There is no doubt that the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation once such powerful and influential actors, with their contributions and lobbyist capabilities, are lost.
However, in this oldest, established in 1991, there is considerable potential for organizations that advocate the interests of the banking community to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that, in the association "Russia" with open arms, they are ready to accept, on all terms, new members, based on the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova ("may too much wish"), who, on 21 July, at a briefing at the press centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "just the following day, representatives of the banks leaving the Army asked me to consider building the capacity of our association" Russia. "
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers on the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, proposals from both sides are being considered, and an agenda for an extraordinary convention of the association is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair is not holding," referred to as a possible new leader of the new association "Russia" by George Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of Vice-Chairman of the Central Bank in September, and has described his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now on vacation in Crimea, plans to suspend leave for one day and to come to Moscow, to an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Russian Association, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the Russian extraordinary convention.
The entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into major cities in Russia will not be restricted
The Deputy Head of Mintrans, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to reports from the media, the entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into major cities in Russia would not be restricted for the time being.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually improve the environmental class.
And that's where the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's the same at the level of slogans, so let's stop it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Can we close the whole town?
"In 20 years' time, I don't know if that might be the case," "Prime" is what the Minister said.
The newspaper "Izvestiya" had previously reported that by 17 August, Vice-Prime Minister Arkadia Dzadković had been mandated to examine the proposals on possible options for State support for electric transport submitted to the Government by the Director-General of PAO KAMAZ, Sergei Kogognin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of VAN vehicles in major cities and at resort resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a grinmap.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for the receipt of the grinmap.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the US issues grincards to nationals of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give benefits to candidates who own English, have the money that allows them to maintain themselves and have the skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, according to the United States media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should be a concern to us.
We did not have time to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, and a new report on technological progress in the production of sex robots was issued.
Yeah.
The sex robots are at the centre of attention right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharki, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the co-founder of FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"People are hacking about it, but firms are sending them to consumers in a lot, and we're about to see them a lot more," said Sharki at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable groups in robots with silicon skin, heat on the sensation, and with almost human lines that are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "make" their robots taste, choosing everything from the colour of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and colour of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have an "identity" against which Stepford's wife would be very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to configure in robots the quality they find attractive, such as shy.
There are also sex robots of Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion," which are delivered with an already programmed identity - for example, "Cold Farra" seems shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits you well," the website "True Companion" is a very good one.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She's in a different mood for a day, like a real man!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be "in the mood"!
In the emergence of sex robots, there is a great deal of concern - not least because they are a substitute for real human relationships - but most concerned about the subordinate image of a woman, a rape association that causes the possession of the Cold (read: the resisting) Farah.
On the "True Companion" website, Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" is said on the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, moving away from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjection as an opportunistic addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery may be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It is not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came about at a time when women's rights around the world were at risk, when the White House had a President who was praised for being a woman.
The worst thing about "The Service's Story" is not graphic images, broken bodies and distinguished eyes, that is, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so big.
The goal of the sex robots industry is to achieve a physical advantage for real women (only with a proportion of pornographic stars) as technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like human beings to be able to copy human body movements.
But it's the robots that don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They have neither their lives nor their biography - nothing that would indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, women servants.
The young woman of Los Angeles Eugene (Poh), Jeter, who has been in charge of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will begin on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, Andrei Lebedev, the general manager of the blue-yellow, reported this.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasketball without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I will recall that with the direct participation of Jeter, the team of Ukraine took the sixth highest place on Eurobasketball 2013 and first entered the World Basketball Championship, where "yellow blue" was unable to overcome the group phase, and the United States producer averaged 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 shows.
Jeter has stopped acting for the Ukrainian team since he left the post of Chief Coach of our American team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
The men & apos; s European Basket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will hold a group tournament on the Earth of the promised.
The Yevgenia Murzin of Group B will have five friends: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3), Lithuania (5) and Israel (6).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team conducted two control fights, in which the Dutch and the Belarusian were given up.
Trump's great move?
To make Mita Romney seem very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the fact that the political disputes that polarized the United States electorate had broken up some families on a micro-level was common.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the United States newspapers were petrified with columns on how to deal with the terrible families voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense we're gonna break.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-hand views of a poet from Chicago who was long-standing with the Republicans in his family, came to see me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
At Trump's in the White House, all she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she's been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely on the same side.
It's certainly good at dinner; but I can't help but think that in a broader context, it could be quite dangerous.
Trump put forces into the left flank, but the deformation effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will be stopped being struck by his outbursts.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly be a model of common sense.
I caught myself very much missing the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax report looked like), compared to Trump and both seem very small.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don't need coffee.
The horses are tomb and huge, the glass-fibre pictures on the central drum - the grinding clowns and animals that, when they are out of their way, look at their backs in horror - are extremely evil, and the music that is connected is, strangely, very exciting.
So many known things in this city are disillusioned: species from the skyscrapers are out of date, the building's silhouettes are too high to make a fuss, and the reality of the city is falling short of the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day I found out that the Suisse-cottage area is not really a Swiss shale.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a 11-year-old child and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel an assessment, I would have put a five, but, luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the station this week, I was asked to assess my "experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I had a terminal card.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's still the same plus an option for a 15% tip, that's the order at the counter.
As a result, not only is the idea-neutral interaction slowing down, but it also has to be personal in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor salesman at the department store smiled, while I was tired of assessing my experience in giving her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Praceus was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pronaus is leaving prison because of a visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on his wrists, which the prison administration claimed he had received as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pronius was convicted of murder after an appeal from the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office against an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting at her several times through the door of the toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pronaus said he took his friend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office had indicated its intention to submit another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which she said was too lenient.
The Office of the Attorney-General stated that he would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
The term of the Pretoria may increase by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office is successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A suspect in the beating of a journalist, NTV, has been elected as a sign of non-departure.
Capital law enforcement officials have taken a preventive measure by means of a non-departure signature for a man who attacked a journalist at NTV, Nikita Razzazhaev, during a live air from Gorkia Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
"In the context of an investigation into a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code (" Pobi ") against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a television correspondent in the Central Park of Culture and Rest of the name of Gorkia, a suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a signature of non-departure and proper conduct," Volk clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for police disobedience had been drawn up against a suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, a sober man approached the correspondent on a live flight to VJV Day and hit his face.
As it later turned out, the hooligan had nothing to do with the VAW.
According to the Rizizzhaev themselves, the dispatchers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Moskvić.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia and put tents in an unsuitable place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BBC-V that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities had tightened control over free camping and had already imposed serious fines on all those caught in a parking area not intended for that purpose.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court could impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the US Vice President of the rhetoric of the cold war.
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly falling into the primitive ideological stramps of the cold war, which are completely separated from reality," as stated in the statement by the Russian foreign political authority.
So in the Mida, they responded to Pens' words about the "Russian threat" and the violent border-crossing attempts they had made in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated that the choice "either with the West or with Russia" was destructive and that it was not clear that all South-East Europe had entered NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that violated international law by using force to detract Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotspot of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to end Russia's dismemberment and foreign policy, which is always based on respect for partners and on a willingness to work together in a constructive manner and on mutual consideration of interests," is stated in the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldsher was injured in an ambulance accident in Podoskovya.
The accident took place in a subsonic Stuno, and the impact of the crash on the "Emergency Relief" was on the medical staff.
Today, about 8: 10 p.m., a Mitsubishi car was hit with an ambulance in the city of Stunno in Moscow.
"As a result of the crash, the ambulance turned over," said the TASS at the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service in Moscow Region.
There are law enforcement officers on the scene, and the circumstances are being clarified.
In Odessa province, a woman threw her newborn son in the building, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident reported that he had found a package of a baby in an unbuilt private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors took the child to a medical facility at the scene of the incident," they reported to the Odez Chief of the National Police.
The medical staff found that the boy was born a few hours before he was found, as evidenced by the presence of a cord.
In the course of the first operational investigations, a 36-year-old local resident has been identified as having given birth.
It is also established that a woman has three more young children.
As noted in the main, the family had not previously been seen by law enforcement officials and had not been specifically registered.
The police are currently setting out the circumstances and reasons that have forced a woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman threw her unborn child into the garbage pipeline.
Grigory Lepps: "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada, Gregory Lepps, will be celebrating his 55-year anniversary on the next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer had a conversation with the viewer of the "News."
I remember when your "half-year" was marked.
A special balloon at the Louznikov, Gloria Gainor sang for the birthday party, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending that you wanted to spend your next five-year-old.
Is that what you're up to?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I've been working a lot, I've been on tour three times all over the country, and I've given 120 or 130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not to be fooled.
The way I sang in my 30, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them, you're recording a new album, first in three years.
Yeah, he's on his way.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're gonna send him to L.A. for a check-in.
It's called "What are you so serious?" on a one-name song written with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get a video on it.
And the album will be presented in November for a series of my anniversary concerts at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
A great American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand in your new record.
You seem to have wanted him on your tour team, too?
In my view, Coleman is today one of the world's most outstanding drummers.
He was coming to my studio, recording his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "The news") did.
But for a long period of work in Russia, they have put out, to say the least, excessive conditions.
The fees were from 35,000 to 45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find some good musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found Max Little's great drummer.
It's better to feed one's own.
Sometimes I want to fight one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
He's being written by Western music magazines, invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performing technique, has come."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't go to America.
I've told you I've been there a lot.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our popular music artists have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They were looking for the best possible sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has denied me entry for 10 years.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year so I can be allowed to go back and work there.
The rest of Europe is sympathetic to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not a scheduled one, but a good one, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sports Hall in Monte Carlo, and I was there once.
Now they've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert have been sold out.
At the Lima Waikula Randev, which will begin on July 20 in Yurmal, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I did.
Lima is a great singer and a great woman who can serve herself and a beautiful vocal, and even a whisper.
After the tour and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn once to Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of the High School in about the same way he did.
Just a voice and a guitar.
There's no other form of asphyxiation.
I'll have our famous musician Timur Wedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Jacovlevic Rosenbaum on the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Gbechkova's songs have been gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you write down his list of things later?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I had to go through him a few times and ask him, can I sing one or other of his songs?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to make them happen."
Please try, sing.
It must be interesting to write a album like that.
So far, I don't have that kind of task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do that.
If you don't focus entirely on the business of your production centre.
I guess, while you haven't realized his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of actors I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, well-made people.
You understand Sergei Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center, now there's Alexander Panayotov, who I led in "The Voice."
We made a deal with him and we're working on it.
In our pop music, these singers are rare.
It would be a real pity if he did not reach the heights he was worthy of.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, take off the clips.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists at my center: I buy them songs, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks get rotated on TV and radio.
If they are not high, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out, they get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return the money they put in them.
Although I would be pleased if one of them would make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna shut down anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, get through, prove how I once proved it.
If you're asked to make a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guarantee entry, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
These are mainly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I'm a man of my country, a Russian man, by his own belief, flying to Syria on the very plane that then crashed.
If they say you have to go to some other point in the interest of the state tomorrow, I will.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have this situation with Ukraine.
For I think we are one people and should be together.
I'm sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 or 50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And he worked with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Laurent, Light Loboda, Artem Loic...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and it is a matter of great regret that they cannot now fully take their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music must bring people together and entertain people.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and to make a joint concert with him.
But I don't think it's likely at this point...
Andrea Ottlokova was moved from the cosmodrome.
As "I" has become known, the technical director of the East Andrei Ottokov cosmodrome has begun work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HNCPC) of the name of Hrunichev.
He had previously been de facto involved in the construction of the Eastern Space Dome but, owing to differences with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (ECDIS), had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Files, where it would coordinate production.
Mr. Ottokov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the function is dispersed across the CEENC units.
The technical director of the Eastern Director and the Deputy Director of Technology of the CEEC, Andrei Ottokov, had moved to work at the Hrunichev NCPPC, "I" was told by the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as by a government officer.
"He's been working for a new post for weeks," they said, "I am" in the industry.
It was not possible to receive an operational comment from the Inland Transport Committee on Thursday, and Mr. Cotton himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "I" has been officially confirmed in the NCPSC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, said at the company.
Mr. Oklokov moved to work at the CEENC in 2013, with his service in the space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Oklokov became a criminal case figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, since his submission, regional traders have been given a public order for refusing to do so, but have not fulfilled their obligations to clean up the parts of the launch vehicles in the Archangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in the CEEC have been extended to various projects, but the main ones being the construction of a space frame in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with "I," made it clear that the situation in the East "was critical in October 2013."
The fact is that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz 2.1 vehicle was planned for the same time and the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, it was decided that the construction would be completed six months earlier and that the deadline would be changed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it had to be a trick: CEITC experts had begun to install technology equipment at unbuilt facilities in parallel.
Andrei Ottokov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks and the transfer that had taken place (instead of December 2015, the Union left only on April 28, 2016), the idea had been justified, and the source "I" said on the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out any launch from the East, but we would have been building."
Vice-Prime Dmitry Rogozin, who is responsible for the creation of the cosmodrome, has been a joke for calling Andrei Ottlokova his "space-based Suzeninian," but he has been the one who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Ottlokov was reminded of the fact that, for example, in an interview with "me," he suggested that the Federal Special Building Agency (Special Building) should be removed from the status of the sole East Executive and that we should work directly with the subcontractors: "Why should we all put all the eggs in the same basket of Special System?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CEITC has assumed the responsibility of a general contractor to complete construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex in the fourth quarter.
According to "I," Mr. Ottokov's transition to a new place of work has been caused by a disagreement with the CEEC authorities on how to complete the construction of space-based facilities and complexes, as well as on how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that it would be better for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
A government officer, in turn, calls the decision a strange one: "He was one of the best professionals, it will be difficult to find him an equivalent replacement."
According to "I," this will not be required: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished and its functions will be divided into the units of the ECDIS.
There will be a programme of two specializations in music schools.
In the future, children's music schools will be able to take two classes at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Scorotoslav Glibenko, it is possible to re-read the repeated subjects for this purpose, and the issue of the payment of the remaining second-degree courses is addressed through special grants by RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken up this issue and we will, together with the expert community, develop a mechanism that will allow two specializations to be developed, but at the same time will not be in conflict with existing education legislation," said Glibenko.
On the last Friday, during a "non-child conversation" by Vladimir Putin with the children of the "Sirius" children's centre, a student, Maria Andreeva, reported that she had to pay for the second-degree secondary-level subjects at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said she was in the violin and piano class and had awards in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was detained on the wall of the skyscraper.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man, Cyril N., was detained and on the wall he was on the roof of a high building, reporting the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, moved through a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and entered one of his towers on his own.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
They've got a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security put him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It found out whether the young man was legally present in the country.
In the meantime, video with a young man on the rise has become popular on the Network.
The users called the young man "Spider-Man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate the TBC.
Red meat and chocolate are used to be a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms for those suffering from inflammatory intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colic and abdomen, chronic or bloody ponosis, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
In order to mitigate symptoms, patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein is triptophane, which contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the intestinal tolerance.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colona, explained that the immune cells in the intestine are making sure that the harmful microbes that come with food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of launching the inflammatory process are balanced with cells that increase tolerance, protect the body, without causing damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterial in their intestines are becoming more tolerant cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptofan, one of the building elements of the protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonne said, "We have established a link between one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of a normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophane was contained in the food of mice, the more these immune cells they had. "
He suggested that the same would be done for people: a combination of L. reuteri and rich triptophane diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
Postdock, Dr. Louise Servantes-Barraganvas, after studying a variety of increasing the tolerance of immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line but was held separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be due to the microbiomes of the intestine of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestines of mice was sequenated, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but not in mice without them.
Mouse grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbioma and did not develop this type of immune cell were given L. reuteri, and the immune cells were introduced.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then moved small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells from mice.
Immutable cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of the processing of triptophane known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophane in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophane was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same high-tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their ventricular-intestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of a triptofan of L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in people as well as in mice, but for those with inflammatory intestines, there have been defects in the genes associated with the triptophane.
She says, "We may need to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells depend on the inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestine.
High levels of triptophane, with L. reuteri, may potentially lead to an increase in their population. "
According to José Maurignu, Manchester United hired "genius" in the face of Nemanya Matić
Manchester United has hired "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matić, who is of the opinion that José Maurigna was debuted in a game against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who was purchased for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last United pre-season match before the UEFA Superdoll against Real Madrid on Thursday, and gave the impression of being a half-defender, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira went forward when they wanted to.
However, since Matić did not participate in the "Chelsea" pre-season tour for Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he had only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourin, required further development before the beginning of the Prime League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks football," said Maurieu.
"We'll help him prepare sooner than later."
Like Matić, his new players, Victor Lindelef and Romela Lukaka, started playing at the Aviva Stadium when Maurignu began to form its core by the beginning of the next season.
The Independant reported this week that Maurieu wanted to hire three more players, but pointed out that the club had already achieved a fantastic result by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a great job for me."
The former leaders of the social Democrats of Lithuania are encouraging them to remain in the ruling coalition.
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-Premier of Algirdas Butkavichus and Gedinas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats of Cheslovas Yurschenas, called on the same parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliamentary Gazette, there was a debate in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition because of tensions with partners, the Union of Peasants and Green.
Three senior experienced comrades have sent an open letter to one-party members, which states, inter alia: "It is clear that the party's comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the" peasants "coalition has created for us, if not very easy, but still conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals that we have initiated in the Government's programme and for maintaining the political dominance of the left-wing centre over the right-wing parties."
In the view of the former party leaders, the debate has so far "been dominated by an emotional expression of opinion without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party can lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by unthought-out actions.
The person with disabilities, Anton Mamayev, was fined.
The Mosgorcourt reduced the sentence of a disabled wheelchair to a fine of 200,000 roubles from four and a half years & apos; imprisonment.
The convicted person was previously released from the SIZO by a decision of the Timiryazevsky Court.
In doing so, the Mosgorcourt confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized the robbery and abduction of a motor vehicle from a former Special Forces fighter.
The Mosgorcourt, by its decision, reduced the penalty of Antono Mamayev to 200,000 rub.
"Mamaev is the instigator of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and therefore must be brought to justice," explained "I" by the press secretary of Mosgorcourt, Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account Mamaev & apos; s state of health, the factual circumstances of the case and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, which provides that a sentence may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would give rise to a change in the gravity of the act and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was not pleased with the Mosgorcourt decision.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, and it would continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out an appeal against the sentence before the Court of Cassation of the Mosgorcourt and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the tools up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
We will recall that 28-year-old Moskvich Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atropia, became a criminal figure last autumn.
The person with disabilities claims that he bought a motorcycle from a friend for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the owners of a motor vehicle, including a former SWAT fighter, stated that the disabled person and his assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timiryazev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years of the colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years & apos; imprisonment and serving his sentence in a general-regime colony (art. 162, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
The Public Chamber, the Office of the Attorney-General, the Human Rights Commissioner under President Tatiana Moscalkov, joined the case after a disabled person had been placed in SIZO.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timiryazev Court.
The defence in turn appealed the decision of the first instance to the Mosgorcourt.
The FN will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final "Action Forum" of the Russian People's Front (FONF) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, report the "News" to the source at the FNF and confirm the head of the execomme of the Alexei Anisimov movement.
He said that, on the basis of the outcome of the Forum, the "frontoviks" were planning to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment and to propose a strategy to address them.
The LVVO interlocutors note that the report of the Head of State will provide a "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the "News," the final forum of the LFF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of the meeting has not yet been set - it is usually set in accordance with the timetable of the President, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key FONF activities.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirova.
The final outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulaanoude.
On the basis of the proposals made and to be made at these events, we will form a system-based proposal to address environmental problems, the "News" of the LFN interviewer.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Olga Timofeev Movement, who is the head of the Committee of the State Duma on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that the "frontoviks" would report to the Head of State on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Forum for Action" of the FFF are likely to be combined.
In the year, we have grown up a strong team of environmental experts, seen gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontoviks" are also reporting on the work on the priority projects of the FONF, and he told Olga Timofeev's "News."
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the Forum.
He had previously participated in the FFF Media Forum, held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to start environmental mechanisms to work for long years.
To ensure that those issues did not fall out of the agenda, Olga Timofeev added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrei Kolyadin, noted that, in raising environmental issues, the FONF was acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many of the things they had offered as experts in various forums, and those initiatives had the support of the President, Andrei Coladin said "The news."
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could provide further impetus to the regions for development.
In the future, the regions will be able to lobby not only for their environmental problems but also for the development of ecotourism, with the help of the FONF, an expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a landfill in Balashih (already closed) and about the coal dust at the port of Naodoka (a bill had already been drafted to ban open trans-shipment of coal in human settlements, one of the authors Olga Timofeeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for the solution of environmental problems in Russia as a whole is in place, and the question is further enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
The head of the "Environment for All" charity, Leonid Bochin, believes, needs clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State.
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Zyplenkov, in a conversation with the "News," stressed that a responsible society and business approach was needed to successfully address environmental problems, and there was little legislative effort.
As soon as society and business realized that environmental problems were being addressed - a much more strategic step - the situation would change, as noted by Sergei Tziminkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that environmental violations were an economic solution for business.
A British inventor put a microchip into his own house and a hand-shaking car.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to be set up with a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even start a car with a simple hand-shake.
The thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam put a tiny chip between his big and index fingers and now, through his firm BioTech, is offering this service to firms and individuals who want to make their lives easier by technology.
He joined with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the rejuvenation procedure is conducted in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip that's injected into cats and dogs, and the procedure only takes 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces house and car locks with a 300-pound chip for one lock.
The married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his car "BMW Z4," which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House request cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the military records provided to TIME magazine, the decision of the White House last month to bring a helicopter of the Marine Corps to the South Lawn for an event on American industrial production was worth $24,000 to the taxpayers.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One," when the President is on board, was the central element of an event in the White House on 17 July to demonstrate American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White House officials examined technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, which was produced in Connecticut, was installed near a boat from the State of Man, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a vehicle loader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the helicopter management department, the White House Military Authority ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to know that you were aware, because this is an unusual press-covered event," wrote by the HMX-1 Commander in an e-mail to his chief, the first Deputy Air Force Chief of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 a.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return the flight in accordance with the time limits.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit & apos; s security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was required in the end.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was in conflict with the order.
"Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hetch's law, and we were told that no," the commander wrote.
"It seems you have nowhere to go," said the Deputy Chief.
The event "Done in America" was declared an official event by the White House and was not covered by Hetch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of health care that had been developed at the time in the Senate and commended attempts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be new.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's not normal to ask them for a photo opportunity alone.
Trump was already under discussion in February, when a presidential aircraft was in the background during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was full of complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show" Made in America, "which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 is often a training flight around the Washington Agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the United States President's transport to the White House to an exact inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landing at the White House.
According to one official, the flight for the "Done in America" event was counted to the crew for the necessary training flights per month.
The unit also flew 11 additional hours on that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, taxpayers were not paid for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in the organization of a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
However, according to the Department of Defence & apos; s hourly rates for the fiscal year 2017, the Ministry of Defence & apos; s rate of compensation for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit & apos; s records indicate that the air time of the aircraft was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
"It is totally wrong to calculate the value for taxpayers based on an exemplary rate of reimbursement," says Walters.
"These indicative rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual assimilation."
According to a study conducted by the RAND Corporation in 2015, the rates of reimbursement do not include the cost of the personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, was in favour of using a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week the things that were done in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
It is therefore appropriate, of course, to draw attention to this. "
It was not clear whether Trump and the helicopter interacted by examining the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in a driver's seat in a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky, making a joke about his own fleet of products.
"I know very well" Sikorsky, "said the president." I have three. "
Moscow will provide grants for the emergency units of urban hospitals
Every year, "Saving Life" grants will be provided to the emergency and intensive care units of the Metropolitan Health Clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobanin, visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he gave a thank-you letter to an orthopaedic doctor, Victor Prozko, who had been led by a complex operation for the reconstruction of the teenage foot.
Sergey Sotignin also referred to the decision to grant grants annually to emergency care and intensive care units in urban clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the city chief & apos; s capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is now one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable its doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Coleman Rural Hospital.
At present, the health-care units are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the resuscitation and the inpatient, there are day-care units.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 ha.
In February this year, the hospital became a member of a pilot project for the organization of short-term accommodation (UPC).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time taken for the rehabilitation of patients.
They only spend a few hours after an operation in a hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with hospital care at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The medical staff at the clinic carried out 15,800 operations with varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported that there were no buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
At the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), there were no requests for the purchase of a Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
On Friday, 4 August, TASS reported this, citing a representative of the NBA press service.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, to agree on the indirect (through the Paritbank) acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares of Sberbank, was withdrawn.
"No documents have been received from other potential investors for the purchase of shares of the Sberbank in the NBA," noted in the communication.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Victor Prokopenia, withdrew an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Saidu Guzeriev and Grigoria Guselnikov the acquisition of a Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified his decision that the businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify that they were in conformity with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported selling its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Saeed Guceriev, son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Guzeriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
In the course of the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of parent organizations.
The third season Trailer "Narco": The Cali Cartel plays a central role in a popular series of "Netflix" after Pablo Escobar's death.
Although the second season of "Narco" revealed the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer, the series "Netflix" is far from over.
The transmission service has already confirmed that the third and fourth season is being planned, and the third has already been introduced by the first trailer to show the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the most rich drug-trafficking organization, the Kali cartel, drew the attention of the Drug Control Agency.
The organization, led by powerful godfathers, works as a corporation on the Fortune 500 list, only with a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The cartel leader, Hilberto Rodríguez Orehuela (Damian Alzar), Miguel Rodríguez Orehuela (Francisco Denis), is the brain of Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann), who is responsible for relations with Mexico, and Cepe Santakruz-Londono (Pepe Rapasote) is working in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal is returning as Javier Penyi, a character that attracts American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to assist in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Mathias Varela, Michael Stal-David, Matt Vilan, Igel Angel Sylvester, Kerry Bichet and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narco" will be released on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated at the United Nations.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, have declared the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heisom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for vice-president, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included at all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council elections and the presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In the elections this year, for the first time, power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Hayes stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Office of the Attorney-General approved the indictment in the Nikita White case
The Office of the Attorney-General of Russia has approved an indictment in a criminal case against the former Governor of the Kirov region, Nikita White, accused of obtaining a large bribe.
This was reported on Thursday, 3 August, at the agency, and is being transmitted to RIA News.
The material was referred to the Presnen District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, there were increased fines for tourists for misconduct.
The Venice authorities have increased the fines for bathing in the channels from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For a walk around the city in a bathing suit or with a nude cake, they will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros per day will be required from those who have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in a pedestrian area, and will pass on TASS with reference to the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose a fine for the marking of 400 euros on monuments and for the garbage of 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be through a special company, "Enjoy, Respect Venice" (# EnjoypectVenezuela), on social media, as well as through advertisements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in the most tourist areas.

According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paola Mar, the fines would be transmitted to the embassies of the country of origin of the perpetrators, in order to prevent their compatriots from making such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the turflow.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists in the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the place of operation.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new hotels and fast-food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, officials of the State Border Service detained 272 illegal persons at the EU border; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
It was reported to the General Service.
Of these, 314 were detained for illegal crossing of the border, while the rest were detained for violating the rules governing the residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.
The largest number of illegal migrants, 717, were detained at the border with Moldova.
At the EU border, 272 illegal persons were detained, most of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
According to statistics, most of the illegal migrants detained are nationals of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, India and Armenia.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants have not been allowed into Ukraine.
We will recall that the EU has found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buriyatiya
The long-standing efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatiya (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity users are beginning to bear fruit.
The cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent since 1 September.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with Government Decision No. 842 of 17 July 2017 on the amendment of the regulations on the wholesale market for electricity and power and on the combined projected balance of the production and supply of electricity (power) within the framework of the Russian unified energy system for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buriyatiyah.
As a result, the cost of electricity for the Buryat producers is falling by a quarter, which will make life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs much easier.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have broken the threshold of Moscow offices in a futile attempt to equate the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angar, which is derived from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buriatiyah.
And it was only this year that progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles / kWh to 3.93 roubles / kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buriyatiya, as decided by the Federal Government, in the list of wholesale market price areas for which the operation of wholesale and retail markets has been established, there are a number of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt / hour of 1.01 roubles.
But no one is willing to say at least an approximate date of new tariff movements towards the bottom for Buriyatiya.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in the McVitie's Glasgow factory.
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie 's biscuit manufacturer in connection with his long-term production obligation at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent about the future investment at the Tallkroz site.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years he has invested over 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the operation of the facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union will "learn about them first."
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the GMB Scottish office required McVitie's to respond to concerns that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffy, said: "Members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the master of the business needs facility and the investment plan on the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in local society and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; this is an essential pillar of decent work in the area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brackzit, the increase in the subsistence level and the chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, "The head of the Polkroz facility just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will reply immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the staff and representatives of the trade union."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcrosse with GMB staff and representatives, where a number of issues were discussed.
We have talked to staff about how all companies working in the most competitive and volatile economic environment are constantly reviewing their actions - all of our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested over 5 million pounds in our Tallkroz facility, especially in production lines and improvement of performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcros as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work of this facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union will be the first to learn about this. "
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosoil and Gazprom.
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should be involved in the supply of gas to the Eastern Petroleum Company (SHCC), but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosoil.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Secin's request to assist in resolving the conflicts that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosnethu and Gazprom should be determined solely on the basis of market principles.
In the past, the head of Rosoil, Igor Sachin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for GVCs threatened the project's duration.
Sachin noted that dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom is proposing to find gas resources from Rosoil's perimeter, but we don't have such resources, "Sachin added.
It will be recalled that Rosoil has requested that it be allowed to use for the Eastern Petroleum Company "gas from the Kierin field" Gazprom, "located on the Sahalin shelf.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on the issue were ongoing and there were no "sharp angles."
Did PSW "Barcelona" warn of Neimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Pari Saint-Germain will not stop following Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record of the raid that took place three years ago?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window when League 1 was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Nemar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paid professional athlete, as PSW offers him more than 500,000 pounds a week of net wages.
Barcelona is known to be a rage from how the proposal was put forward and how Nemar broke the contract, despite the fact that a source close to the management of the Catalan club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of such an opportunity three years ago by the president of PSW?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in the recruitment of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in the PSW.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand against them, we will make proposals to their players," Al-Helaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences. "
Barcelona appears to have crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in a half-defence from the PCJ, Marco Verratti.
PSW has made it clear that it will not release an Italian player to the team under any conditions, and Barcelona is now likely to feel the consequences of its proposal in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.
Putin has been instructed to deal with the payments made to victims of forest fires.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has asked for material assistance to be provided to the affected residents of the forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
Today, I would like to hear how work is going.
In particular, please provide information on the status of payments and compensation to affected citizens.
I've got some confusion.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about the amount of money allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions in Baikal.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by a plenipotentiary representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menjalo, and the Chief of the Baikal branch of the FGBU "Main Fisheries" by Leonid Mikhailic.
They told me about the lake clean-up.
They then showed the boys in the open container next to the container they were prepared for breeding.
First, Putin let a few of the boys out of the gala.
Then he pulled a special lever on the cover of the container and released the others.
Also during the visit, the leader directed the management of the environmental situation in Baikal and the construction of a road on the island of Olhon.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, one volume is required and an alleged other volume is required.
"I want to figure out what's actually going on there with our funding," the Russian leader stressed.
It will be recalled that during the 2017 forest fires, the towns of Buryatiyah, Irkutsk region, were covered by fire and that homes and economic buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, they offered to send Russians to prison for illegal border crossing.
A draft law has been registered in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, under which a criminal penalty may be imposed on Russians for illegal crossing of the Ukrainian border.
As the television channel RT reports, a document registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian Parliament requires a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens trying to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the period of imprisonment may be increased to five years.
If the perpetrator was detained at the arms border, the time of his detention would increase to eight years.
It had previously been reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians who had tried to enter Russia outside the established entry points.
"Magnet" is out.
Magnet's second food retailer announced the opening of three new Magnet-Opt-based test shops, which are designed to purchase products in small-scale bulk.
However, the possibility of the purchase of goods into discord remains, as stated in the company & apos; s press release.
The new-format stores were made in Krasnodar, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
There are about 1,500 items of food and non-food items.
"The new service will allow companies and entrepreneurs to purchase for financial gain, and residents will be sure of Magnet for a week or a month."
In the small optic segment, Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already working.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special programme called "Lenta o": it invited legal entities and private entrepreneurs to purchase on special hypermarket accounts, to receive invoices to account for costs and to return VAT.
The project is focused on the HoReca segment, small-scale whirlwind and offices.
In Russia, there will be two new territories ahead of social and economic development - Abaz and Novotroitsk.
The relevant decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The borders and economic activities of the Tor in the territory of the city of Abaz in the Republic of Hakasia have been defined.
In a city with 15,000 people, there will be a special legal business regime, as well as a minimum of resident capital investment and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract some 2.5 billion roubles of investment to the city, as well as to create more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities in which the "Abase" will have a special legal business regime, for example, includes crop production, livestock production, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government of the Republic has signed framework agreements for the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's dependence on the Abakan mine city-building plant.
In January 2017, the authorities of the region reported that Hakassia had met all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the establishment of the TDR.
The authorities of the Orenburg region have done the same.
There will also be an area ahead of social and economic development in Novotroitsk.
This will make it possible to diversify the economy of the mono-city, reduce its dependence on the city-making plant of the Ural steel, and create more than 2.3 million jobs and attract more than 8 billion roubles of investment.
The list of economic activities in which a special legal regime for entrepreneurs will be in place in the new TDR includes, inter alia, freshwater fishing, feed production, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk was the first city in the Orenburg region to have been granted the status of Tor.
We will recall that the Territory is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges that are created to attract investment and improve the lives of the population.
The benefits for the residents of the TDR are: a profit tax of not more than 5 per cent for the first five years, and not less than 10 per cent for the next five years, social contributions of 7.6 per cent for the next 10 years, the use of the free-zone regime, the preferential treatment of access to various infrastructure, and the preferential rent rates.
Loza called Manson a "scum" and threatened to "put it in the face."
Yuri Loza expressed his indignation at the speech of American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with the "Comsomolic truth," a Russian singer called Manson "the scoundrel" and "the scoundrel."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Loza thinks that Manson needs to be "put in the face" for his words.
In the name of the United States artist, who was known for his epathic actions, he spoke of the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Previously on Thursday, "The Arguments of the Week" said that Manson's statement had been commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigojin.
