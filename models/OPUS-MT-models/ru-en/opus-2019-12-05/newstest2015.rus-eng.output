India also reportedly looks forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
FANO of Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO), together with RAN, will hold the third expert session "Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations."
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the Agency during the year and is reported in a press release to the "Lenty.Ru."
The third meeting is scheduled to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to establish a final list of indicators to measure the performance of scientific organizations.
A separate event will discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of the scientific groups and the criteria for the conduct of the assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to develop a common approach for all three academies on how to measure the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the normative documents is in the process of being agreed.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the development of the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and time frame for the assessment, "said the Head of the Expert Analysis Office of FANO of Russia, Elena Axiva.
Representatives of more than 100 Russian scientific institutions will take part in the event.
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m., Moscow time, on September 16, 2014, at the city of Moscow, Soljak Street, at 14.
Scientists found a way to detect their own stars.
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied the turbulent mixing and its impact on chemical homogeneity in the stellar clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will be able to find among the stars related, that is, from the same cluster.
The results of their studies were published by the authors in Nature, and can be summarized on the University & apos; s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of birth and the region where the stars are formed.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The modelling results from astrophysicists show that such differences should not be present.
In their study, the supercomputer simulated two interstellar gas flows, which together formed a cloud.
This object has been transformed for several million years under its own gravity into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint-marks to the initial gas flows and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud results in a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astronophysics believe that their research shows that it is possible to find a relative star by chemical composition, as well as to identify possible regions where such facilities can be formed.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old after a high-speed motorcycle.

Lavrov: Russia will not "clamp the door" for new sanctions and will not leave WTO
Russia will not "clap the door" for new sanctions.
This was said today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, speaking to the students and teachers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
With regard to our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasize, because everything has to be specific, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners are going to do this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be related to the clapping of doors, any wrong that is misunderstood, as the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, move away from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners on their adequacy, their contractual capacity and their reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions are very good at what the partners are doing, and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation has continued.
If the whole voice says that "they will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do so to punish Russia," it may not be very adequate. "
As for the WTO, the Russian Federation & apos; s response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the contrary, we want to make greater use of the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome, we believe, the EU & apos; s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia is being accused of dumping and is being used against the Russian economy.
"We are ready to act on the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the rules of the third EU energy package should not be applied retrospectively," said Lavrov.
How do you use the siren properly in the garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers questions:
Since the siren after the flower is losing its main attractiveness, it is desirable that it be planted with other chickens.
It's a great match to a lot of cultures.
It is also possible and necessary to plant plants that are decorative at other times and that are blossoms at the same time as the sirens.
Another plus sirens is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a strain tree of different heights, an improved bush, a broad-based bush, and even a garden bonsai, a village with a cunning stem.
Just choose the form that is more appropriate to the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad province was convicted for selling false money.
According to reports from the national Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Segez regions.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already been able to trace in Volodvsk province, where he was sentenced to two and a half years & apos; imprisonment in the spring of this year.
The man later appeared before the Olonetsk District Court.
And to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, it was taped in Séguézou.
In the course of the investigation, a number of cases of sale of counterfeit money related to the summer of 2013 have been proved guilty.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file with the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with a general-regime prison.
The sentence has not entered into force.
In the past week, we will recall that two more merchants of false money were convicted, who were paid by them at the Petrovorsk stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One is deprived of liberty for five years and the other for four years.
Each has a fine of 500,000 roubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
In Arhangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the first convoy of "Derwish" was celebrated.
The meeting, which took place at the regional centre, was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Derwish delivered military assistance to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arhangelsk, a memory rally was held at a stowaway stone for a future monument to the members of the northern convoys, located on the Sedov coastline in Solombala.
The event brought together representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arhangelsk, children from the Kchild class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago, when a mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a celebration, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned by the sea, "the President of the Council of Veterans of the North Sea Shipping Society, Boris Karpov, noted.
The event was followed by a presentation by a city shower orchestra, and the children of the caudal class gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the sign of the victory.
The meeting ended with the provision of flowers to the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniforms, tin, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, there were also military equipment and weapons on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikain fighter aircraft, in dislocated condition.
The convoy's escort was 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan was not found by the enemy and reached its destination, Arhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravans, 126 were killed by transport and about 50 by military vessels.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that protects the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"Where trade unions, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is co-president of the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
That is why I am proud to introduce the Workers' Empowerment Act with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities when they discriminate against the organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
The amendment of the Law on the Regulation of Labour Relations in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-sponsors are proposing is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks on trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when that country was at the same time defending democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that the paramilitary autocracy of Hideka Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
While recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans had included an article that had been made public: "The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every occupation or occupation.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at this purpose will be found to be illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which prepared the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted as an appropriate basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to establish civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the union should be an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation, but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have in a wonderful way created a market for industry and raised a whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truth, but history remembers them.
History remembers as much as we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the increased protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are restarting the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jeanal, in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who are making abortions would be obliged to receive patients within a 30-mile radius from their practice.
However, the judge & apos; s decision means that doctors can now continue to have legal abortions while continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to obtain power," Judge John de Graveles wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within the month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision on the law.
The right to abortion advocates were pleased to meet this decision, the last of which was a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
"Today's decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, the President and Head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed an action for the suspension of the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not been the plaintiffs in the case and also applied for the power of admission.
Louisiana is a member of 11 states that have adopted such laws and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
The right-to-abortion fighters, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the power of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from the medical point of view.
The opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women & apos; s health, although some also noted their positive impact on the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who has an abortion in Louisiana has the authority to be admitted to the hospital, and the Centre for Reproductive Rights has reported.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing so, the doctor would have stopped doing so for his safety.
In critical of this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish the abortion doctors while their applications for acceptance were pending.
This will result in the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the products for each item in the range of trade networks should be Russian-made, and Oleg Nilov, a member of the State Duma, considers the "just Russia" faction to be a member of the State.
The Parliament has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, and is writing the newspaper "The news."
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia; for the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the rider will be required to provide at least half of his stripes to domestic producers. "
In addition to the amendments to the article on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, the draft law provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which establishes a 10 per cent reduction in the VAT rate for the sale of products produced in the Russian Federation.
The idea of introducing 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the counter.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, as the experts say.
According to counsel for Nalogok, a member of the independent expert centre "Public Duma," Sergei Litwinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, will have a positive impact and will lead to growth.
The benefits will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the rivals, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some more rapidly develop, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, but not immediately, "the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to access local shops because of high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche is free and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary arrangements and sanitary checks, the Russian market will receive food from the countries of Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, the "moment of silence" is now when the former players have left and the new players have not yet arrived.
The first Vice-President of the Russian public organization, "Russian Club of Financial Directors," Mr. Tamara Kasyanova, said that, after almost a month, it was possible to talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials and the increase in the prices of finished products.
It is clear that the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to place the sector in the hands of local producers.
In that case, they would compete with each other, not with goods that were cheaper from subsidies from another State.
In other words, the buyer & apos; s struggle will be between companies operating under the same industry law.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots, not all of them.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "pull" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there is a growing fear that poor goods will be brought to the counter.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of products produced in Russia, "added by the expert.
The negative impact of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more likely to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this arrangement, as demand for their products will decline.
Lithuania does not exclude that the law on quotas on domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be less than the quality of imported analogues, while shops will be able to inflate the prices of the second as a deficit.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was again mentioned by economists in February this year because of the continued devaluation of the rouble.
With difficult relations with the West, the issue of non-import is now even more pressing.
The purpose of the Act is to require the shareholders, when making orders, to be considered by suppliers with domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the path of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary products will be established within a shorter time frame, "said Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the milk industry, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are actually able to fully cover Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also be given a strong boost.
As is known, the largest share of imports remains in beef, between 30 per cent and 35 per cent.
So 65-70% is still Russian products, "Kasyanova thinks.
The experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products would facilitate import substitution and could accelerate this process.
However, this initiative will not in itself lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, I am sure Litvinenko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be brought from abroad, so that there would be no full import substitution, but significant steps would be taken.
Moreover, there is little quota setting, and domestic production needs to be established in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees, "the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother's memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with "ovarian cancer" in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis.
The leading researcher, Susan Jordan, from the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research, reported that the probability of death during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in the regions and remote areas of the State than for those living in urban areas.
NEXT STUDY: New drugs can slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed women's medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by a surgeon who specializes in gynaecological oncology, and they are mostly in large cities," she said.
While the quality of tele-health services had improved to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical location, the study had found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elisha Niv, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kuzener district.
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibelak began in April this year and was under way on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Office of Public Relations and Information, Head Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was provided from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility built is almost 230 square metres.
It will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight localities: the villages of Toktaibelak and the villages of Dementijevo, Pünchemal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraybelak, Shinur and Chaskayal.
The new midwifery centre will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and its premises are not in accordance with sanitary requirements.
A new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in a sober state of new-boxark will be brought to justice.
A resident of the Duchess will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksarah, an investigation into a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk accused of causing death by negligence has been completed.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with a four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birthday of his kuma child in Cheboksar.
After a long streak, the new-boxark decided to stay in the guests and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a sober woman put him next to her bed to feed him, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son, and as a result he died of suffocation.
A criminal case, reported to the press service of the Supreme Court of Justice for Ducchia, was brought before the court.
Inflation is out of time.
Do the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions between the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not be included in the projections of the authorities, and VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
The experts were of the view that the delayed effects of the sanctions would lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, and the RBC wrote Daily.
According to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation will be between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent in 2014, and 6.5 per cent in the next year.
However, according to Kommersantsu, this week the IEA is expected to make "small but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast before 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could reduce the inflation estimate for 2015, which would eliminate the expected decline in income growth.
The forecast was that the Russian Federation & apos; s food sanctions were in force for a year, until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation is one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change, "said the source of the newspaper in Minphin.
The VTB Capital economists do not share the Government's expectations of inflation and forecast a price increase of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will be the possible introduction of a sales tax (NPA) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, and experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9 per cent will take place in February, after which annual price growth will be reduced, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat summarized the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed "careful sanctions."
The AIFR interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department of the FC AForex:
Price increases are already being observed in the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to be expensive, the Government had to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustifiably rising prices in the short term.
Suppliers and rivals already report on a daily basis to regulatory authorities to ensure that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflows, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversions due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure were kept under control, the cost of the basket of a minimum set of products would not have jumped 12% per quarter alone.
The ban on food imports has caused a shock of domestic supply and has led to a logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully implement the import substitution mechanism at this stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the response will continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth.
In addition to the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Oswayev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation was sometimes between 20 and 30 per cent per month, and in zero it was also above the current level, another case, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's end of inflation is 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of the Maguta Foundation of the CC
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being successfully held up, but if further pressure, particularly on the financial sector, can lead to some difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually found in the purchase of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CR of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the rouble, both in market methods and in government regulation.
But price increases are traditionally beginning after summer stagnation and may become more tangible this fall.
The target for consumer inflation in Russia is likely to be 7.5 per cent, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds in the year when today's young consumers reach the "basic age of horticulture," according to the HTA study reported by Financial Times.
According to this report, people who take off their homes spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that the owners of their own homes spend on horticulture.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the asphalt of the courtyard in front of the parking house and the reduction in the size of the garden as other threats to an industry with an estimated annual sales of about 5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest level of spending on horticultural goods per household in the United Kingdom.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that rental of housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticulture adviser in RHS, said, "The production of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retailers for horticulture, as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also suggests that the market will improve this year because of a better weather after the adverse conditions of March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a mass clean-up at the "Earthdol" Foundation.
Three of the four heads of the Land Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Land Foundation were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture has officially reported only the removal of the Executive Director of Atanas Dkabwa.
His place was taken by Lausanne Vassilev.
It turns out that on Friday, two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were replaced in a quiet manner.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatian Angelov, who had been responsible for State assistance and the SAPARD programme until then, had been released and reported to BNES with reference to the newspaper "Labour."
I didn't attend the board of fund managers because by law, we're not members of the management, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the Foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I know more on Monday, "said the Angelov publication.
It will be taken by Ivanka Baghdad, who has so far been the head of the Investment Credit at the central fund at Zegadel in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Zegaldeye Foundation in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014, will be appointed to his place.
Only the Deputy Fund Chief, Atijé Aliyev-Veli, retained his post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey calls an American diplomat in connection with a report of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the highest American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the United States case attorney and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine "Der Spiegel" and the Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by former United States National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for United States and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Rejep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has reduced the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
The information previously reported that the German General Intelligence Agency had also made Ankara an object of exploration had given rise to a more bitter response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies have merged against Alibaba.
Chinese companies, including the largest commercial real estate developer in China, the Dalian Wanda Group, and the Tendent Holdings (social media, Messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete on the online market with Alibaba.
However, it will be difficult to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com - behind.
Union of the largest
Companies are planning to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in a joint venture, 70 per cent of which will be owned by Wanda, and 15 per cent of each of the Internet companies are reported by the Wanda Group.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
The JS will combine Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and the Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 feshenebels, Wanda runs at least 49 commercial real estate sites throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film and entertainment park in Qindao (a city in the east of China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors per year and to make a profit of $960 million per year.
In addition, Wanda has an American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the world's largest theatre operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own trading centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor of Alibaba.
According to Don Ce, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, as noted by Don Tze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet to come to regular offline shops or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the Grupon or Vigoda.run-like coupon services.
"O2O" is the largest "pie" in online commerce, "said by Wanda Van Jianlin (a quote on Bloomberg).
"There is no real O2O site in China now, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal," he considers.
China & apos; s Internet market is the world & apos; s largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will be more than tripled by 2015, compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, giving Bloomberg official statistics: this is more than any country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that this number could increase to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was, until recently, China's richest man, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has already overdone it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share of Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu, Robin Lee, now ranks third among China's richest people, while Van Jianlin of Wanda is the fourth line of the rating.
"It is very interesting to see this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge the more rich," said Bloomberg, the director of the Chinese e-commerce research centre at Hanzhou Tzao Lay.
But he thinks that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after it was created: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that with Alibaba, it is not just to compete not only with new companies, but also with the well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is shown by the report on the last quarter's financial performance of Alibaba.
Alibaba is often described as a medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
The net profits of Alibaba over the period are almost twice as high as the total number of competitors, which has almost tripled in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential to generate money, largely because of its mobile applications," commented on the report by the analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba website of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company & apos; s services in July was 188 million, a significant increase over the March figure (163 million).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter were made by mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the "Alibaba" debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on September 16.
The Road-show company, which is the first to start on September 3.
It is expected that the release of Alibaba to IPO will be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the record of the United States exchange was owned by the Visa payment system, which, in 2008, had a primary stock position, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products on the trade networks should be Russian-made, as considered by the deputies of the State Duma.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
These include amendments to article 8 of the Federal Code on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, is that at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so that they will be given a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law is also amending the Russian tax code, which establishes a 10 per cent lower VAT rate for all food products of which Russia is a country of origin, and reports to the newspaper "Izvevia."
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced into the lower house of Parliament to amend the FZ on retail markets, which proposes to revive the farm markets in Russia where small producers can sell their products.
The Chief of Police of Magaluf has been charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Public Prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of the Calvia Police on the artisanal island of Malorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the scandalous centre of the unbridled drinking of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Balen, a street where most of the Magaluf bar and night clubs are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Malorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on charges of corruption and will be questioned by a judge with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners said that the protection of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It is no longer about making money, it is about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
We cannot jeopardize our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was on the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video that showed an 18-year-old British rest-man who had a blow-off to 24 men during a bar run.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the hooliganism among the Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcohol runs on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers were fined $55,000 ($73,000) together.
The Magaluf Tourist resort, mostly popular among young British rest workers, has also been the scene of numerous accidents in a state of alcohol intoxication associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing," when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to the Adelaide Airport
VESNA has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights to the Adelaide Airport.
A further 5 mm rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short and raging winds, including a storm that began shortly before 8: 00 p.m. and had been released almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter of the early spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The standard conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in landing of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was to land on schedule immediately after 7: 30 p.m., but was in the wind-moving zone - a sudden change in the speed or direction of the wind at a short distance - and had to be high.
The winds reached 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to be raised during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed around 8: 40 p.m..
The delay in the flight caused a subsequent delay in several other flights, including the Emirates from Dubai and Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two levers.
The estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will be revised to read:
The issues of pricing, the regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connection to networks, are under special control by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
An expert board for building competition has been established within the FÁS.
At its meeting, the head of the control of the SCC, construction and natural resources of the FAS, Vadim Solovev, stated that "the current calculation of the construction site estimates is completely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing untransparent and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, as considered in the FAS.
And they offer the cost of building public property at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, design solutions instead of the estimated rules currently applied and unit costs for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the Minster.
"The replacement of the traditional design documents for design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained the WB Vadim Solov.
It is now estimated that every bolt and wigs are being calculated, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors."
In the Minster, the FAS agrees.
"The first work on the conversion of value to design elements is already available: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of constructive solutions and to estimate these indicators," the "WB" told the head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Minure of Elena Zhukov.
The area of road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the Profi-Investor construction company, Anatoly Demyanco, said by SWGB, the estimated standards are long old, but no other mechanism is yet proposed for business.
"As for the proposed calculation of the design elements, it is difficult to do so in practice because the construction of buildings often uses very different technologies," he considers.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely because of a government order.
In the opinion of the President of the Board of the National Police, "The Expert Community of State-ordered Professionals," Catherine Lezina, the State is now the most solvent employer.
The Director-in-Charge of Engineering, Rosatoma-Vladimir Malahov, Sector Capital Centre, noted that today the market is subdivided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that a transparent market could be created only if access to contracts was as protected as possible from someone's management.
On the expert board, it was suggested that a government order system should be established so that the same perpetrator could not receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion roubles.
The minster believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it would be necessary to give the employer the role of a global contractor, which would result in an increase in the number and budget of the employer.
In doing so, the customer & apos; s staff would have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work carried out by the contracting entities, as well as their safety.
It will often be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the departure of highly qualified participants in public procurement because of the lack of interest in obtaining a government order for part-time work and the small amount of the contract.
The heads of the Procurement Institute & apos; s expert advice centre, Alexander Erastashenkov, believe that the State order procedure has now become a business game for the contractor & apos; s attention.
This example was given: "The participant, when filling out the application, should indicate" specific indicators "without" or equivalent, "" must be, "" from, "" more, "" "less," "" "" or "type," "similar type," "not less," "below," "" "above," "" may, "" may have, "" may be, "" "before," "" "" not earlier, "" "" "not above," "" "" "is" is not allowed, "etc."
Thus, employers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of an application submitted by contracting entities.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Eupishenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the work at the time of application through a "paper" proposal by the participant.
In considering the participant & apos; s application, it is true that only the contractor & apos; s qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been carried out, can be assessed by the expert.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert board also proposed that the margin income should be moved from the top to the lower echelon so that the intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Board, the State Secretary, the Deputy Head of the FAS, Andrei Tsarikovsky, is of the view that this should not be done, since the order is the responsibility of the CEO.
Otherwise, it would be like, in a well-known saying of Arkady Rykin's "Atele," Is there a claim to the buttons? "
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in the bombing shelters, when missiles and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was rebuilt after the fighting.
The beginning of school sessions had brought a sense of joy and anxiety to the missile-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting had remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, the Pashos kindergarten, which had been hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's towns before the students arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to look into the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
It is true that many children in our area need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that all of a sudden it would be "a little weird" to go back to school.
"There was a hard time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz, which is close to the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go outside or leave their homes, leaving safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which worked hard on Palestinian fire.
He said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas & apos; s demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade on Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
It is expected that a new phase of proximity talks will begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel challenges these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were fighters; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,491 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and it is estimated that 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, the officials responsible for education postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is now living in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices have shown the greatest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reporting RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director, RP Data Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne were running a two-tier market.
The RP Data figures show that housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent in Sydney over the past year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next-to-power markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased on average from 5 to 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government spending cuts were made, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring had begun, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items for sale over the next few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low-interest-rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to increase over the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa.
In the former home of gold and mining workers, Edodikim and his son, Ivan Demidov, on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 (the former Grand Casan), 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed much since the construction of the building, except for the lobe.
Foreign people come here as an excursion, and residents suffer more than they are happy with their privilege to live in an old Ufim house whose walls are remembered by the half-water of Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, and historians point to two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
The old court, always the open door, the squeaky staircase.
The doors in the apartments are close to each other, the walls are broken, and the streets are visible from the flicked thing.
I think it's all being honest.
And the local people say, "You don't think it is."
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the 18th century, as Tatiana Lukianov, a resident of apartment 3, says.
The object is in the public domain, but the money is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still bad-for-bad, but the foundations are all rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be happy under such conditions?
The road goes right under the windows, not even the pedestrian area.
Tatiana's moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you've heard before: there's a traffic of cars under the windows.
You see, the glass is all the time, the windows can't open, and the noise is used to it.
Man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still a model, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, the three of us living with our son.
And for other families, conditions are much worse, and on the second floor, the ceiling is just over a foot and a half high.
For Tatiana's counter, he's offering to visit a neighbor from Ludmile Starostin's apartment No. 6.
A nice, welcome woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says,
We have a one-room apartment, a 14.5 m ² per four people, and we live with our husband and daughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been any other place, and Ludmila has been looking at a room: antresol, two sofa with a "g" on one of them, a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and very little different from the usual national interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling it flows regularly: the plumbing system is no good.
Ludmila talks about his apartment normal and amazing at the same time as an Italian who is home on the Roman ruins.
So it's a very old and recent, day-to-day, and legendary one:
The water pipeline was spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a little kitchen in a snack and a bathroom from a former closet.
We live right where we had the Demids and the family, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, so why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Centre, they say privatization is irrelevant.
We're still just getting a one-room apartment, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle, but it didn't go any further than the promises.
I'm not used to complaining and I'm not going to.
There's a whole dynasty in this apartment, my grandmother and my grandfather, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
It's been a while.
For example, big rats were running around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of a flygel, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was on the balls, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is well-built, thank you, Demidov!
I guess that's why no one's been killed by a falling ceiling or a swan.
Only the building is still slowly dying in front of us: the boards and the logs of the houses are rotting, the floors have failed several times, we have been filling cement, but it's no use, the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say, they are, under our room, a secret lounge, and a move to the White River, which was made by the old believers who lived here, on purpose, to hide from the danger, in which case.
They were being followed.
Ludmila Starostina tells us how some historian came to see them, begged him to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced me to give them the living space in exchange for his one on October's cover.
Ludmila refused to the historian:
Where are we going with the four of us?
And there's a little hope here that we can get a better place to live.
If we agreed to a trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the old-fashioned family never won anything.
Ludmila's biggest dream is to be put away, and a 16-year-old daughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most important ruins in which two generations now live.
The beautiful, miniature girl, Olesia Carsakova, from apartment 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There is a large family living in two close rooms, a total area of 23 m ², called apartments.
There are seven of us, two of us.
You can see what the conditions are.
The stucatura falls off with pieces, like the window frame, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms, through holes.
The water in the crane is only cold all year round.
By going through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, it is possible to make sure that the most fortunate of them are the spouses of Lavrentiev from apartment 4.
They're taking over the most spacious rooms in the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
A 75-square position, three people prescribed.
We live in the rooms where Suvorov was legendary during his stay in Ufa, said the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrijevic Lavrentiev.
The ceiling is high, it's wide open.
One bad thing is that everything's all over the stitches, falling apart, falling apart.
The neighbors must have already told me!
Most of the pain we had with the fields: the wooden boards were rotten, the ground was literally out of the way.
I've put up a wrapper, a klinger; there's nothing in the room, and in the other room, we go like a roar, so it's all so shaky.
The house of the buyer, Edodykim Demidov, Alexander Dmitrijevic, can tell better than any guide.
The gold industry is treated as a family, and it is admired.
Indeed, the person was unorthodox: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzian factories built houses, had weapons and bells and held the Ural mines.
The heirs of the home estate are proud of their ancestors, but they don't want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I've settled here as a child in the 1940s, Alexander Dmitrijevic says.
At that time, there were wooden cabaret rooms, stables, and guard booths, which were subsequently destroyed.
In 1968, we wanted to take out our house, but something was in the way of...
The story was repeated in 2014, with a new home being lured again.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran the right authorities, and all of a sudden we found out that the move to the apartment was being carried over to 2015 or 2016.
There's something you don't believe in...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The residences didn't take it.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a paper without a signature or a press: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of residents."
I even had this feeling that our house was long out of town, because first it was under number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57 / 1.
It's like it was destroyed in the '70s.
The Russian planet referred to the head of the information and analysis sector of the Land Administration, Ufa Vladimir Barabasch.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the programme for the settlement of the dwellings.
I can't be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know that there was a plan to demolish all the old houses at that time, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities - to rebuild all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, which are of architectural value - has been successfully implemented.
Residents are about to be settled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the House of Demidov will be rebuilt by Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is represented there among others.
I hope the entire old Casan Street will be re-established by 2016, as the official says.
The houses will be given a proper view of what was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
It's not going to be possible in the house, unfortunately, too much traffic in the city.
The people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash, are promised in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same space as the present ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire started in Primorje because of the storm.
The dry storm has caused a forest fire in the territory of the Hunte district of the Podar district of the Prisea province.
In the field of fire, a group of forces and assets is being built up.
According to the GSBU management, the "Maritime Air Base" conditions on the ground of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Force:
The fire, which was found in a difficult area, was found by an observer pilot on board an AN-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectares.
They're burning wood residue on an old burner.
A strong area and a slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing sites for fire-fighting sites, make it very difficult to carry out.
A MI-8 helicopter is required.
The delivery of forces by an MI-2 and an AN-2 aircraft at the base is very difficult.
Following the discovery of the fire, four parachutist firemen were quickly dropped at the site of the extinguishing.
The main task of the specialists is to deal with the fire and to prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-fighting forces and equipment.
In the area of lunch, three additional fire-fighting aircraft were taken to the area of the village of Hunte by helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the site of the extinguishing, on the site of the administration of the Prisea province.
My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses comedy, "Rudy's Rare Records," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from a series of radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of ruggy and rap, and the melodies are very happy.
But Henry had to go through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, there was a "lot" of treatment, and Henry often thinks about his father's relationship.
It was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such a sloppy guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father's days, he was able to look at what his life must have been.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoke, the depth of the labyrinth in the middle, with fire and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father was in the bathroom and just lying there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to clean up the workshop.
When I got there, I realized he was doing it for years and years to make us a living, and I started to appreciate it more.
However, Henry has come out of his childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious fitness class, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one's eating carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he was recognized as a critic for his Othello, he has been completely immersed in the theatre.
He followed the "comedia of mistakes," and then the "Borders" of August Wilson.
This work is different from the Sitcoms and comedies, which were an indispensable attribute of his full professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him parody on stage, and wrote about him in "New Face."
His career on television began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time, I was the only black parorist / comedian on television."
He went to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "New Persons" in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White Show of Managerial," an easy entertainment program in which people "blackened their face," Henry found that he had been in it for five years.
My family really didn't like it.
I think I want it never to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in big places and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "an easy entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was "a great parody for black people."
By representing the characters who were both mocking and singing the black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Lenny Henry's show" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s it was known as, among other things, Chief Chef Gareth Blacklock of "Chief!"
The commercials, the documentaries, the TV shows and the role in the movies took the next 10 years of his life, but after his BBC show in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit of a time or a little bit of a time."
And then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good at..."
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say I'm being taught this in high school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with panties and cabbage in the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't give it up until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Othello monologue for the documentary, and he got caught.
I have a feeling I can do this.
It's like my head's been kicked out.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, take your text into account, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was hard, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and she didn't.
Soon we started "A Comedy of Mistakes."
Suddenly, I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it.
There was one moment I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry felt instinctively that it was his business to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside me said," You're gonna have to work 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer. "
Instead, the Assistant Director announced that the submission would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something about me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else take care of it.
"You play the play, stay in the role."
Henry's at The Borders at the Dachess Theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the Borders.
Panic's pretty useful, she's strengthening the muscle.
She was well received, too, so it was like a sign from the past, showing you, "That's what you have to do."
He says it, of course, with a big voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mind - all the way through our conversation, it's all over his humor when he starts, it's over.
I just decided not to work in a stand-up, because this thing with an instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do this all the time, it could be a dead end.
I sometimes work for Apollo Live when I want, but mostly, I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps form the beginning, middle and end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up on it.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place for that.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has started biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid shall be informed in a government application.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in State structures after coming to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month is missing from the payment of "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be made to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports a BBC reporter, Vanyama Chebusiri, from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must appear within the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, as reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be excluded from the payment statement.
"This procedure will make a significant contribution to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payment statement at both levels of the Government - thus putting an end to the problem of" invisible workers, "said Anne Wigura, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structure of Power.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the "conspiracy" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the Government," and local information agencies report.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-level officers, according to Harriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption-detection activities last December, which were aimed at testing Government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
The Turkish President, Rejep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister), identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine opened their doors again on Monday (1 September) after the summer break.
This day is traditionally a great event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenia Yazenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the expected journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony was not held in every school on the first September.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a great unified Ukrainian people & apos; s front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yazenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will be given the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing worn shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by a slick of fame from the world of banking, media and internal affairs of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
She began her career at the Bain and Co Global Management Consulting Company, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombdier, ICI and the world of the media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, leaving when Pearson's high-ranking position was held by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her earnings are close to £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
It was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of the BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall, who became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is Tori's former counselor.
Earlier in May, I referred to the work of the President as a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only an enormous and complex organization in the heart of public life, but it has an internal paradox.
The Council has two dimensions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duo that needs complete radical reform.
However, which new President would risk coming by raging and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he himself were to lose his job in the process.
It's a hard decision.
It would be less difficult, and many people would be happy to see the BBC fall in size, after a review of its authority, finance and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge a comfortable old habit, the inevitable negotiation of the cost of a licence is particularly dangerous for the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British are taking a share in the world's most definitely the greatest media enterprise.
The BBC is a good story: it claims that its results cover 96 per cent of households and cost each of them only 40 p per day.
Moreover, it is clear that the popularity of the Beeb is growing: 53% support it today as opposed to 31% 10 years ago.
The models for viewing and using the BBC have changed: I now get the news headlines on the mobile phone and watch the missing programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says that the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
The tweet from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday night, contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats, who is at the centre of prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed and followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the record was deactivated.
A tweet was just published from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it away," reports a later record.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the communications, asking for comments.
Although the records were downloaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was not clear who was actually publishing on the tape.
The earlier tweet contained an intractable cartoon on on the Travis Rosemary Lemberg District Prosecutor, who was found guilty of driving in a state of intoxication in April 2013.
Perry banned the funding of her office when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The signature in the tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication that is three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's department did not investigate the grand jury against Perry.
It was carried out by Michael McCroom, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political trick.
His strong legal team had asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor who was the longest in Texas's history would be vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state's State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is responsible for corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto brought an official complaint from a left-hand public control group.
The tape of the confirmed Perry account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came to the party's fifth party in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to rumours that he could get out of the game, publishing a tweet with a picture of himself running near the lake, and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market is back to normal.
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-east England had "returned" to a normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of a surge in demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions from the peak of 2013," adding that this has provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market was successful during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes increased by about one fifth last year, reaching about 423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" before the general elections next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons last week warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent terms of loan, would also reduce market growth in both real estate transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
The latest data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, with a further cooling of the housing market.
The Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its 2015 projection of the increase in the prices of London real estate to 3 per cent, on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to decline.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital has proved to be very beneficial to Berkeley, raising sales in excess of £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for the right product with a good design and better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the sales have been maintained for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost one third more than the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual pre-tax income increased by 40 per cent from the previous year to about 380 million, and income increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before the company & apos; s annual meeting, Mr. Pijley reported that the estimated Berkeley income for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, income is expected all year before the payment of taxes of £450 million.
The value of Berkeley's shares was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London exchange.
Photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence are published on the Internet by a hacker.
Jennifer Lawrence is on his way to the 85th American Film Academy Annual Award.
Photos of a naked actress, Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who is confident that he has a "catalogue" of photographs of another 100 rising stars.
A representative of "The Hunger Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for "a clumsy invasion of personal space."
There has been a call to law enforcement agencies, and they will be following anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained from the lack of an online Apple iCloud storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims of the break-in includes the names of dozens of women celebrities, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are true, although the star "Scott Pilgrima against all" Winston on Twitter also condemned the break-in.
"Those who look at the photos that we took with our husband a few years ago, when we were alone at home," I hope you're proud of yourself, "wrote Winston on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victory-winner" series denied that she, on Twitter, wrote: "These so-called photos of the naked FALSHIKI, people.
Let me stop it in the foetus.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande had denied that the photos on which she was supposed to be true.
The exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that was a tribute to the critics.
They were dissolved, the best thing to say is, they were gradually falling apart like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she took his hand.
He saw the irritation in himself.
He was a bark, like a yak, yeah.
The last victim of this humour was a little novel he was waiting for more than usual to be rid of a single and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eilinn Solomons was a highly fragile, beautiful, broken-in-the-air from the northern island village, even more remote and severe than Port Royben.
She came south with a satellite over herself, which Kevern thought was her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a raw but similar to a valley paradise called "The Garden Valley."
No one's been in the house for years.
The pipes were flowing, the baths were still sitting on the spiders, and the slugs left their marks on all the windows, convinced that the house belonged to them; and the garden was filled with weeds like giant kale kale.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and cursing, with a full-secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the 2014 Buckerov Long List.
The short list will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilinn were sitting by their hands in a broken, high-grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both split into a cheap console, which provided the country with a calming music and a calming news, when, looking at its shaded brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer who loved to listen to his father, putting down the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their intransigence, this type of song was no longer lost on the console.
They were not prohibited - nothing was actually prohibited - just never lost them again.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word "archaic."
The public taste was what they would never have been able to achieve by orders and regulations, and as among the books, people chose the memoirs of the rich, who had grown up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, they chose the ballad from all the music.
As he was engaged this day, Kevern began to play on an imaginary piano and a rude comic voice to sing Eilinn's big legs.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fates Waller," he said to her, with a machine-mounted two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she goes off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it's gonna cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew he was supposed to, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz didn't play either, even though he was not openly banned.
The improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with the witty.
His unpredictability has been a matter of concern to people.
And jazz was a wit expressed by music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret CD-ROM.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fates Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it agreed with the gratitude of those who had been protected by fate, the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent, by temperature and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The Indian people, as if they were natural and talented in everything that was connected to electronics, had taken care to ensure that no family was left without a working e-phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was done in plumbing; what was left of the Greek was a bit of a plate.
Exits from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, when those who had been subjected to torture, if they were afraid that they would be accused of burning fire, in fear of being consumed by the fire, had opened up restaurants with labn and calanas, and had not been left behind.
Every man in his power.
Since she had heard only the ballads before, Eilinn had been hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern just sang to her could have been put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but a run-up garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could get through the sound isolation of giant leaves that look like cabbage.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She had a bad head, closing down on Kevera.
The world as a whole was nothing but a spear of her blue black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if that's what you say," she said, "staying on her mind."
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say, no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
It didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to make jokes often led him into awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked a calming charm that could reduce the violence covered in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he did, Kevern, too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eilinn Solomons is blushing, and he is up from the whisper, turning the console and the wine they have been drinking.
The wine from the bead, so the intoxication couldn't be an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her, both because of the excessive brute of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, she was like the one here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same misled men, even more sensitive and pretentious after that, who had been able to do so if their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers were to be furious from the pub to the pub, who were willing to raise their hands on any woman who had dared to deny them or to tease them.
A stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, a kiss would be the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote to the good ballad that gave the console, first to kiss her, and then to hit her.
A little more clarification, in Kevern's view, because a kiss was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons was found to be in the corps to leave.
He came up from a whisper like an old man.
She felt a lead burden, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She was watching him go away, and from the top window she was watching him go, her companion was a man who had his own problems.
Adam, who was leaving the garden, thought.
She felt compassion for him and men at all, even though some of them were raising their hands on her.
A man who turned away from her, with a shaded back, a shameless, full ability to fight, left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen it?
One Eileen Solomons again looked at his feet.
Twenty years before or about the above-mentioned events, Esmé Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Ofnau, an informal public opinion control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium-level violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to decline if it did not end, given the resources and forces that had been allocated to its eradication.
"Much has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to alleviate the congenital aggression of people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these shaded branches and narrow terrain where, despite the fences that are wailing over churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some of the qualities are found to be unbridled.
The higher the spy, it seems, is the lower the passion it makes.
The population is crying over sentimental balads, swallowing out the stories of the obstacles that have been overcome, and declaring its deep faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only is the old brute still strong in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and evil infirmity is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even in playgrounds.
"You have a disgraceful habit of writing too much," said her research manager, reading the whole report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put his head down.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbians or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are the servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity that are totally acceptable and commendable in themselves can sometimes distort results, such as those that you have shown me.
Clearly, you are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "rude," others would be interpreted as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to need what is done, if it is to be done, as if it had ever happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the life it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
After his head, the pink, like a flamingo, light letters repeated the advice that the Ofnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, value your husband, listen to the ballad, go to the musical, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
The conversation is better than silence, the word is better than the word written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," answered Esme Nussbaum quietly when I made sure that her scientific leader had finished talking, "and I don't want to say anything but that we were not treated as effectively as we convinced ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that led to the first thing that's been done, if we're going to do it.
Only this time we will throw away our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingers in a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling 'mistakes' actions that our grandparents did or did not do.
You go too far and when you say they threw their "anger" and "mistrust" at "others."
In your place, a man should not need a reminder that, by understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of mess, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with themselves," dare insert Esme, "no part of society can well justify itself.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything, we agree.
And how you don't blame anyone, you don't have to be justified if it's appropriate or if there's something that can be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past is for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther Rabinowitz's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll review your report," he said, let her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who was on the sidewalk, as the passers described, "in an angry rage."
Contacts happen.
The Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied the preparation of a coup to overthrow the Government, stating that they had acted against the police, who had been suspected of attempting to disarm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and had taken over government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attempt on his life.
A representative of the army, Major Ntlele Ntoi, said that there had been no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police had tried to arming.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that are actually planning to disarm some political, young political party fanatics who were ready to make chaos," he told the voice of America.
The representative of the South African Government, Claison Moniela, said that the army & apos; s actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have taken power by force, it is reported that the actions of the Lesotho armed forces have so far had the main signs of a coup," he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing is running the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Taban suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite allegations of the contrary.
The Chelsey's half-defense, Marco van Ginkel, will spend the next season on the Milan lease rights, reporting Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutch will be arriving in Italy in the next few hours for medical examination.
In the past season, he only went on a field in the London Club three times.
We will recall that Milan had previously rented Fernando Torres from Liverpool, the attacker.
Eurozone production at the lowest in 13 months
The growth in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the Eurozone business index (PMI) for the market area fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and enterprises have been affected among the growing tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to cope with the suspension of the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation for inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that the ECB's leader, Mario Draga, may give additional signals later this week, that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, the senior economist of Markit.
The PMI of the German production sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest of 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of real concern, as is Italy & apos; s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum was largely an industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also did not add confidence, "said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to further fuel analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The producers of the eurozone are apparently living very hard at the present time, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially those related to Russia / Ukraine - adds to the uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension is likely to have hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large ones.
He said that "it is increasingly like" that the ECB will, of course, have to do some kind of quantitative mitigation, "although we suspect that it will be limited."
The Maripol people will put a living chain against the militia.
In Mariupol until last week it was all right: no one wanted to organize the Mariupol People & apos; s Republic, and the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now people with terror are waiting for the "militia" to come.
According to the political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to go to the Azov Sea - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupolians have decided that the Ukrainian army, even though it will protect them, but it has a little power against the well-armed representatives of the NAM-LDP, and are going to help the military.
They're cutting trenches, building roadblocks and fortifications.
In the evening of Saturday, several thousand people came to the eastern border of the city, and they entered the living chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same if they do.
The soldiers collect and deliver equipment and products, collect drugs, issue a newspaper.
The city is gradually closing down shops, and banks and ATMs are being discontinued.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: 10 years of school-taking, like the children who are in it, still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen fighters at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who tricked death during the school atrocities.
Just 10 years after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, who were heroically affected by the disaster, warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, took and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be some kind of extreme evil.
The tragedy brought the east and the west together in disgust, which, in an amazing way, then became operational and hope for the future in a world of great grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who tricked death during the school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have stood up to the problem, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now wreaking on Ukraine, where children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back into the shooting gym.
It was captured in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Belyakov, when in one of the laundry, she tried to get back into a shooting gym after a mine exploded.
Aida was desperate for his mother, Laris, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run out of her way, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist, to help people, just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but of course it did not break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who's left.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzer Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I graduate and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, although the memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and from all over the world.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I go through the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, find out about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a line of bullets, believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging their mother Tamaru.
He was seven, and he said, "My mother told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed a child by his hand, and ran across a line of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with injuries on his feet, thinking that her son had died.
When they were reunited, she said, "I was crying out of joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the current non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as the Child Defender of Barnardo's Prime Tony Blair and his wife, Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
I can tell you, I can't remember him.
I remember just after that, I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose what I wanted and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he's afraid for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was a volunteer last week at a women's convent.
I want to help you.
I want to be a police officer one day, and I hope I can be admitted to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, age 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence right after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized that when people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, they can provide support.
She was grateful to "Cherie Blair and her fund for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the brothels, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world has never been better in 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he's not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not obsessed with this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys.
I can't believe I've been so sure for hours that he's dead and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when body parts were all over the place.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember screaming to him," Damir, run, run, "but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
That's how life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilin, 17
The boy whose shocking picture after the capture became the defining one for the Beslan tragedy.
Peace: Beslan George Ilyin, with his mother Fatima, after his capture in 2004, and right-hand George today.
His bloody face was a sign of fear when he was fleeing death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, age 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before he took his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of a nightmare," she remembered.
Not entirely alone, there was a family of our family, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some of these days' scenes in front of me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The picture of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right).
I remember George so wanted to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also think that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called to do?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is going on, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades of time to forget her a little.
She's affected my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares about the capture, but now I'm feeling better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every 1 September.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to be a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military, but my health didn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the hands of a terrorist killer.
It's incredible that George Farniev was at the hands of a terrorist killer during his capture, but he still managed to survive.
During his capture, he was photographed in a sports room sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but couldn't because of the damage he had to his health during his capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to deal with bad things, I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, next year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I'm out of consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev today with an open picture of himself in the hospital after he was taken.
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going all right.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I went there for two years.
He's learning how to treat all the animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what the children should know, and of course it's not that they have to survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George's not gonna work.
For him, she has to be even stronger because he was there, and I'm not.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me, and here in Beslan, the print is on everyone.
He's staying with us.
George's an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terrible is wrong, it happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50% over this nightmare, but you can't completely get over it and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
A lot of friends and neighbors were killed during the takeover, and that only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well, who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have made for me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
I now look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure, a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If you could take all the rebels and throw them away as far as you can.
Alyona Tskayev, 10 years old
A child who was taken to a safe place by a special forces.
Salved: Alyonu Tskayev is taking Russian special forces (left) to a safe place.
She's ten now, and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alyonu was taken from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister, Christine, and Mahar's brother in the school gym.
Mahar, who was three years old at the time, was saved, but Alyonin's mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since then, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little daughter that he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, who is now ten, has no memory of the capture and has bloom into a smart and happy girl, the neighbors say.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alyon and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when it's your tenth anniversary.
You can see why.
Mr. Sinji Kagawa, who had returned from Manchester United to the Dortmund Borussia, noted that he was looking forward to going back to the German club.
According to him, this transfer is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm very happy to be playing for "Borussia" again, which is what the child says in Kagawa.
I feel very good.
A field of positive emotions, and I look forward to going back to the Borussia-shaped field.
In the summer of 2012, Kagawa moved to "MU" from "Borussia" for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to be part of the English club, spending only 38 games in two seasons in the England Championship, taking 6 balls and 8 performance shows.
A man is accused of attacking a girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa.
A 78-year-old man will be brought to trial on charges of having hit a three-year-old girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a transition to Pittenwin in East New.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart had led his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and had hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland will not be in Vladivostok.
The duty-free shop at the Dle Free airport of Vladivostok has put out a sign prohibiting the purchase of a number of world political leaders at the store.
They don't have the perfume, the vodka, and the cognac.
The store's administration has decided that US President Barack Obama, Chancellor of the FWG Angela Merkel, President of France François Holland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other known comrades will not be able to absorb vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from entering an even less accessible institution, the Diet Cemetery, as reported by the site of the general-care facilities.
Whether the American President ever had a dream of eating in a diet cafeteria in Russia is not known, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly seem to be very witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the farmers?
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should develop new technologies in order to produce the varieties of cheese that are needed from buyers.
The board was given during a visit to the Agrocomplex company by Yugptezepm.
The Head of Government also advised the restaurants to redirect themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports was imposed in Russia on 7 August.
The Russian main coach, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to a specialist, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparations for the competition.
Our athletes were on their own level, "All Sports" is what Maslakov said.
The third place is to confirm our rather high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We have to take into account that we were not preparing for this competition.
The season is over, and we have not started to encourage our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but in this season we have a new team.
The French, on the contrary, have set up a combat team that includes 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been announced on many occasions.
But even such a group of competition owners couldn't stand up to the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have appeared in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order lower than on the same "Diamond League."
The season is over.
Of course, the results are no longer so important for athletes, especially in command-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And from the results, I agree, it came to an absurd end when, at 1,500 m, men were so involved in a tactical run-off, which showed a result below the average level of... women's races.
4 guesses on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take a picture or make a video underwater, you have a number of options.
The cheapest option is a watertight "soap" such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera such as GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the cell battery and other parts are closed.
In addition, set up your camera for the kind of photo or video you're gonna take.
Some of the cameras have survey regimes or type of object that optimize the display for a shaded underwater environment.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and the digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off a few personnel, because a lot of them don't work.
The "soap" has a VCD that will help you scramble the photos, while the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have a WCD, it's gonna be hard to see under the water, and the frame design is gonna be a random process.
So do some human resources.
Also, if your camera has a series-based survey that takes off a few personnel with a few different exhibits, use it.
Stay by the surface.
The amount of light is falling significantly, the deeper you dip under the water.
If possible, stay by the surface when you take off in the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to pass more color on the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Get closer to the object.
It's a great board for land-based surveying, but it's even more important under the water because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you're taking an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you have to approach the object if you want to fill the frame.
The Bronze Prizer of the 2012 free-fighting Olympic Games, Bilal Mahov, can move into the Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of the Dagestan team for the free struggle of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude a athlete from the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently in the "classics" team, which is the "R-Sport" of Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, Bilal's young men also played in both styles.
At the youth beginning of the world in 2005, he had won a volunteer tournament and a third prize in the Greek-Roman competition and had decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since there's been a conversation that a new phase of our career is going to be our hard time in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can already play at the Tashkent World Cup - if he wins the play.
But the decisive word is always behind the coach's headquarters led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving the sick from both the suffering of disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who referred to him, his wife was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors were involved in diagnoses and diseases, those who were being treated were mostly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find the strength.
Faced with symptoms like the flu, he found that he was irritating his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusually and ununderstood why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to X-ray his chest.
Only two weeks before, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-rays are back.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affected a plevre, or a body of lungs.
For most cancer, it's hard to find out the exact reason.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have.
But with mesothelioma, it's different.
In almost all cases, the reason is to contact an asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you can ignore.
Asbestos is, after all, material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipelines, construction, carpenters and docks, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it's hardly a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
The United Kingdom is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more people dying from mesothelioma than any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as a result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that, while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually prohibited by law in 1999), it is usually decades to develop mesothelioma.
And the mesothelioma attack is not limited to the industrial veterans.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, trapped in houses where we live, offices where we work, schools where we go to school, and shops where we go to buy.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of income, profession or age.
The bastions of choice, from fashion-based London universities to private schools, did not seem to be a rescue.
The building of Parliament is permeated by asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have become the tanks of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipeline-cam.
In fact, he had to think where he might have made contact with the asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease.
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could have given a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been employed at the Gaye Hospital and who have since developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I was alone alive."
How many of us are going to get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with "mesothelioma" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It's not the usual time to live that long.
Fifty per cent of the mesothelioma patients die eight months after the diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will be sick of the same disease?"
According to a leading expert on mesothelioma in the United Kingdom, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't know they're gonna die like that.

A rapid review of the reports from the courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen was under-seen as being in contact with an asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M & S.
She has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before it happened," she said, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't think of anything that would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have received their name from the word "asbestos forms," which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is more common in buildings today.
It was used in the blood panels, the floor stove, the thermal insulation of the pipes, the boiler stitches, even in the brake wells of the cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as "a serious source of health damage," which could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in the United Kingdom]."
Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the company's main store on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He has conducted a study of the patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelic, when there is no known impact on the work or home, is likely due to the exposure of asbestos from the environment."
Most of that impact, he said, was due to the "normal use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which addressed the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the very centre of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committee premises had been contaminated with asbestos, which could be driven by lethal fibres as harmless as "strong air flows."
Members of Parliament were often accused of having their own interests, but in that case it seemed that the opposite was true.
While the Directorate of Technical Services of Parliament had insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it had now recognized that work should be done at $1 billion for the reconstruction of Parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, following the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre near Westminster, not on the green bench.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules."
It is not possible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with the asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he was working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he said, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where you worked and the dates.
What he remembers is clear is the day in early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of a surgery late in the night.
Suddenly, I'm starting to be disheartened.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't get all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from a plevre, a shell around his lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he could not go to work for a month.
The targeted doctors took X-rays of the chest and put the pleural catheters in order to extract the liquid from the lungs and send it to the test.
And yet his condition was left undiagnosed.
His health had gradually improved and he had returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was in sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his reception room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma."
But even then, Abbott didn't link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with the asbestos.
The connection was clear in that case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed the results of the CT and the X-rays to the team of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott started to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was introduced into a cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just go on, "he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was a week between Christmas and New Year's, "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott was immersed in a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom asked him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation on the pipes is quite common," he says.
The people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in non-typical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-isolated pipes in hospitals were in the basement, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many of the staff who went through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to a toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals have been a place where, in theory, they have saved lives for the patients, but a place that was a threat to life for the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
The bells were putting their Bunsen burners on the asbestos counter.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in the class.
All over the country, in countless chemistry classes, school students were putting their Bunsen burners on asbestos-based sites.
There were websites that drew attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as the ground stove or the roof of the shed generally contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison that is embedded in a great number of our buildings," Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful sleeping the garden shed.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes a long time to realize that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an countless number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information to be accepted.
"It was hard to understand," he said.
"I asked my doctor," How much time do I have? "
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's all. "
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life - the act of breath itself - that causes cancer that kills.
The majority of mesothelioma cases are due to contact with asbestos.
The asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.
When the asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the shoulder, the skin of the lungs.
The hair of asbestos irritates the plevre and can cause the mutation of the cells.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of needled asbestos fibres," Professor Tom Trager, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to the Gaius Hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment centre.
Trager knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably exposed to an internship in the hospital.
When the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Trager, "the breath is pushing them to the periphery where the shell is.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
The normal treatment of other forms of cancer is much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is very controversial.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Trager doesn't agree.
"Unable to cut out a plum," he said.
It's not possible to approach a knife around her.
However, this cancer is "not very good at chemotherapy," which "acts," but does not cure.
"From time to time, there are patients who live for a long time," said Trager.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
The author, Stephen J. Gould, died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he had a mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a single support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Rakokov Central," he was very happy to say when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months to extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "was trying to give everything a little more positive."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracal surgery at the Gaya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham says.
The average patient would have to be sent and approved for funding.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to receive the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial concern: the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos had been harmful to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could be at risk.
That's when we talked about the bad faith of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital finally settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement," according to Morgan, because Lawson was unable to prove clearly that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with an asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After an investigation into his death, the representative of the Gaius Hospital confirmed, however, that "the asbestos in the basement areas in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it has proved to be a major problem for those with mesothelioma who need compensation to have fatal contact with an asbestos to a single company or place of work, usually decades after.
Many of their former employers have replaced the owner or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from the claims know that there is a time on their side that the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
In response, serious new legislation has been issued this year that facilitates the process of recovery of compensation for people with mesothelioma, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
The Act established a $350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case - about £1200.
Some 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with people with mesothelioma, believe that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This transaction, written by the insurers for the insurers," he said, suggesting that the amount was one quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the time period had not intervened and those with mesothelioma would have been able to track the companies and file a claim in a normal manner.
Even Mike Panning, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, had previously admitted that the law was "imperfect."
However, both Panning and Morgan recognize that, with seven people dying every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Panning during the second reading of the Bill of Mesothelioma last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Trager, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunski can be praised by an entire 40 per cent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt strong.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see that from patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott was on his way to the operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans did not show any sign of a disease.
Then I was scanned in March.
There were a few spots of [cancer] in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemo.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, the process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things - finance when I die, for example, or how to show my wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get the bad news, you get unhappy.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted in a very different way.
Tamsin is very communal and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a quick call from a lot of people.
Ally was more discreet.
She didn't say much.
This conversation is something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by the challenge of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the injected fauna are wrapped in asbestos tissue.
The head of asbestos is used to strengthen the bonfire and to increase the heat resistance.
The Pleas are the first to describe asbestos.
Now it's a painting that's not flammable.
I saw the napkin made out of him, and it's in the canteens on the banquet.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used for the production of paper (even notes) and tissues.
Large asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect thermal insulation for steam engines and industrial revolution turbines.
World asbestos production is growing to over 30,000 tons per year.
Predictable statistics identify premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook shows that asbestos particles in her lungs "were no doubt the main cause of death."
This is the first case of this kind.
Mercenaries of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of contact with asbestos, is being actively developed.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal shall confirm the first successful claim for harm to health caused by contact with asbestos in the United Kingdom.
World asbestos production is growing to over 4213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the United Kingdom.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in the United Kingdom.
The compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is maintained at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to stand for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
This is likely to lead to long-promised protests in the business quarter of Hong Kong, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of that statement.
The decision of the National People & apos; s Congress is in fact an opportunity for communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It did not lie to our expectations, but it still furious," said the legislator Emily Lau, the president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And clearly, we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending the decision of China, Lee Fay, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that it would be too "chaotic" to allow the popular election of the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom had transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the people of the region to choose by vote the head of Government, beginning in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave Hong Kong the right to vote directly; however, it also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands through a commission for the nomination of candidates under strict control from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer of some of the most extensive and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years.
After most of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which had threatened to close down the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing did not guarantee a real universal electoral right.
On Sunday night, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could be taken only if all the opportunities for dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We are very sorry to report that, to date, all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the occupation of the central area will certainly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for the Beijing application for a few days, and security measures involving the police and the barricade were strengthened on Sunday at Government headquarters.
The riots are based on the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland has increased competition in the area of goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are beginning to fall under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstrations put the business, a source of Hong Kong's life force, at risk.
"The protest they are talking about, it can cause great economic damage, depending on how many people participate and how long," said the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control to spread.
It's a perception that's bad for investment.
The Chinese public media have also reported in recent days, where Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown by the dissidents sent by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong & apos; s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture goes to university: first-year students are invited to come on a private plane.
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first "Lux" travel service in the UK for current students.
In order to give a clear impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options such as a private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Pantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking about safety.
This service is the perfect alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerous overload car.
Together with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company said that, since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that "students will order the service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that, while students had to pay $9,000 a year, it was still hoping to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and the VIF is exactly what is needed.
However, the National Student Union has criticized this service as being detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NSS for Higher Education, said: "This project seems to be unbelievably separated from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis, where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants will not be able to meet the rapidly increasing costs of basic needs before they can even think about taking thousands of pounds out on something like a simple home.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed young man was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in connection with the murder of an unarmed young man, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zola Perez observed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who had left comments had placed a gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Middle West and received national attention, Perez saw the responses of white women, who focused on race by 100 per cent.
In comparison to the reaction of black women, shortly after the murder of 9 August, the personal essay, with headlines such as "thought of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about women's oppression," was relatively late.
But for Perez, they have shown a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It is very symbolic of the crisis that we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racial, they felt that this should be pointed out.
For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Corita, Mitchell Ferguson has discovered problems that black Americans face every day but are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 lacquers from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?," she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hetteri, Professor of Women & apos; s and Gender Studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hetteri.
I needed a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From the perspective of Hetteri, the gap between white and black women occurred when white sufferers, for example, Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and found that the struggle for electoral rights would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the women's right to vote basket, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," told Hetteri.
The look back on these things gives us a clear idea of why colour women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved voting rights in 1920, it took 10 years for white women to join against lynching to the South Women & apos; s Association for the prevention of lynchings.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
In Mitchell's view, the rise of white feminist responses to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists have had to "catch up" problems that black women have been dealing with in several generations.
"It would be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious about the right to raise a child as they are about the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A famous white activist of the feminist movement, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by the fellow Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans be more involved in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the views on racial issues that are very different in public surveys - will be at the heart of change."
Although the Steinem is fighting for a more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, its comments on race in America are still surprising to some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, by "Who stole feminism?," she said to The People that young men in the United States, especially colour-based young people, were "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but that Steinem's remarks about Ferguson were contrary to the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small programme, "Watch my brother," to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking young people, it was followed by a bitter reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem that advances the front line of traditional feminism.
After the US Border Service arrested some 6,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's south-west border this year, immigration reform has come back to the surface - this time as a women's problem.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are being answered by women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's "pig house" is for sale.
A picture of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was found to be showing a large pig resting in the living room.
A separate house with one bedroom is on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was different from a picture of the living house, which depicted a pig with a head on the couch.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the picture is the home-loving owner of the house.
"However, the photograph was misplaced and was already removed," a representative of the company said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former House of Assembly as "a unique separate house with one bedroom."
Although the agency has removed the picture from its website, it is still available in advertising materials.

According to the athlete, she wants to end the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, and she's sending Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How will you generally appreciate your results at the Big helmet tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I did not have the stability, especially in the end of some of the games.
I'm, of course, upset right now.
I couldn't even make it to the quarter finals.
What are the objectives for the end of the season?
After a terrible defeat, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have work to do, and I'm going to do everything I can to end the year with dignity.

A member of the State Committee for Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolai Valuev, had proposed that, for the implementation of the rules of the GTO, a bonus should be given when entering higher education.
He said that, in general, the rules would be the same as in Soviet times, and that people would pass the rules on procurements, running and other exercises.
It will be recalled that 12 Russian entities will be implementing the rules of the GTO on their territory on 1 September.
I also offered to school students who gave up the GTO to give bonuses when they entered higher education, Valuev noted.
For example, they can add a little points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional output workers of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
There's a new millionaire in Harvey, South Wales, after winning the lottery.
The player in the lottery from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought south-west of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million with a lottery play on Saturday night.
Harvey's newspaper kiosk is a gold prize for the second time in five years, with a last win of $1 million in November 2009.
But the lucky winner still needs to make a statement.
The owner of the shop, Steve Furvard, said that the win had led to an agitation in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought such a win could be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated the win-win last month, noting the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million win from a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and has reported that the win has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A million-dollar from Harvey is bringing the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric vehicles.
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and the Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry of the Interior, Oleg Pluzhnikov, will report on the round table, which held "Statements" at the Moscow Motor Salon 2014.
The plan is commissioned by the Government and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September and early October, says Pluznikov, the proposed measures are related to electric vehicles and hybrids - there is already a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia.
The plan (a copy of which is available from the "Vedos") is scheduled for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
A report to the Government describing the tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a preferential credit and leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, encourage localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulations to facilitate the construction of the charging infrastructure (parking, refuelling stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to make proposals to regional authorities during 2015 to also promote the use of clean transport, in the form of a traffic and parking advantage, for example; and by February 2016, proposals to increase public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include criteria for the assessment of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still being developed, with about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was cut off, so the sales would be about 500 grand, and the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov, is predicting.
But the five-time growth does not make electric vehicles any visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors are imported into Russia.
The beginning of the import is being prepared by Renault - the company is primarily targeted at corporate clients, as is said by the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
The majority of other electrical transport producers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has also been done by Russian producers - "," "GAZ," "but the production of a bizarre.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to the "ASM Holding," the "Auto-VAS" released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the cost of electric vehicles, and the Director of the Auto-Vaza Engineering, Sergei Amans, recognizes that without government support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the cost of cars (those that are sold in Russia, on average twice as much as the cost of internal combustion engines), has limited the development of the charging infrastructure (gas-units) and is being inhaled by the Director-General of Autostat, Sergei Zelikov.
Due to the cost and low rate of reduction of the cost of electric vehicles in the next three to four years, the Russian market will remain a niche segment, and the editor-in-chief of the Abroad, Mikhail Polojansky, is expected to agree with him.
On the contrary, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of normal vehicles.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, and the main thing is to build consumer confidence that "electric mobility" is real; this will be facilitated, inter alia, by the emergence of new charging stations, as highlighted by the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being carried out, for example, by Rosnet: several stations have been built in Moscow and an additional 80 will soon be available.
Negotiations for the construction of a refuelling network are also under way with other regions.
According to the Director of the Rosnet Department, Vladimir Sophia, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build refuels throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging various brand vehicles.
In addition, Rosnet, as a network company, is not entitled to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so for charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of State support for the formation of a market for electric vehicles in Russia to be the elimination of customs duties.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and extending the list of benefits is being explored.
The replacement of a transport tax on environmental (the idea is discussed and for all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov considers.
The transport tax is small in Russia, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where the tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles, which now accounts for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for road owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), the Pankov are certain, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on selected lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single Piper PA-46 aircraft crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people who are in it have been killed and have been handed over to ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident took place several kilometres from the runway of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In Donetsk province, they are dealing with the prisoners of the Donbas battalion.
The carpenters were surrounded by Ilovsky.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of them were killed under fire.
Those who have survived say that if they knew what the situation is in the south-east of Ukraine, they would not have gone to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The Dongbass battalion's carpenters remained alive after the "meatloaf" they fell into under Ilovaya.
In the area of the army of the Donetsk People & apos; s Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to leave the ring along the alleged corridor, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, there were shells and bullets on all sides.
"Based on the information that was given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out," says the deputy battalion commander, who has a call-in "Lermont."
And when we went down between the Polypolia and the Cherno-village, cross-fire began with anti-tank-controlled missiles, with "teeth," 30-millimetre grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three behind me, and then there were only two cars left.
The call officer Lermont says that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died.
Survivors are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food and medicine.
While their own commanders actually tricked them and forced them to die.
They have betrayed us, they say.
Colonu, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
In the Donbas battalion, like many of its comrades, Alexei was a volunteer, as the Ukrainian news described the atrocities that the "separatists" had allegedly made in the south-east.
This is where Alexei saw a very different picture.
His mother in Lugansk was killed - not by anyone but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me there was a mortar attack, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We were not released from Ilovisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, and the report has already been written.
We were taken to Ilowaisk from a fee with Zurahovo.
According to the prisoners, a 300-350 man was caught in a "boiler" under Ilovaya.
Some survivors now recognize that if time could be reversed, they would never have entered the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the security forces of the Democratic People & apos; s Republic of Korea.
Everyone will be tested for war crimes.
A food price control headquarters has been established in the region

The headquarters is composed of members of the provincial Government, representatives of the executive and oversight agencies.
Together, they will be monitoring the prices of agricultural products in the province.
To the economy - Will the Kiev Rosoil recover $140 million of loss?
The head of Rosoil, Igor Sachin, stated that the company estimated the damage from the shooting of the Lisichan NP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.

It will be recalled that, on 18 July, a oil storage container was burned down by the Lishichan NPC and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lictian NHS is the main refinery in Ukraine, and the first phase of the plant was launched in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lishichan NHS is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is able to release the Euro-4 fuel as well as the Euro-5 disfuel.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichan NHS were suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start the repair at the company.
One year later, Rosnea received the Lysichan NHS together with other Ukrainian assets of TNC-BR.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile towards the Japan Sea.
South Korean media reports that this occurred around 10: 30 a.m. local time by the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told at the South Korea Joint Staff Chiefs Committee, the missile allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 kilometres.

He continued to be cheap and ruble, and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
The investors are already in advance of the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, so far it is more like an artificial hysterical, spiked through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not many options for new sanctions to be imposed on the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the rouble continues to be severely weakened against the binary basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be tried with the Idol-Tour.
Orenburg Airlines filed an action against Ideal with a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will be held in October.
The cases will be heard by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first action was filed on 14 August.

The CEO of the airline, Victor Zükin, is talking about 1.6 billion roubles.
The Director-General of the Airfleet, Vitaly Savelev, calls it even more, two billion roubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting to new users.
The Twitter microblogging service has changed the process of user registration to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microbists.
The new Twitter users will now be able to view a large number of recoded accounts at the time of registration to immediately draw up their reading circle.
The recommendations are made on the basis of the interests identified in the registration.
However, Twitter automatically sets a subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take his own notes off to avoid reading those he's not interested in.
While before, only the avatar of the recommended users were seen by the users of the microbial service, Twitter is now producing a sample of one of the popular tweets of the blogger to help give the impression of the person.
This is the largest change in Twitter's Twitter page over the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been working actively to upgrade the service.
This activity is primarily related to the continued efforts of the service to achieve imperfection.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in readers & apos; activity.
The company is in desperate need of more loyal resources for consumers who would have stayed on once for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be a son-in-law and a rainy day.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cold and rainy throughout the day, with meteorologists reporting.
The air temperature in Moscow is between 16 and 18 degrees, and 13 to 18 degrees in Podoskovje.
With a cloud with clear weather, the rain will pass, and the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3-8 metres per second.
The vehicle disposal programme resumed as of 1 September
As of 1 September, a programme for the recycling of cars is being relaunched in Russia.
10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose by 31 December 2014.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would be between 40,000 per car and 350,000 roubles per cargo.
In the past, Russia has already had such a programme for the recycling of cars.
The main difference in the current project was explained by the Minister that it was now not only envisaged that vehicles would be disposed of to obtain a subsequent discount, but also that, if the car had reached the age of six, it would be possible to purchase a new one with a discount when the old one was transferred to the "trade in" from the dealer.
Over 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, which was in effect from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011.
As a result, the level of car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent in 2009).
The creator coming out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism.
The Gaimdesigner Nicky Keyes, known for the game "Coming Out Simulator," decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He told me about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Keyes started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact is only now known.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where the protests that began after a police officer killed an unarmed black young man are under way.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be on how the information coverage of the stories affects their effects.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to take a picture of what is happening in the areas where there is a clash between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he takes off the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police are going to take a better look at him and let him go where an ordinary person can't go.
If he can cover events differently, his photos can turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will have to be recruited using a hero tweeted, where new subscribers will appear, if the photos put there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of the release and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Keyes, however, published an image showing how an event could change depending on how it was taken and processed.
In an interview, Kill Screen Keyes explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but he wanted to focus on events in the Gaza Strip rather than on protests in the United States.
After he started to collect material for the game, the gamdesigner realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to play a game on the basis of what had happened.
Nicky Keyes is an independent developer who issues browser games.
The most famous project was the coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014.
This game, which is about the events of Keyes' own biography, is about how a bisexual young man is trying to tell her homophobic parents about her relationship.
Geletheus is dragging Ukraine into the continuation of the bloodshed.
The call for the preparation of another "tens of thousands" of victims, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Geleti, is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, as described in the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Gelém, who said that" the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists "had been completed and the beginning of the" Great National War, "which would be worth" tens of thousands. "
The adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, a subject for the study of non-military experts, "is mentioned in a report from Russian diplomats.
They have difficulty in believing that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that, if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that the "operation for the release of the eastern part of Ukraine" had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, the horror has reached over 60 Hollywood stars.
The hackers hacked the primitive passwords into the iCloud (data repository) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.

Tony Stewart has an accident coming back on the track.
The return of Tony Stewart to the track ended little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart broke into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre broke into 172 circles, ending his performance.
Stuart drove his car into the garage, and then he left without talking to the reporters.
His team leader, Chad Johnston, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but would now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond, and I hope we can do better.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race on a Sunday night after a clash with Kyle Bush, which required the repair of the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty good hope to come to the end," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on a tow truck, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car was hit and killed by another driver during a traffic race in the north of New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either in Atlanta or on the next race in Richmond to take part in the pursuit.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that killed a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the road to express his displeasure to Stuart during the race.
Law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
It was not decided whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champion was met with loud heads and applause when he was represented before the race.
Started from position 12, Stuart was on the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching position 4.
Then 122-circle after the relaunch of Bush's number.
The car left the track on the way out of turn 2 and hit Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but he was back to position 21.
Sobchak and Vitorgan are having cigarettes with Zvanetsky in Odessa.
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the television manager has not delayed in his Instagram.
Indeed, one photograph was very surprising and very confusing for a couple of fans.
It's taken from Zvanetsky.

Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital.
In the course of a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The increase in wages is also part of the list of requirements to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, officers made a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding that the previous 24-hour shifts be returned.
Although the prison service union has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BDP) reports.
The negotiations are ongoing, and the head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of Sentences, Rosen Jelazkov, reported to the PDP.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior will join in the protest of the prison service trade union.
The army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prayat (right) appointed the Minister of Defence, Rule Wongsuvan (left)
The military ruler and the Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayat Chan-Ocha, have announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers of the country, with more than one third of the positions held by retired generals or generals.
The army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayat Chan-Och was officially approved as Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government to that post.
The 60-year-old military, who took power in the country as a result of a blood-free coup on 22 May, was the only candidate for the premiere post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by a six-year demonstration in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat's Government.
Officially, the Chan-Ocha Prayat will be a temporary premier, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there is concern that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
against the background of the total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army withdrew from the post of Prime Minister, brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taqsin.
Both were popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which had made them successful on several occasions.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elite have joined the anti-Government movement, which has almost paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said it would be better in the midday salad, I didn't promise you that, a waitress from the new Palm bracelet.
It has to be formally recognized that it is true, but the mind and the stomach remain incongruent.
Because we all know for a long time that we say "Belgium" - we mean myths, we say "middlemen" - we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to say in-depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that are not good, but even great, but some unlucky.
So, when I sat at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a Café "Gorodka" (after the same television show), then "Odessa-Mom," and a restaurant called "Bojolé" and a beer "Drujba."
Now it's a beer again, but not a nostalgic Soviet one, but a Belgian one.
Only the tip of the iceberg has been placed over the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, and all the rest of the space is without even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, there's a TV where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg have been out of date for a long time, so there's a comparison.
There are eight types of split beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 roubles).
The company-positive waitress is having fun presenting the menu, saying that "the myths are the raw big seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The change is expected for content, but is often very unexpected for execution.
Well, for example, who is given the idea that a butcher with a walloon chunky (280 rubles) is actually a carpacho, cut in a way that is so thin that pergam paper is not as thick as matter.
You can only feel some taste if you have a half a plate.
The salad is even worse.
Classic lexic (260) would be the most appropriate crime against the Belgian people: some creepy iceberg, a long-time-old potato, sprayed Kenyan beans, white bacon chips, plus some marinated onions.
You won't want to meet anyone with a lilly salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could close your eyes on unmature quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked shampoons, then why do you think the myths look like they've had a few times in their lives to unfreeze and make them.
I already know there are quite normal white-sea mysteries here!
They're served in "your choice sauce" pits (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
The half-dozen sauce, the one from the white wine, the celery, and the carrots, didn't really ask.
There are some vegetables, and there's no scent, and if there was wine, it's still a mystery.
But they're good-looking fritts with home mayonnaise.
A chicken sandwich here is not a bread, thick to the extent that, depending on the mood, you can decide the first or second course in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was said that the rabbit was cooking a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
The situation was diametrically the opposite: the rosemary was all over the place.
It was the impression that this rabbit had been fed exclusively by rosemary mites during his life, and that the meat had acquired such an extraordinary flavor.
But the rabbit's leg was a great one, no, just an abrupt breast in a caramelized crust.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also raw, with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Clanberry sauce turned out to be too much water, and waffles are dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informal in asking for his lunch impressions.
So we should come again.
The dollar was raised on the MMW above 37 roubles on news about the new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar for "tomorrow" by 10: 29 was 26.9 kopek and was 37.02 rubles, and the euro was raised by 30 kopeks, up to 48.73 rubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The binary basket grew by 28 kopek to the level of the previous closure, at a cost of 42.28 roubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum on 19 February 2009, at which time it was 36.43 roubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was 37,005 roubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The reduction of the rouble is long-term, with a couple of euros and a couple of dollars.
The long-term forecast was that mark, said the senior analyst of Alpari, Anna Bodrov.
All that is related to Ukraine will in one way or another be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, the rumours about the military invasion have not been confirmed on any side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to this kind of news was cut off yesterday.
A week is expected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, and the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links of the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to spread, from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of current prices per autumn.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruit will end soon, and there will be a vacuum while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dollar came up to 37 roubles, passed it and came back, there is no strong hysterical," the Chief of Market Analysis, "The opening of Broker," Constantin Bushuev.
It will still be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
He said that the Ruble had been drastically weakened after the end of the tax season, followed by news on Ukraine, and that the ECB had stated last week that by the end of the year it was fully moving to a floating rate and had refused any foreign exchange intervention.
In view of the day's fluctuation, it was no different from the previous one during this month, and it was the 37 roubles that scared everyone, and the analyst continues.
So, nothing powerful has happened in terms of turnover.
The turbulence of the exchange market was, I will recall, when there was an increased demand for the currency at the end of January, as well as a third March when the ECB shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the reduction of the rouble.
First of all, this is an increase in the income from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers by increasing imports, as is said by the Chief Analyst of UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.
A negative development is the cost of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, increase inflationary pressure and, as a result, increase the borrowing of money, which in turn hinders the development of the country & apos; s economy.
With regard to the stock market, the devaluation of the rouble is somewhat offset by the decline in the prices of the shares expressed in the roubles.
For example, the MIMB index fell by 1.67 per cent during the quarter tender and the RTS Index lost 3.27 per cent.
This significant difference in the relative value of the decline in the indices is due to a decrease of more than 1.5 per cent in the rouble during the day.
The relaxation of the rouble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy a currency.
The practice has shown that emotions are being phased out and that the rubble quotations have partially or completely restored the lost positions.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 roubles per dollar," Alexei Kozlov notes.
Genetic failure is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her teenage age thinking she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a Chaco-Marie-Tuta disease, a group of hereditary disorders that caused brain and spine damage.
The CMT UK Charitable Organization reported that a misdiagnosed diagnosis is a frequent problem among people with STS, because so little is known about this state.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are believed to have a PMT that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unsure walking, and undercooked feet.
The sick can feel desecration or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressive, which means that the symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the Friedreich (AF) attack, a state for which the projection was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and died before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said, "I knew by the child that I could not do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to ride a roller or a skateboard with other kids, and I've been bullied at school a lot because of the way I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations, to release the Achilles tendon and straighten up the feet, she looked into the medical records when her doctor left the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't be, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, I found information about that state in the library, and I wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and I felt the worst panic I could.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18, and I'd die before I was 25, and I'd gradually lose all my powers in this period.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you're having this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that is a much less dangerous threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she was found to have an EMT.
"When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The United Kingdom & apos; s HMT Charitable Organization has announced a month of information about the HMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on the entrepreneurs of the Washington Zone is increasing as the economy reproduces.
The recovery economy means more clients, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies throughout the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion in total to the state and local budgets in financial 2013, 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business at the state and local levels increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, the third consecutive year of growth after the successive years of decline in accounts in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by the professional service firm Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the tax policy unit.
More than half of the county & apos; s tax revenues, 56 per cent, are from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland & apos; s tax revenues are from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax revenue, in proportion, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the still value of real estate, as researchers say, which increased real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states such as California, New York and Texas account for a large share of these revenues, the same seems to be the case in the Washington Zone.
In the county, Maryland and Virginia, companies paid $10 billion in real estate taxes by state and local level last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the observed revaluation of real estate has no similar effect on the increase in tax revenues at the state and local levels in Maryland, where real estate taxes rarely exceed one fifth of the company & apos; s tax accounts.
The companies of Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What is going on in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, the executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also appears to be being adjusted according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income tax, most of all in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The level of growth in the District of Colombia was the same as the national average of 4.3 per cent, while that in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, there was the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, compared with a relatively high rate of 9,975 per cent in the district.
A similar study by the United States Chamber of Commerce earlier this year has shown that in Virginia there are lower taxes for state and local-level entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate in terms of business taxes than in Maryland.
The county was not assessed in the study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from his neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, just as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet its tax income targets in the following year, the law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to be feeling better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid as an individual income tax by small business owners - a transition structure that is organized by most small firms - in the District of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than those for the entrepreneur as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenue is likely to continue this year, with a turnover tax from state and local governments, which increased by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind, as the decline in federal spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The Judo World's home championship brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
According to this indicator, the Russians were given only the main favorite of the competition, the Japan team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
The owner was Beslan Mudranov, who was in the category up to 60 kg.
In the same final fight against Boldbaatar Gangbat of Mongolia, however, the outcome of the confrontation resolved only one point received by the Russian Federation.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia, with three medals won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions, up to 66 kg of silver was delivered to Mikhail Pulayeva and bronza to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final victory, the Russian man gave up the 2011 and 2013 World Champion to the Japanese Masashi Ebinum.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost his compatriot at the fourth final stage, was successful in the consolation tournament and became a bronze winner.
In a female tournament of up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzutin also reached the third stage of the play.
In the semifinals, she lost the current World Champion, Milinda Kelmendi, from Kosovo, who, at the championship, played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In a fight for the bronze, Kuzutin won from Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, he still admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
And again, Kelmendi was a barrier to the Russian people's path to gold, winning Kuzutin earlier in the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, bronzu placed Musa Moguskov, who had been fighting in category up to 73 square kilometres, in a copy of the Russian team.
In the quarterfinals, he was offended by a former representative of Moldavia, Victor Skovortsov, who is now in charge of the UAE team.
But then a Russian man won two battles and became a reward-holder.
Muguszkov performed at a home championship with a thigh injury, which he is planning to heal soon, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for ex-Moldovine Skvortsov, he and he made it to the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another compatriot who accepted the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko and bronze, had completed a performance in the category up to 100 kvs.
The fourth day of PM-2014 also brought one bronze to Russia, which Ivan Nifontov won in a category of 81 kg.
In a heavy battle of the small final, he won the French Alan Schmidt by a comment from the rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians were traditionally limited to one bronze at the men's tournament until 90 kvs.
Its owner was Cyril Questions, and Russia's team was guaranteed this medal: his rival for the consolation end was the compatriot of Kirill Denisov.
The fight itself, however, did not take place: the masked's rival was unable to get out on the tattoos because of the injury.
The men's bronze was conquered by the owners, and on the sixth day of the competition, it was copied by Renat Saidov, who was in the category above 100 square kilometres.
In the consolation ending, he won a clear victory over the Brazilian David Mora.
This is the end of the individual part of the world.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, they played World Champions in team games.
Both Russian men and women were among the main candidates for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, they were not lucky to have a beautiful sex, but they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judoists won a team silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they fought hard against account 2-3 and gave the main favorites of the competition, the team of Japan.
At the same time, Russia & apos; s team led 2-0 after the clear victory of Khan-Magomedov and the will of Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in more heavy categories, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
The same scenario also developed a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, with 2-0, gave up to the Japanese, 2-3.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, attended the team competitions in Chelyabinsk and congratulated the men's silver team after the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I'm saying that it was clear that you could be champions," Putin said, the words of which the RIA is "News."
To lose to the Japanese, to the Judo birth authorities, there's nothing wrong with it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's home championship was much better than a year ago at a level like this in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals, one silver and two bronze, in the Russian team's activity.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a man enters the Olympic cycle into the eight most powerful, he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
In particular, in a form of sport such as Judo, "the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation, Vitaly Mutko, summarized the results of the tournament, whose words are given by the press service of the championship.
Japan is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different dignity, five of which were gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
The family of Joan Rivers is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since his arrival at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart arrest at a hospital in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopi, from sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under drugs and under close surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "difficult."
The response was broad, including many Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
They can all be kings.
On sale, the debut album by Royal Blood, a new hope for a British rock that took the rock duets out of the clubs straight to the stadium.
The Royal Blood duet is only a year on stage, but is already active for the BBC music award, the Arctic Monkeys opening tour, and a New York concert visit from Jimmy Paige himself.
Their debut album, "A few months before the release," was given 100,000 orders, and the contract is in the Major label Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is emerging, because it is not a new Lana Del Rey or another sweet voice from the "new R'n 'B" but a duet of British-like duets playing with the level of intensity and intensity that was last in fashion a few decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album were particularly high due to all the above-mentioned circumstances and have already been fully justified.
The duet had not for a reason taken a name that could have been attacked before, except for a very desperate hairy metal, and the blood of which kings are running, they think, in their veins, is also clear.
It is, of course, a matter of the past-level heroes Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood is intended to shake the established blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It may be a little early to make a forecast of the success of this enterprise, but there is something that can be said.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's gift as a strong and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers are, of course, not to be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is a one that is remembered not by the melody line, but by the drum party.
The musicians say it's easier to catch a song than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting a powerful "Little Monster" and a closing record of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy-rock party, but when they are lost in a row, they are merged into a more or less homogenous strip.
And that's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The power of Royal Blood is that they do not claim to be the winners of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather the successor to Motörhead), but have removed many rock duets from the ghetto indy clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is made for stadiums, in a room of less than a few thousand people, it is clearly close.
The secret is part of the hypnotic use of the bass that replaced the guitar in a normal format, designed at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about tools, but also about the very approach to the writing of songs.
The heroes of the zero were hard to move beyond the post-modernist paradigm, and were very reluctant to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as self-sufficient creative units.
The Royal Blood is already sound so powerful, and it is so hard that it is a kind of a dart that has been successfully draining some of the secondary and hardness of the music material.
So, after all, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitter for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON has just confirmed what the Information reported on Friday morning: an online store - and a video producer and a hundred other things - is buying Twitter's $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitter to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitter to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination looked natural.
Twitter, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general flow service, a version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their internal games; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitter.
And "let's play," a genre of video clips where all-know-how are given (mostly old-fashioned) processing, like the "Mystery Theatre," is already popular on YouTube.
The thing is that YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twitter, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitter was met without a particular interest, a classic example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that he was reportedly prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the executive director of Twitter, Emmet Shir: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitter.
Snowons like me, who say they're better at sports than watching it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the joystick into their own hands.
One thing is to look through a friend's shoulder at 3: 00 in the morning, when she crawls through Resident Evil, and the other is to watch some foreign man get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of view on its own can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I will agree that the speed passes in which the Bannister Rogers of our e-age end a whole game in record time are entertaining.
But if it's not about the game's virtues or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitter channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitter has 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon make a living on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitter will be made at the Amazon Instant Video as well as the way YouTube could just absorb Twitter.
However, Twitter has something that any company would be happy to get: the crowds of young men that the advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitter Shir, Amazon and Twitter said, "both believe in the future of the games," and this channel does not show signs of a link, even - oh - as a sight sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
He spoke to the surviving hostages - almost all of them now, the students, the parents of the victims, the cemetery keeper, the City of Angels, Ramon Caspolatov, the head of the "Mother Beslan" committee, Susana Dudieva, who took part in a special operation by a PES officer, told the correspondent of the Society of Elizabeth Antonov, who was working on a special project.
On his return to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who was the President's adviser for the Northern Caucasus 10 years ago and engaged in talks with terrorists, as well as with an "B" officer of the Russian Federal Government, Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What was particularly shocking to me during the work on this topic is that in Beslan, it's like it's been gone for ten years.
This is an extremely painful topic for all who have anything to do with it, and it is difficult for people to agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But you can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job, "Antonov said.
The special project was prepared by the Rambler & Co Infography Studio, which has been working for the company since spring this year.
The previous special projects focused on the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Japanese Sea, reporting Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m., local time, from the province of Chagando, on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly fell into the Japan Sea, flying about 220 kilometres, and declared the South Korean Joint Staff Chiefs Committee.
The deputies suggested that the entry into force of the Personal Data Act should be accelerated.
If the initiative is successful, the Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015.
A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative work of the lower house.
It was sponsored by the deputies of the State Duma, Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDDP), Yevgeny Fedorov ("One Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
This change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to preserve personal data and to respect the confidentiality of communications on information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is being sought by parliamentarians, requires that the personal data of Russians being processed on the Internet be kept in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, stockpile, store, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, in databases located on Russian territory, and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the Act gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information that is processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the establishment of so-called "black lists" of offending sites, an automated information system, "Register of violators of the rights of personal data entities."
The law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugov and Vadim Dengin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of KRPF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also co-sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have a date-centres in the Russian Federation will have to pay for the rent.
Commenting on the draft law introduced to the State Duma today, Leonid Levin, the first head of the Duma Information Policy Committee, stated that he did not see any problems in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that by 1 January 2015 would not have their own Russian personal data repositories in the territory of the Russian Federation would be able to rent them, for example, from Rostelecom, who had repeatedly said that they were ready to provide their servers for rent and already provided their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that were already providing their servers.
"In addition, there are several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem, they will have technological facilities to accommodate," Levin summarized.
Sports Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that, if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include the online reservation services for air tickets and hotels.
In the view of the association, "the draft law deprives the entities of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to control their own data by necessarily determining that their recording, systematization, etc., should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement stressed that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user where the record is being recorded and to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it would be possible for it to decide on the territory in which the action would take place.
However, the adoption of such draft legislation on "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
The test member, with a bucket of ice water, dislocated the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK was so screaming when ice water was poured on her head that damaged her face's bone structure.
This test with a bucket of ice water went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she was so screaming during an ice water bucket test that her jaw was out.
Isabelle Roberts was screaming so hard when she had ice water on her head that damaged her face structure.
"The water was so cold I was screaming, but when I did, my jaw started shooting," she said The Mirror.
Water's on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a second before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn't close, it was stuck, and then it came to me that something was wrong.
Then my mom and sister had the same understanding and they started hunting, but I had to be taken to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to the hospital to put her jaw in after her participation in a popular engagement on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Novorossia Army claims to have been shot down by Ukrainian Su-27 and accused of violating the ceasefire
As at 10: 00 on 1 September, a total of 402 prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were injured, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Novorossia Army.
He added that "a Su-27 aircraft, in violation of the ceasefire, was shot down by air defence forces in the area of the town of Mereski."
According to the agency & apos; s interviewees, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the shelling of the Lugana airport.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia had been able to damage two Ukrainian military helicopters at a field airfield during the night, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The loss of life of the enemy - up to 100 people killed and injured - was taken into custody by 13 persons," a summary of the staff representative.
Interfax has no evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the "people's republics" of Donbasa announced that 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine had been transferred to the Ukrainian side in the framework of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the NAM army, according to the Novorossia Army, "prevented the Nazi people from attempting, in violation of previous agreements, to remove heavy equipment from the area of the district."
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two VMS in a short-term battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total number of enemy casualties in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupolski) during that night was five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles and more than 120 people killed and injured.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaysk area of Donetsk province.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
The NAM agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrendered arms and ammunition.
The first dozens of troops began to leave the surrounding population on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion "Donbas" Sema Semenchenko, 14 other people withdrew from the cotla on the night of Sunday.
In his Facebook, Sémenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were "held captive by 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 of the Russian Federation's tank brigade," where they were treated well.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have denied reports from the Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation: Russia will take a response if new sanctions are introduced by the EU.
The Russian Federation reserves the right to take action to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, and reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The report from the Russian foreign diplomatic authority states that the "conclusions" of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of the EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unseen support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of "completely free-of-charge allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country," on the agency's website.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for the conditions for a full "dialogue between the parties to the conflict," and stressed the agency.
The agency & apos; s website also notes that there is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has been taking place, as well as a growing number of civilian casualties.
It will be recalled that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next century in the European Union.
In doing so, EU representatives are working closely with United States officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the measures introduced for the period and the degree of rigidity.
The new European Union sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced increased sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Smart ways to save in university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to move on to the second year, has come up with a clever way to reduce costs.
He has developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math analysis book, which is usually worth $180," I got a semester for $10 and a "Chick-Phil-A" cookie, "says Schroeder, 19 years old, who goes to Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet shops and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
The sale of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and is often much cheaper than their purchase.
Nabo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of book rental has doubled since 2011.
The industry's research shows that about a quarter of the books at university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, as said by the Vice-President of Nebo, Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Prices."
This is an introduction to the best way to make a good deal.
Purchase from an Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see at a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 in preiskurant, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used equipment
If you don't mind other people's lesions or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Math analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasaday, 25, a fourth-year-old student from the University of Brigham Young, says he paid 42 cents to Amazon.com for a used copy of the book "Strategic Solutions in the Media: Understanding the Business side of the Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, the director of the College without the Wall at the University of Massachusetts in Emhurst, suggested that students should clarify with their professors whether the previous publications could be used.
Sometimes updates are not essential for classes.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for the purchase of used books.
Procat
The idea of renting textbooks is to think if you treat them well enough, you don't forget to give them back, and you don't want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Math Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines you can be issued for marking, accent and damage.
If you rent the book, remember, if you don't return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
In some cases, such books are rented by acquiring an electronic licence for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Magical Analysis" on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students in literature can often find the most lucrative prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering science can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start school at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of the book, as it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you order on the Internet, says Walt, make sure you see if there's a book in the warehouse.
It's not easy for him to learn.
The delivery of the book that he had acquired had been postponed for four weeks and, after all, he had paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the development fund of the Far East was completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on State support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, told the Interfax that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, established two years ago, was ineffective.
"15 billion roubles remained on deposits," the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested the accelerated adoption of the list of areas ahead of development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of the torts should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, noted by the President, had not adopted, until 1 July, a list of areas ahead of development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also set out the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region & apos; s transport availability and removing infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create the conditions for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to create areas of ahead development that should become competitive with the key business centres of the APT, as emphasized by the President.
It is recalled that it has been previously reported that the area of ahead development can replace the ECO.
Why couldn't "galaxy guards" save cash charges?
Sylvester Stallone's "Unheld 3" has returned less than $30 million of his $90 million budget to the United States, while "The city of sins: a woman worth killing" has only returned $12 million of her $70 million budget.
The "home video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to Tuck a Dragon 2" are also disappointed with the money.
The article on Telegraph's film critic, Robbie Collin, indicates that when it comes to children's films, it may be about the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in history with regard to children's films, and called "How to Teach Dragon 2" "barely" functioning "as a continuation of Fentazi.
However, in the case of films directed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily as a film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that was released in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between May and July 20, 2013 and that year.
The results, which take into account the views of both the film audience and the film critics, suggest that this year & apos; s film production is similar in size to last year & apos; s hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be about changing visual habits and the growing popularity of Internet-based flow services such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on a soon-to-be Disney film, "The Book of the Jungle," said the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what happened before.
In contrast to the current fall in Hollywood cash charges, Netflix & apos; s income from the distribution service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year & apos; s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted a "collapse" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there was a share of truth in his gloomy predictions.
As a number of potential cash hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including "The Auras of Altron," "Minions" and "Jura Park," other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The "People of X" producer, Simon Kinberg, recently called the fall in cash fees just "cycle," saying "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of institutions with Caucasian and medium-Asian food, but for European and Japanese food restaurants, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And, in general, the general peat has so far preferred to replace the prohibited imports with products from Latin America, Israel and China, not from Russia.
"Better to eat a small cucumber than a bad mizarella," the chef of Barlotti's Italian restaurant, Mariano Valerio, is breaking down on the quality of the cheese that the suppliers offer him in place of the Italian.
Mozarella and the burrat cheese ended up in the restaurant first, with a short storage period.
The parmesan should be enough for a few more months.
What do I do?
Do you want to go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorolomov market.
Mariano Valerio makes these eyes clear: shocking memories still don't let him go.
The meat was only on the trolley 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said for our restaurant, we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed.
But the other day, they brought me a fish from the Far East.
That's how it turned out to be dry!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common to Italy for a Russian producer in a wild.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat in the refrigeration chamber is suspended for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang out to be soft so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
And then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
The five-minute walk from Barlotti at the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen is a stop sheet that indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea jets.
The chef of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Arrow bar, Regis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the French oysters have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheese, the restaurant will be bought by Swiss.
In fact, Regis is more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The color kale is 200 roubles!
I said, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make some money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 roubles!
We buy far-east oysters by weight, but they live for 15, 20 years, imagine how much their shell weighs?
For a price, it's a superdelicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of fear for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable size and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know what will happen to them when the supplies of cheese are over.

Passing menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure Russia & apos; s security, which are called mainly product sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and subproducts from poultry, meat, fish, mollusks, milk, yogurt, tomb, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrup.
Restaurants have started to have a cachard with suppliers: food prices have increased, and there is an urgent need to find analog from other countries.
The most important impact will be on expensive mono-kitchen restaurants in France, Italy and Spain, to which products were supplied directly from "mother" countries.
The general had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when, in early 2014, Rosselloznadzor banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers have provided beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 were much more serious.
Indeed, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the Presidential Decree, which remove from the ban of the children of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar maize, peas and peas for crops.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be eased.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist under conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReca, the share of imports in the bonus segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant, the owner of the Restconsultant Agency.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such cooks, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: 10-15% of the course will have to be dropped, half the menu will be reworked.
In mixed-kitchen restaurants, the food is already being replaced, such as a steak from the marble beef on the beefstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," listed by the representative of East-West, Oksana Glibchuk.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
The chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - a salmon, a seed, a trout from Belorussia and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be offset by products from domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironova, the budget network restaurants will be more easily rebuilt than the bonus segment: it is unlikely that Gurmans have been there to distinguish the Italian Mozarella from the Russian one.
Although it is difficult for the Ginza Project, he thinks.
The Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menu.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace it, "says the Miroons.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of the cafe of the Caucasus and Central Asian kitchens stress that products from the former Soviet republics are more than European
But there are many restaurants that will not be affected by the sanctions.
These include institutions with the kitchen of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen," said Khatuna Kolbai, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the Wye Me Café. "
All the cheese is being made for us in Russia, many of the dishes are based on chicken fillet, and we don't use exotic green. "
They haven't taken a single meal out of the menu yet at Kolbai's.
Timura Lansky, the owner of the "Chayhon N1" restaurants with Uzbek kitchen, the sanctions are not embarrassing either: he will only have to change lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia was to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he said.
It is cheaper to get a cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit from the CIS.
However, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
Spanish people don't say that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of the Interior of Uzbekistan, Olimba Artykov, stated that he planned to increase the export of fruit-producing products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan have indicated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The Fastfood restaurants who responded to the "Deneg" request also respond fairly quietly to the sanctions.
The McDonald's press service stated that the location was over 85% and that the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, the head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although it may be temporary to supply vegetables and increase the prices of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teresk," "sanctions products" accounted for no more than 4 per cent at all.
The sanctions were not affected either by the noodle "Wocker."
KFC, Burger King and "Little Potato" did not respond to the "Deneng" request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's location is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are prepared to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East.
On your top of the line.
In the meantime, restaurants complain that higher demand even increases prices for local products.
"The prices for Grablei have increased by an average of 10-15%," for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" twice, "said the restaurant, Roman Roznikowski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will increase by 5-10%, and is recognized by Kolbai.
The East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have been 10-15% expensive since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," a complaint from Sergei Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
The chicken cut was 35% expensive.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it's very unwelcome to raise prices, Rack says.
According to statistics, the increase in general-purpose income during the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he recognizes, but it is not clear how fast: as long as most restaurants have been equipped with food for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the price changes.
But what happens in two months, no one knows.
In the square in front of the city of Moscow, there are 10 balloons decorated by green and tree.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional product festival with a fun "There's Time."
"We were going to make a local food party a long time ago, and that's where the sanctions are, we were in a hurry, we were organizing a festival," one of the organizers says.
The Greek cook Anastaus, behind the stage with the musicians, is preparing macaron salad and domestic candy, and the other day there was a master class for caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers are assured.
The steps are an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Med from Baskiria, Lenin from Salehard, vegetables from the vending "Lenin Sowhose," cheese from an Italian who was engaged by Jay Kloose.
"The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another fish of salmon from the Far East," said the owner of the fish shop, "The People of his own," Philip Galkin.
We have a nerve, a cetu, a cucumber, a horseshoe, a chauffeur, a "royal salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hands, he's not even moving.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian Mozarella with domestic
In the window of his tent, there are shrimp with a "Magadan," a cod, an omul, a muxon, a myth from Crimea, and a scoundrel from the Far East.
Galkin is sure it's time to move on to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the fish catch in Russia in 2013 is over 4 million tons, and a large part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
The "Sky People" has been working since 2012, selling fish through an Internet store, and serving another and a half dozen restaurants before sanctions were imposed, such as "Simple things."
Halkin has now received applications from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, it's hot.
We got frozen, we tried different recipes.
Now we're selling sushi through an Internet store for a million roubles a month.
Our fish is a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared for a line of Philadelphia with a kette.
Unlike the roles of the seed, they have to chew longer, but the knowledge that this fish is our own, domestic, is giving strength.
There's even a paltus and a sea crane on the "The People" shop.
In sushi bars, it is true that the Norwegian salmon is preferred to be replaced by Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains it by making new prescriptions with far-east fish.
"Russian fish have not yet been offered to us," the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Evev gives his explanation.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could take over the liberated niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, it is now more likely that imports from Europe and America can be replaced by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly substitute for illegal imports, as opposed to our farmers.
In other words, the ban will be first and foremost won by large producers of other countries, "said Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry had received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
As a result of the mass out-of-plan inspections, the operations of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the nature of the claims made to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of the visitors' restaurants," said "the money" in the McDonald's press service.
No one actually knows what's going to happen next.
If all is limited to product sanctions, this is one option that can be overcome, as the staff member of the restaurant consulting company says on an anonymous basis.
If they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the script will be different.
"Europrotocol" instead of a GIED
The payments on casco can be made without a GIEACD certificate, so the CBI intends to encourage the introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of the Russian Federation has developed draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain payments on casco without a GIEACD certificate.
This is true only in cases where the accident was made under the "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the road police.
In other words, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, no persons were physically injured, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the "Europrotocol" limit is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that, often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be set up under the "Europrotocol," drivers who have been in an accident have caused a DPS.
In the case of a casco policy, it was not possible to obtain compensation without a GIEACD certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft instruction are intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the "European Protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for casco in connection with an accident that was not performed by GIEACD staff should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol."
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the Casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both DPS and road personnel.
But she's probably not going to get any fun from the car or the insurance.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of an increase in fraud, which may result from the introduction of new rules for the payment of cascades.
In the case of drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome Russian conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait hours for the inspector to make a small accident because it's more reliable.
And it is not known what would be easier to beat the crooks or convince the drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol."
The savings certificate will make the name and irrevocable.
The Minphin wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of irrevocable contributions.
The Minphin is preparing a bill that will prohibit the bearer & apos; s savings certificates.
The tool has recently become more popular, as the rates are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer & apos; s savings certificates are not included in the deposit insurance system, and the bank is cost-effective because it is not necessary to make contributions to the Contributions Insurance Agency (AV).
The situation is that it is planned to take this step because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and that it will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to the AJS, control 98 per cent of the market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow is estimated to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, as explained in the AV, is that the clients of a small bank who have bought such a certificate, if his licence is withdrawn, attempt to obtain money from the AV.
Some investors, without sufficient financial literacy and the purchase of bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments for these certificates, if a bank & apos; s licence is withdrawn, may lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases in which the holders of the bearer certificates had tried to recover insurance compensation through the court, "they referred to the AOC.
Of course, the problem is made up.
It is true that no one will pay to the buyers of certificates, since they do not have the right under the law to be compensated by the State.
If it were to be found that the instrument was not insured in the AV, it would also prohibit metal accounts in which citizens & apos; funds were recorded in the grams of one of the four metals, gold, silver, platinum and paladium.
These accounts are also not included in the deposit insurance system, but they have not yet been sought.
It is likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient securities that can actually be a quasi-money.
However, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and a large number of owners can change the certificate before being cashed.
It is not by accident that the bill states that a savings certificate must be a name-name document which must be kept by the depositary.
In order to give the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early payment.
So there's an analog of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long wanted.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyport and Cardiff
In the weekend, there were protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the middle of Newport on a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff company for what was described as an anti-summit.

Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the terrorist group "Islamic State," reports on 31 August to ITAR-TASS, referring to a decision taken following a meeting of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Supplies will be delivered before the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to provide an additional 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement on this subject in the Bundestag.
Germany has not yet supplied its weapons to "hot spots."
The views of the population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia regarding the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia fired at a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk militia launched a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
It is reported that this took place in the Gulf of Taganrog near the settlements of the Slikina and the Bezymenny (10-20 km east of Maripol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports that two coast guard boats have been fired.
It is stated that the incident occurred today around 4: 20 p.m.

The girl damaged her knee, and the young man fell and his head was bruised.
The officers stayed with a couple of men for the night, and they were raised on the swan on Monday morning.
They were taken by an ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mountain Hospital.
There were two unions.
The Minsk summit negotiations did not resolve the problems for which they had been convened, but created a new format: the first people of the European Union met with the first people of the future of the Eurasian Union.
Even on a worrying issue (the situation in Ukraine is not a matter of delay), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union have for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."
Whether such a structure is effective is not clear; but it is clear who withdrew the merger from this summit.
The questions on this matter were dropped on the evening of 26 August, when the Belorusas, and following them, and other Eurasians with Europeans, saw a new President Lukashenko in the telenvestites.
The Belarusian leader has set an example of a focused mind, that was the behaviour of a man who just broke a jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko helped.
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU Ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf - not just legitimizing the President with a 20-year period.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Byelorussian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Meljantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk as much as it was before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to fade," he said, "Ogonka."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maydan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, modernization dialogues - are listed by the Ogonka interviewer, and international security negotiations have been held with the US.
The States have even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the response of the leadership of Belarus have only overshadowed the process.
On the one hand, Minsk was able to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, a Belarusian leader who, de jure, did not recognize Crimea & apos; s accession to Russia and called for the punishment of the prophecy militia in Donbas with all the utmost severity, did not have a fight with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian air base is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it - and Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful the movement of Lukashenko towards political diversification will be, will be seen in how often Minsk will be hosting EU + TC meetings in the near future.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected from a new relationship.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosiančić just said "Ogonka" that, in the context of addressing the issues of war and peace, the topic was not a priority.
It was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next place to meet the first persons on the Ukrainian issue in a new format.
The Chaplay of the Deggay for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he had been personally requested to do so by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties were not opposed to Minsk being the central venue for meetings, both in Russia-OSEUkraine and at the level of heads of State and high-level representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" is becoming a fully armed European leader who is helping to solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included European Trade and Energy Commissioners, had led to the conclusion: the main thrust of the summit was not the tragic situation on Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting & apos; s schedule of future negotiations on gas supply and on the concerns of the TC countries on the agreement on Ukraine & apos; s association with the EU seems to be more ambitious than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner, Carl De Gücht, nevertheless, pointed out: EU representatives "came to Minsk to find a solution to the political crisis, which has economic implications, not vice versa."
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is "working" for Belarus as well.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which has so far been under sanctions, the long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mizza Research Centre, the ex-candidate for the President of Belarus, Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the potential of Belarus to supply agricultural products in the Russian Federation to circumvent the sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin, at the summit, was chewed by Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes," the Romanchuk "Ogonku," were not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of some way to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are willing to produce in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian supply chains can now be very needed. "
In the view of Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiating site is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic links with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the Moscow sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, and the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million to farmers.
The Belarusian President could invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.
This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Homelessness without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TC + EU format, is being separated, and the Belarusian leader, in a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague, stressed that the new format has been initiated by Kiev.
"It was your offer to meet, without any reason, to discuss, not from the Barachta Bay, to decide, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that had taken place in Ukraine at that time," he referred to the cameras for Petra Poroshenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which was reportedly initially against the Minsk mediation, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic agency, it is hard to stress that Belarus, in organizing EU-TC cooperation on its land, is not for its own purposes, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"This is in the spirit of concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, put forward and promote the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Ogonka" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency where words have recently been carefully chosen.
In Moscow, there may be areas with paid entry.
The Government of Moscow is considering the introduction of pay-for-entry zones as a method to combat the overload of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, and is transmitting M24.ru with reference to the Moscow Transport Castle, Maxime Lissutov.
One option that has successfully proved itself is paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're gonna study it, we're gonna look at it, we're gonna look at it, we're gonna look at it.
To say that some decisions had been taken in that regard before it was too early, "he told the Liquids.
The Zammayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in structure and downloads, is very important to the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction already under way of a central ring road and the addition of the Liquids.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is some example of the fact that the entire traffic is not necessary to pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructure to bypass, there was no need to have a transit traffic in Moscow, "noted the castle.
Maxim Lissutov also stated that the introduction of paid parking had significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities are not planning to stop.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergey Sobynin, participated in the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Boring is a sin.
The Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez film "The City of sins 2: The woman for whom to kill" did not make the revolution that he could have expected.
The first "city of sins" (2005), taken with the minimum but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, has revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary nuar.
Sikwell is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain for modern thinking "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" (if you mean the thesis of the nuara universe and the antithesis-cosmos-comics).
It should now read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
The city of sins-2 is chaotic at both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yeah, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City," although, here, Marv's thunderstorm (Mickey Rourke) is remembered to have finished his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, but to be able to capture - as an ethic national friend - from the air of the knives and other long-distance axes.
But the old people are literally being given the elbows of new men, as if they had broken into the city from some other movie that the audience was asked not to worry about.
So, his story, which the authors have been shameless about in the most interesting place, is at the superintendent player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitte).
It's at the greedy-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green), and for something that's gonna kill her, Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, in the face, is no different from Johnny - especially since people, like other parts of the body, are being taken down by characters with an unbearable regularity - not a problem or even a half-trouble.
They're not people, we understand that they're archetypes of nura: a rock bitch, too sure of himself, a player who was caught in a "copper trap" of sex by a detective, a corrupt, sophisticated senator.
Well, when the archetype walts with the archetype and the archetype goes, it's not a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
The fighting whores from the first "City" continue to hold the circle against the forces of darkness besieging their home slums.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is no-no, and he looks at the light, and it's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem of the "cities of sin 2" is the other.
Frank Miller was good at how a cartoon was talented in bringing together a comic book and a nur, and as a director, he turned over the idea of how to put a comic book on a screen.
Comics and nour are two aggressively opposite "realities."
= = History = = The current form of the comic book was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammet "Blood Jatwa" (1929), "Malta's Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created a canon of nour, then called hard-boiled school, "a" cool school. "
Or a pulp fiction.
The Comics have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes, from the seawoman Popia, a spy-eater who gives him rich power, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy's scout, to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "vigilante."
But in any comic book movie, there was something bad: the prettitious characters were reluctant to turn to an ecan flesh, they were fakes in the "real" world around them.
Simply put, they were completely deprived of "existor."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, a traditional novel - with experiences, patterns, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What are the Forbes, what are Tibo and Rugon-McCara, even the Bolkones and Rostov thinking after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such an affair peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and the criminal - that is, by definition, a marginal one - the novel has risen to the level of a philosophical prose.
Hammet found out on his own skin what it was like to be a front-line nurse.
He was a communist.
As by the way, they were at least close to the comparties and the genre pillars, such as the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, the directors of Jules Dassen, Joseph Lozy, Edward Dmitrik.
So the nur, whose archetype they set, first, is rude and cynical, and second, is purely social.
It's almost an American version of social realism.
The first "city of sins" was a great one, which was unnatural, but organically linked the comic book to the nur.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive without being shy of its graphic nature, rather than pretended to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the world of sale, where the cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered a terrible sadist son, was worthy of Mr. Hammet.
And the painting details, like cut heads, that the sadist was decorating his nest, the feather of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseous representative of the Neonuar.
The city of sins 2 is not even a retreat, but a surrender of the radical stylist of Miller-Rodríguez before the tradition of comic.
It must have been a lot of 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of sins," you feel like you're in a glass ball where the snow falls into a toy clowage.
But most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood swords, but what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about social.
Because it is possible only when, somewhere, somewhere, we sometimes have, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can bring back a girl who's on a curved path or, say, tell the crazy parents that her destroyer is punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city except sin, it is not a sin, but a norm.
Boring like any rule.
The chaos of the "cities of sin 2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice, for the sake of domestic credit, I have given this fresh sin a small but glove.
The characters warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
With regard to the sight, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man's thumbs are broken, it gives a hell of a humor.
Hammett would love it.
French lawyers must "shut up and bring France into order," said the key ally, Frasua Holland.
Mr. Vall called on the deeply divided left forces to "show a warm attitude" towards the attacked socialist President, whose replacements had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister had assured that his Government would not question the disputed 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposals that were fuelling the conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Mcron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his fellow Socialist Party to remain "united" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put a stick in the wheels, coming to a meeting of disagreeing members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future."
Marin le Pe, the leader of the very right National Front, expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that she did not imagine that the new Vall government would last longer than a few months.
François Holland is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Vall, who is forced to gather a new government when the past has not been long.
"And the new one won't last the fall or the winter," said Mrs. Pen's reporters.
She reiterated her party & apos; s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to rule.
The ruling French party was defeated in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front was the first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of being divided into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist from the University of Siance Po, warned that the French would lose their patience quickly if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could be even worse.
"A city without drugs" was left without a lawsuit.
The Sverdlovsky Court of Arbitration has left the claim unheard by the Executive Directorate of the Regional Ministry of Public Administration for the City without Drugs.
The Department intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent charges for the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of Sverdlovskaya Region has left the action of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (MUSGISO) to the "City without Drugs" Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Ekaterinburg Yevgeny Roisman).
The regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent fees for the building.
It is now known that the complainant has not been brought before a court on two occasions, and the decision to refuse the proceedings has been made.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the IGSO Directorate was not able to explain, and the Chief of Legal Affairs, Maxim Titov, did not respond to the phone calls.
The Fund was also unable to reach out.
It will be recalled that this is a mansion that has occupied a fund in the centre of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was taken by ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of Sverdlovsky Region filed an action with the Sverdlovsky Arbitration Court for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the agency required, through a court of law, that the contract be declared to be free of charge by the premises of a monument.
In the view of the MAGISO, the agreement did not contain substantial conditions for the rental of a cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsky arbitral tribunal rejected the action, and an appeal was filed to the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation appeal against the decision with the same court, which was not granted, and the decision was then appealed by the Fund to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court accepted the direction of the board.
In 2013, a new lease contract was concluded, under which the Foundation began to pay the rent again, as described by the head of the city, Yevgeny Roisman.
The rent was paid to 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous district administration has given us this building for free, recognizing our counter-narcotics record, in respect of the fund.
The current administration decided differently, "he said.
Tatiana Droveva, Ekaterinburg
Why would the mayor of Ekaterinburg be asked to leave voluntarily?
On 24 July, a member of the Yecaterinburg Gorduma, a unicoros, Alexander Kosintsev, invited the mayor of the city, the mayor of the city, Yevgenia Roizman, to resign.
A criminal case was brought against a person arrested on suspicion of the murder of a retired member of the Oleg Kinev, a member of the rank of mayor.
How did Eugenia Roisman find a criminal case?
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case of "libel" (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code) had been opened on the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlovsk province, where the Director-General of the Legal Centre for Protection, Anna Filatova, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her of having been involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former husband in her blog.
The mayor of Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will be turned into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is to present his new designs, the press is increasingly leaking on what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to United States media sources, the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of a joint project by Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the dedicated Internet resource Re / code, on 9 September, Apple can, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, making the new smartphone iPhone 6 available for a mobile wallet.
The companies themselves have rejected any comments on this.
This function makes it possible to make a payment on the store's account with a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be carried out by the user on his finger print by means of a Touch ID function.
It is reported that, for the first time, a NFC (near field communication) technology will be introduced into iPhone, allowing for uncontrollable payment by smartphone and appropriate cache readers.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-technology company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced as early as 2004 by Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that were part of the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android, with the NFC function Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced a Google Wallet system that allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and to pay with an Android smartphone.
However, United States experts stress that, despite the large investment of high-technology companies in the promotion of NFC technology, United States rivals are still careful about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
So now the observers are hoping that Apple's entry into this market will make the rivals speed up and make more use of this technology at their outlets.
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Paris's position on the supply to Russia of "Mistreli" remains unchanged
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, said that Paris had a consistent position on the supply to Russia of the "Mistral" helicopter-rich.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August:" Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This decision of the Europeans, not of France, "is quoted by Mr. Nadal" RIA News. "
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy agency replied to a question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would have an impact on the change in Paris's position on the implementation of the contract.
For more information on the supply of helicopter-rich men to Russia, read in the material of the magazine "Ogonek" "Mistral" is almost ours. "
National Security Council of Ukraine: seven soldiers have been killed in the last 24 hours in the area of the force operation
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the fighting zone in the east of the country over the past 24 hours and 25 others had been injured.
The situation in Ilovsky is extremely difficult.
The details will not be made public until the withdrawal operation has been completed.
At the end of the operation, loss data and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of such a situation will be held accountable, "added Mr. Lysenko, refusing to discuss more in detail the situation in Ilovaya, where several Ukrainian battalions have been placed in an environment.
According to the representative of SGBO, "every effort is being made to return the troops who have been taken into custody" is reported by ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from Luganska airport towards the town of Georgyevka.
For more information on the situation in eastern Ukraine, read in the material "I" by Arsen Avakov: the first Ukrainian military personnel left the Ilovaya environment. "
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a market-worth company of $6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise vessels and secured clients of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RC.L.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, and sources reported on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company called Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources requested that they remain uncalled for, as the negotiations are not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, runs 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in subsequent years.
The rerace companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with the U.S. regulatory authorities for primary public interest in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
The Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28 per cent, Apollo had a share of 20 per cent, and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP, owned a share of 8 per cent in the company, as reported at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of the cruise traffic in North America, according to the registration documents at the first public location of Prestige Cruises.
The Crimea television and radio company can receive 250 million roubles of subsidies.
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Federation proposes to allocate 250 million roubles to the State-owned television and radio company "Crimea" in 2014.
As is clear from the draft Mincomcommunication Regulation, which is posted on a single disclosure portal on the preparation of regulations, it is planned to spend "on the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea."
The money will also be used for the purchase of equipment, the repair of the roof and the power supply systems in the building of a radio and television company founded in 1959, and will be reported to RIA News.
Hong Kong & apos; s Democratic Movement activists are ruining the Chinese representative & apos; s statement the day after the election decision was taken.
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing was standing nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People & apos; s Congress on Sunday established a procedure under which only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of the Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of the Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to be on the ballot and has made it possible for the democratic movement to again promise to stop the Hong Kong financial centre by "Occupy Central."
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing Document on China & apos; s control of Hong Kong in June, Democratic Movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city & apos; s business centre and engaged in a sit-in.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People & apos; s Congress, Jang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students stated that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to add 400 hectares of land to the West Bank of the Jordan River, which is owned by the Palestinian Authority.
As BBC says, the decision to attach South Bethlehem's land is related to the wish to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli adolescents in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Forces declared the occupation on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saib Arikat, the world must hold Israel accountable for "continuing settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem."
Putin demands that Kiev begin negotiations on "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin had no intention of implying that the East Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin & apos; s appeal to the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the prophecy rebels was equally consistent with the obvious strategy that he had followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take over and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly-established territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get close to Russia and not to the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Canal, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of the separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Lugana regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the occupied territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that the peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians started campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and while Government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the "prisoner of illusions" reported to ITAR-TASS.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of the society and State status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there," he said.
The sand said that Putin & apos; s words on statehood had been taken into account in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the Eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin press secretary to correct Putin's "wrong interpretation" highlighted the decision of the Russian leadership to behave against the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than the open capture of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much more heavy battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugani regions of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were non-Russians, and the pre-conflict surveys showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats had discussed in international forums would give regional Governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact by transferring to the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link Russia & apos; s main territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and leaf plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, should consider constitutional amendments that would allow the separate regions to have greater control over their financial and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels who are accused of arming and abetting Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to agree with the separatist leaders, as equal, followed new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-supported separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security forces say they are afraid that it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory to Crimea itself.
This has led to extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Maripol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, he called on the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-return," he warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
The EU Summit had not taken certain measures; the leaders had called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 military personnel had entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficult separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, the press secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, told the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly held in Ilovaysk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday on 10 Russian aircraft seized on Ukrainian territory a week ago, and told Lysenko on Sunday.
The naked picture scandal is taking over Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust for hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged by the fact that a number of open photos depicting a naked Jennifer Lawrence have been made available on the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photographs of the star "Hunger Games" by Lawrence and the superstars, including the models of Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, the singer Rianna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michel, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australia's actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Insurance and Melbourne Greco also allegedly had photographs stolen as a result of an iCloud leak.
The name of the celebrities is on list 101.
Edelsten, who made a proposal last month, said, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs should remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
The Greko, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "shameful" and that those who were targeted "feel that they were being invaded."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photos of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two shots, where she is at the naked-breast pool.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Insurance and Actress from the "Forbidden Reception" Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is an obsession of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation for the hacker by tweeting: "To display photographs stolen from a mobile phone is in fact no different from the sale of stolen goods."
It's just from a legal point of view, you can't stand the publication of stolen photos.
There's a potential way to steal a picture of naked celebrities.
The mass break-in of the star accounts may have been made through vulnerability in the "Find My Phone" application.
The potential scenario of events described the resource The Next Web.
On the Github resource, a screenplay was published in Python, which allowed for the selection of the passwords for the "Find My Phone" service by Apple.
This service allows us to track the location of the iPhone.
The same link of the Apple ID and password is used for access to the Apple iCloud cloud, from which celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the backup to recognize the password from the Find My Phone.
The method shall be followed in a consistent manner by all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most common passwords.
The author of the script claimed that there was no limited number of passwords in the Find My Phone service.
When the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to introduce the wrong password, the account should be blocked and reported to the user about the attempted entry.
Because of vulnerability, users have not received any reports of an attempt to identify the password to their account.
The hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access the iCloud.
According to the Hackapp Twitter user, vulnerability was found two days ago on Saturday, and a screening program was written for the selection of passwords.
At this point in time, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was common for many services, but noted that there was no evidence that it was that vulnerability that had been used to access the "stars" account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister's foreign records appeared again.
Although there is no firm evidence that vulnerability was used for the theft of the photos in the Find My Phone, there was previously a wave of malpractice using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, had also previously been hacked into his Twitter.
If the culprits had access to the iCloud described above, the password to the head of government account in the microblogging service could also be stored.
The Next Web was not able to get Apple's comments on vulnerability on the Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-bork.
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a famous Ukrainian athlete, Anne Buriak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet legal information portal.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and asked the Federation of Modern Five to give her the opportunity to speak for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in her personal title, and became the world champion of the mixed estafete, which is one of the new types of programmes in this form of sport.
It also holds the leading positions for the current season.
According to the rules, she would need special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to address the Rio de Janeiro Olympics 2016.
Anna Buriak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the chess player, Ekaterina Lagno, a native of Lvova, who is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), a world of pancakes (2010) and a fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, the athlete won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the Astana World Cup (2013) and the Europe Command Championship in Warsaw (2013).
The UPC has stopped the investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Ventrovo.
The Russian Committee of Inquiry (SSR) has dismissed the criminal case of the Tu-204 flight of Red Wings.
This is reported by the Department's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the brothperson.
The forensic analysis found that the cause of the disaster was the increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to comply with standard landing procedures, and the unintended movement of engines to the high speed of the straight drive.
The "Red Wings" aircraft, which was on the Prague-Moscow flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 while landing at the Moscow airport of Ventrovo.
The aircraft went out of the airstrip and was on fire.
An aircraft commander, a second pilot and a brothperson were killed at the scene.
Two on-board attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where they later died of injuries.
Three more on-board attendants who had been hospitalized with severe bodily harm had received long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle, who was on the road to Kiev at the time of the crash, was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
In the aftermath of the disaster, the Transport Prosecutor & apos; s Office conducted a review at Red Wings, during which many violations were found.
The airline licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelianenko started training at the SIZO.
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Yemelianenko, 33-year-old, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual violence against a domestic worker, has completely recovered from the injuries and has started training.
The Championship reports it.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Yemelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted, and was detained in Tambov on 9 May following a road accident that resulted in a thigh fracture.
Emelyanko, Jr., was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the court had been postponed and the investigation had insisted that the period of detention should be extended until 30 September.
In the event that the fault of the athlete is proven, he is at risk of imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
Lenta.ru remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Yemelianenko's career.
Yemelianenko held his last victory in January this year, losing a technical nokauth to a compatriot, Dmitry Smain.
Alexander is a younger brother of the most famous fighter Fedor Yemelianenko.
The latter is the four-time World Champion of Mixed Combat Arts, the four-time World Champion and the seven-time Russian Champion of Combat Sambo.
The anger was the most universal and functional emotion of man.
The heart of the face is biologically universal for mankind, and every body and group of muscles involved in its creation is not an event, but an additional means of expression of power and threat, and the scientists of Australia and the United States have learned.
They reported on their discoveries in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be briefly read in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The naked expression of the face - the abrasions, the eyebrows, the thin line of the lips, the nostrils - is the same in all cultures and makes it even blind from the birth of children who have never seen it, is noted by the leading author of the study, Aaron Sell.
In a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had emerged for effective dispute management during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he can dictate his conditions, and he can bring it to the other by anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of their other hypotheses: the physically strong are more angry and self-employed, are entitled to impose conditions that are not favourable to others, and they also prefer the power to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner.
In view of the fact that anger is first and foremost a "trade emotion," scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that create angry expression should be more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewees - thereby making them accept their terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer persons where each of the seven elements of the rodent face was present or missing and showed them to the informants.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin did not individually make the face evil, the more physically portrayed by such a person was unanimously recognized by the study.
The human anger, like animals, is a threat: an exaggerated expression of its own power, forcing it to accept and obey.
A man's nostrils are inflated and his lips are set on fire for the same purpose as a frog that is inflated, or a grandmother who shows his fangs.
The "anger" is launched by the respondent's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that best demonstrates to the contrary the consequences of that refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of a rogue face is arbitrary, all of them express the same thing, "noted the anthropologist John Tubi.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed 250 million roubles for the Crimea television and radio company.
In 2014, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget to an autonomous non-profit organization, the Crimea Television and Radio Company.
This is mentioned in the draft Government Regulation prepared by the agency that was consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, the federal budget grants will "cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment."
In particular, it is envisaged that the cash allocated will be used to reequip the studio unit, video, central hardware and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic line (VOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system from the funds allocated.
The grants will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The State Broadcasting Company "Crimea" was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, more than 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula is covered by television and radio.
In 2011, Crimea's television and radio company was licensed to broadcast on a digital basis.
