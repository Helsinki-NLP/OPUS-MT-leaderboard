The white pawn on f3, the black pawn on e6, the white pawn on g4, the black ferz on h4 is a mat.
White: hands on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White people put a rival in the position of zuzwang, making a paw on a6, then black people have only two options: to take a paw on a6, or move an elephant to any other field of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, white men move a pawn from b6 to b7 and put a machine. In the second case, the white pawn takes a black pawn on the same as 7.
