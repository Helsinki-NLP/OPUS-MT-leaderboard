Number of recruits from Ukraine ready to be sent to Donbas
The official representative of the People & apos; s Police of the self-proclaimed Lugano People & apos; s Republic (LDP), Andrei Marocko, stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas in the winter of 2018-2019.
He said that, in that way, Kiev was planning to "do something to complement the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the army of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to a low number of units," Maročko said, quoted by RIA News.
He also did not exclude that the real figures of the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a Joint Force (UF) operation.
This measure was intended to strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in the resolution of the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the NCD, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The NCD authorities have described what has happened as a terrorist attack.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian special services.
The U.S. authorities forced the Mask to leave the post of Chairman of the Tesla Board.
The American businessman, Ilonon Mask, will leave the position of chairman of the board of directors of his company Tesla, at the request of the United States authorities.

According to CNBC, a pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows the Mask to remain in the lead position in Tesla.
In so doing, he is required to pay $20 million and to leave the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is stated that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it was reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused the Mask of misleading shareholders with a claim that there was sufficient money to buy the company's shares, and had brought a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla's $420 stock for a thing, but he never did.
After tweet, the company grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being captured by the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt has thus commented on the difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to believing in a European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave will not be reduced, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity, "said the Minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to withdraw from the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, and noted "Gazette."
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the negotiations on Brexit had reached a stalemate.
It commented on the outcome of the EU informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 after a referendum.
The United Kingdom & apos; s withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together once London has left the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Ilonon Mask is forced to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilonon Mask settled their fraud dispute.
CNBC News reports this.
According to the television channel, as part of the agreements reached, Masku will have to leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors.

It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.

At the same time, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.

He is the head of SpaceX's space corporation, Neuralink's neurotheological company, and the developer of Tesla's electric carres, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla Ilona Mask for a possible ransom from the company because of his Twitter report.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all the shares on the market at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the $420 stock was estimated "due to the importance of this number in the marijuana culture," previously reported by the Bloomberg Agency with reference to the Co-Director of Security of the Commission, Stephen Peykin.
However, Ilonon Mask subsequently refused to buy his stock.
Commenting on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission & apos; s legal action against him, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by those claims.
"Honesty is the most important value of my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against Mask, claiming financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the business posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder stated that a businessman's tweets were misleading, which forced Tesla's shareholders to buy paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the indiscretion of Ilonon Mask had led to sharp fluctuations in course.
In September, Ilona Mask also accused the head of Citron Research of trading.
However, if Mask could not settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be at risk of being removed from the management of the company and even from the prison.
This was reported, inter alia, to CNBC by former Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.
The mask is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

On September 30, 1928, that is, 90 years ago, the British bacteriological Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The opening of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought the Fleming world's glory and made it a Nobel laureate.
By the way, penicillin was not the first opening of Fleming.
A few years earlier, when he was cold, he sowed a cream from his own nose into Petri's cup (this is a glass lid that is testing with bacteria), and a few days later he found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
They found penicillin in almost the same way by accident.
The name of Fleming was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in human history.
Its discovery, in the view of many scientists, has changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered to be incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangreen...
When, shortly after the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "He has done more than dozens of divisions to break up the fascism and release of France."
Experts estimated that the opening of the world's first antibiotics had saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
He died of a heart attack in his home in London in 1955.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous London Cathedral of St. Paul.
Where, by the way, my wife and I have been paid attention to this by a vocabulary Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming was growing up, and we were able to see it in the most unexpected place in Spain's capital.
There, near the main arena for the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most prominent Spanish matadores have set up a monument for a man who, in their view, was saved by the lives of hundreds of outstanding corrides.
By the way, this, in my view, is a very interesting work of apron that I found there in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all.

Trump told me about the "love" in Kim Jong Eun.
From mutual violence, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK went almost to each other's love, making a joke about Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump was a good joke about his success on the North Korean crisis.
With mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries now have so much of a relationship that they are almost in love with each other, the President of the United States noted.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main challenge to foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so started a relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that he could not even reach the country's leadership - there was just no answer.
At that time, the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "great letters" to the White House, marking Trump.
Trump recognized that, at the beginning of his work, he was also "cruel" to Kim Jong-eun, which was, however, mutual.
But now their relationship is so much that the leaders have "fallen in love with each other."
In doing so, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the United States media would exhaust them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang had recently stopped nuclear and missile testing, as well as closing down military sites.
All of this is a reward to his administration, I'm sure the American President.
In the past Tuesday, Donald Trump was lewd about Kim Jong Eun from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate the tension.
However, Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore

A positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers.
However, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that since the Singapore summit, the US has sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang has rejected them, calling them "gangster."

Nice called for the removal of "Moscow language by Ukrainian product."
A Ukrainian child writer and a fighter for the purity of Laris Nietzy's mother tongue called for the removal from Ukraine of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language."
To do so, she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural natie."
His views on "the feasibility of eliminating the Russian language in Ukraine" were shared with the Ukrainian publication "Observer."
She said that the relevant Ukrainian product was being prepared - even though it was already available and was continuing to develop.
In time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that the Russian language had previously been widely used on television and radio, but that there was little left in public space.
However, in the view of the Czech Republic, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the authorities' actions prohibiting the use of the Russian language are, in its view, only "an extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
The experience of the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in the children's camp in Karpathah, where she was invited to work, was previously shared by Nice.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookstores, one of which had a cashier in Russian.
Without seeking his own, Nice threw a change into the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia," calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing names.
The name "Rusu" had recently been stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of a writer could not be avoided even by the Ukrainian Security Service: when she came there and heard the staff spoke Russian to each other, she was a scandal and left with a door.

"This is a difficult game, a serious man-to-man conversation, and it has brought its fruit: two balls were laid and two were not missed.
"You missed a few games because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today? "
"If it took 90 minutes, it's all right!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of power to keep it from happening.
So, doctors and physiotherapists Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What do you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after victory and recovery, it's easier, and the mood in the community is good.
Now we have a white stripe, but at first there was a black one.
We must continue in the same spirit and be happy with the cheerleaders. "
"Did you miss the game for the time you didn't go out on the field?"
"There is one, a little bit of a miss, 'cause it's really a bad situation.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and we were happy with the cheerleaders.
And the rest is secondary. "

Citizens are asked, in a referendum on Sunday, to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which is consistent with the name of the northern Greek region.

It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia."

Russia's decision to supply C-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Syria is a timely step.
This view was expressed by the head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mualem, in an interview with the RT television channel, which was broadcast on Sunday.

The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that C-300 is a defence system, not an offensive system, and is designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to hold early elections to the Armenian Parliament in 2018
The elections for the Armenian Parliament could be held in 2018, as stated by the Prime Minister of the country, Nicole Pashinyan.

Nicole Pashinyan added that early elections were "a demand of the people," as well as part of the Government's programme for which Parliament voted.

The charge for a Dagestan deputy was news.
The Soviet District Court of Mahačkala detained a member of the People & apos; s Assembly, Dagestan Rajab Abdulasov, who was suspected of participating in a criminal community that had made a disability for bribes, for two months.
I have learned the details of the investigation, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazan Abdulasov Rajab Abdulatov, has now contributed to the criminal activities of the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise, Magomem Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the investigation and investigation activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the Bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles for that purpose.
In the case of Magomem Mahachev, other directors and staff of the regional medical and social assessment offices under his authority, criminal proceedings were initiated under article 210 (establishment of a criminal community using and participating in an official position), article 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), article 292 (service fraud) and article 159 (fraud in a particularly large amount) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, Rajab Abdulatov joined the criminal community at the end of 2013, aware of the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his associates involved in the theft of the Pension Fund.
As the head of the Office of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagesta and with links to State authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as with his relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatov, the investigators are of the view that "the activities of other members of the criminal community have been carried out, and that they have established contacts with officials of State bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomem Mahachev and his position as head of the federal administrative institution" General Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan, "have organized the illegal identification of persons with disabilities."
Following the announcement of the information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being charged to me today, for me, is new, I don't know it at all," he said.
The Court arrested a deputy from "One Russia" not for 10 days before the charge was brought, as was the case with previous high-level Dagestan officials, but for two months immediately, since article 210 of the Criminal Code is in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the investigation to be charged, up to 45 days from the time of detention.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Russia & apos; s theme was virtually non-existent in a negative way.
The head of the committee of the Federation Council for International Affairs, Constantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly a success for Russia and does not exclude that it can be a turning point in the Russian Federation & apos; s view as an integral part of the solution to global world problems.
"The unique nature of the present 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric to which we have become almost accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in a more sophisticated order," said the Senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, but, along with Ebola, climate change or terrorism, Russia had been among those, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which had been expressed in a sufficiently unanimous manner."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's topic in a negative way was virtually non-existent."
"If you look closely at the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Foreign Minister of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly accurate," the politician noted that Russia "was no longer a wall that was being trained to be hit by a tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfed Committee of Practice does not exclude that this indicates a trend that he believes will "make available the present session of the [UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, two, three."
"I do not rule out that this session in some sense may be a turning point," said Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs with Russia's connection."
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"It is not yet, unfortunately, Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be required over time," added a parliamentary.
This is because he believes that there is "an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of today."
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going through a point where the movement is no longer a move back, it's going to be a move forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of the world, was largely uninterested, the situation is now different," said the Chairman of the Committee of the United States.
In his view, this is because "the so-called new liberal order that represents the West has no answer to questions on how to address world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, migration."
"Here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," expressed the confidence of Kosachev, stressing that he considered "this session to be a good session for the work of the Russian delegation, a good one for Russia."

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that no military force will be required in the Syrian province of Idlib, as stated by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Mualem.
However, he said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of the Russian-prohibited organization Jabhat Al-Nusr from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, and reported to RIA News.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the negotiations with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On 17 September, Putin and President Rejep Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish, by 15 October, a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea youth team.

She said so in a video address to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suchchenko FSB.
She said that, on those days, an action was being taken under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, which had launched a hunger protest demanding the release of Kremlin's prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural people, among them there are people who know you who are hungry, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other Kremlin political prisoners, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview, no place where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authority, all of us, have demanded that the Kremlin be put under pressure, that Putin be pressured with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all of Kremlin's political prisoners and the children illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea, "Gerachenko said.
It also expressed confidence that the tests would make every Ukrainian "more evil, more stringent in the protection of Ukraine's national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is evil."
After all, a correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Suchchenko, was arrested by Russian security forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage with the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushenko to 12 years of strict-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found that verdict to be lawful.
The Russian prison authorities had granted the last request of the Ukrainian before he had been taken to the colony.

Wachtang Kikabadze on cancer
Now a lot of artists are talking about how they managed oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the history of popular people about the victories of cancer gives hope to many.
The famous actor Wachtang Kikabadze admitted that he was only alive because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which was a sentence.
"It's like I was hit on the head with a hammer from the bottom.
I fell.
I lost my orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
We started testing, and it turns out it's bad, and the artery's not missing blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big, big, rogue cyst in my head, and they had an emergency operation.
And during the surgery, the whale doctors saw a tumor, "said Kikabadze on" One. "
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say good-bye to the kumir on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife did not let her bury a living actor, she believed she could handle the disease and had not left her husband's bed for over a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Always, when I had critical situations, she was there for the rock, "an actor confessed.
The actor managed to deal with the disease, and now he's living happily in his house in central Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his disease, of the untimely death that this is all about on the Web.
The creators of the Peacemaker website introduced Peter Siyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, into the section "Purgatory."
The reason was "an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring countries learned of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine," as well as of "participation in the organization of provocation aimed at the mass violation by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian legislation."
We note that, before Siyarto, the estate of Kijevo-Pechere Lavra Pavel and the successor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs), Onufrii, took place in Purgatory.
Their opposition to the receipt of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church was a reason.
Previously, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities have named the sum of the "golden parachute" of the Zonezh Governor.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region, Yuri Agibalovu, was made under the Regional Law on Public Posts.
However, the real amount of the "gold parachute" released from the position of a vice-official was several times less than the amount expressed in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional Government.
According to the law, the salary for the post of Agibalov is 11,189 roubles.
In this way, it was emphasized in the press service that the one-time payment was less income tax of 223,892 roubles, rather than the 1 million roubles written by the media.
The employee has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
This pension and one-time payment are made to him immediately after his dismissal and have been explained to the RIA News Agency in the Government of the Region.
At the same time, the payment of the pension supplement to Agibalov was suspended on appointment to a public office and his salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
The Governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, who won the election, took office on 15 September.
Agibalov was released as a result of the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other government officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram Canal, Nezigar, published documents that indicated that Agibalova, who had left the post of Vice-Governor, had paid a severance benefit of 23 salaries and, two days later, he had again received a similar post without a "vino."

On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that young people were being masturbated and were provoking the harmful information they found on the Internet.
This is at the level of educational institutions and the family, and a deputy has added.
Gennady Onishchenko, a member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Says Moscow"):
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done to explain the Paguba, because there is a risk of a child's sexual health, both a boy and a girl.
The problem is that children are growing up early enough, and there are further large scissors between their sexual maturity and the possibility of formal intersex contact.
According to Onishchenko, "bigotry," silence of "sexual issues" and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing were obstacles to solving the problem.
The doctor is sure that a lot of teenagers are suffering from anonism.

The AG was the second most popular in Germany.
The anti-immigrant "alternative for Germany" strikes another record of popularity, and Angel Merkel's ratings fall.
It appears that the German people have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country an ambitious target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most recent social surveys show that the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling Merkel and Zehofer bloc are being weakened.
This week, the ADG won another record, rising to number two in the popular sympathy rating.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17% popularity, have been able to bypass the social Democrats, who have about 16%.
The gap in one percentage point could be reduced to a statistical error, but the current fact that a small group of Euroskeptics had been created by AG in 2013 had become a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall set-off is still holding the HSS / HDZ ruling unit, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points - as early as April, the support of the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Today, 48 per cent of the Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Let us add that following the social Democrats, the "green" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%) were placed.
The evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which included members of the Christian-Democratic Union.
The Group was initially opposed to government, but at first, it dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the weak EU economies, and did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German mark and a complete withdrawal from the EU.
In the context of the deepening immigration crisis, the AG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party that took over the Euroskeptics' niche and began to criticize the Government for failing immigration policy.
In the most recent parliamentary elections in 2017, the AG was able for the first time to break into Bundestag, with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" will have a seat in the European Parliament.
Published a video with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens "a nation of bolts."
The author of the two books, The Pope Drozdov, is a live author of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, who has admitted that he considers his compatriots "a nation of fools."
They believe in TV and they don't read much.
As the Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and acceptance since we were children," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio of the Inéroquine has begun to fight against literature that has little to do with criticizing the Kiev authorities by prohibiting the entry of 201 publications.
Manchester City won Brighton and took over as the leader of the APL.

The Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse - a magazine behind the wheel.
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armor.
Roshel Senator APC apocalypse
In the subject of apocalypse, money is not only made by the producers of video games, film and book publishing.
The new niche is now being developed by the car companies.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its vocabulary of the Senator APC apocalypse.
In a time free of fantasies, this company's engineers are building armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not comfortable but are safely placed in a full-scale armor capsule.
This bunker, or you can't call it a design, because its level of reservation is in line with the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of the strong Ford Super Duty pickup.
His head, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenade and anti-personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that passengers are not affected by even an explosive wave from a shell that exploded near the vehicle, the car compartment is equipped with special amortization seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe vision, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of circular-view cameras with a night-vision function, as well as a check-in armored towers on the roof.
There's no weapons in the car.
Front part of the armored parlor of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order to ensure that the weight of an armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong, tensile, 6.7-litre turbodiesel engine, the full power of which is transmitted to four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-step automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of being stuck in an armored apocalypse by Roshel Senator APC.
It will be possible to see an armored apocalypse, Roshel Senator APC, at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C. in October.
The time of death of the universe is called
The universe is about 140 billion years old, 10 times the age of the observed world, about 13.8 billion years.
The study of an international team of scientists is available in the ArXiv.org e-prizes library and is aimed at publishing in the Journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, and reports to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The experts came to this conclusion by watching the Subaru telescope with the help of a HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera after about 10 million galaxies.
By monitoring the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working under the standard cosmic model of the world & apos; s CDM (& quot; Cold Dark Matter & quot;), estimated the pace of the expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that observations had provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the recording of the European space telescope Planck had clarified the limitations on the parameters of the & quot; CDM & quot;.
In July, scientists simulated the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments for the world to cease to exist after 22 billion years as a result of the great gap.
Another attempt to bring together the initiators of the pension referendum failed.
The possibility of obtaining the people & apos; s opinion on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of a federal-wide initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different language of the issues (all of the Centrizberk registered five language).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single action group and to ask the Russians: "Do you want to see the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension raised by the law on pension as of 1 July 2018?"
The language was registered by a group of volunteers, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legal.
The majority of the participants were members of the "Fair Russia" member Ili Sviridov (six subgroups) and KPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voroneza and Orenburg.
Sviridov had previously told the Vesdomites that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who is the head of the volunteer sub-group (which was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said "The Vesomites" that he did not receive invitations and did not plan to come, "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."
The blues singer Otis Rush died.

The Admiral has caused us great problems.
Zinatula Bilaledinov: The Admiral has caused us great problems.
The Chief Coach of the "Ac Barsa" Zinatula Bilaledinov summarized the results of the KHL regular championship against the "Admiral" (4: 2).
"It was a hard game, a difficult game.
The confederate fought with dignity, created a great deal of trouble for us.
I'm glad we played well in most of them today.
I told you that once the goals will come, the important thing is that we work on it.
And what we won is also very important. "

That's why it was a decision, "that's what Bilaledin said.
Ilonon Mask will leave the post of head of the Tesla Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask will be required to leave the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of CEO of the company, report to AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
The regulator had previously filed a lawsuit against Ilonon Mask - the officials considered that he had misled Tesla's investors because the businessman had allowed the company to buy all its shares at a high price - $420 per paper.
In the "Loko" game, "Ahmat," Turbin's mistakes were like a horns of abundance.
A former general-union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of an arbitrator, Yevgeny Turbin, in the 9th round of the Russian championship, "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" - and addressed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Eugenia Turbin in the "Lokomotive" game, "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his unsuitability for the Russian Prime League's trial.
I am surprised that the fifth round of "Spartacus" - "Dinamo," not the Turbin itself, nor the leaders of the DCI have made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private miscarriages of gross practices falling out of the horns of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of the railway's Eder, a human rights defender, "Ahmata" Rodolfo, is being put down by his hands in his fine area.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty on it.
- How do you appreciate the Idov episode, which was 82 minutes away when it seemed like the ball was in his hand?
- I think there was a premeditated game by the lawyer in his prison square.
Turbin was right next to the moment, and he saw the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the stand-by Judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and the penalty was not appointed.
So the match account is distorted, and the sports justice has been trampled.
It was the same time that a court of law, in terms of its terms, had put out and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest's lawyer, Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykowyk, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
You should have shown me a second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after a double-standard match that some teams were being punished for such violations as the Idov episode, and some were not.
What do you think of the football player's words?
- Depends on what's meant by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
So the arbitrator doesn't give a second penalty to the other gate.
This is the principle that is being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who's playing.
When I was on Saturday, the Lokomotive and the Ahmata had serious concerns about Turbin's work, because the team was hurt.
Matt Damon played a rape charge with Judge Cavanaugh at SNL's start.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the United States Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The United States Supreme Court candidate had previously drawn attention to his emotions and details of his stories in an interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Cavanaugh, for example, has repeatedly confessed to his love for beer, but has stated that he has never been drunk before being immemorial.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh stated that he was a virgin at that time.
These moments also beat Damon.
All I did was drink a lot, and I didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, most drunk virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows that, "said the judge in charge of Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh was previously elected the highest judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found his cloned dogs having a strange behavior.
The American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her dead dog are acting completely different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, the [clones] look like her, but it's impossible to clone a soul, "he stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Stryzand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, a cat-de-tulaar, named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the dog of Chihuahua, named "Miracle Milly" ("Miracle Milly"), which was called the world's smallest dog, was cloned for 49 times.
The specialists are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US was thinking of a maritime blockade on Russia because of oil and gas supplies.
In the US, we can start a sea blockade on Russia to take advantage of the world energy market.
The United States authorities have fought so hard for the success of the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
The United States Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, reported on the possibility of a maritime blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Department of the Interior does not carry out police but has civilian functions, including natural resources policies.
Therefore, Zinke & apos; s statement had come within the competence of his office, although it had not been deprived of political colour.
In an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinka stated that, through the United States Navy, maritime routes in the Middle East region were controlled and could block them if necessary.
It was clear from Zinke that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russia's supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion's share of its income from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in the region, Zinke is sure.
The Minister has made it clear that the US is still looking forward to leading the world's energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to thwart Russia and Iran, and the maritime embargo on trade routes is an acceptable measure in that direction, Zinke believes.
The Kalmytsk director received good reviews of the festival.
Our countryman, an actor of the Gogol Centre, Yevgeny Sangaghiev, and his film, "Harmony," were given special mention of the members of the jury of the sixth "Movement" debute festival, held in Omsk.
The name of the festival degree states that "it is a signal for the immediate response of the major industrial players of the visual film."

The main prize in this competition program was "Jana is Anya on the contrary," a director's debut by the actress Yana Gladkov.
The emphasis of the National Film Festival of the "Movement" is on young movies, but not on the age of the producers, but on their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
And the graduate of the P. Chonkushov and RATI-GTIS Yevgeny Sangaghiev, the Estonian School of Arts, met all of these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative and, in his creativity, he is seeking new, unconventional forms of expression.
More than 300 Syrians left the Idlib de-escalation zone per day
The Idlib de-escalation zone in Syria left 301 people per day, including 141 children, on the evening of 29 September at the Centre for Reconciliation of the warring parties.
The evacuation took place through the Abu al-Duhur humanitarian corridor.
The centre also reported on the continuing situation of de-escalation in the zone.
For example, the attack on the Makanis al-Duwayri area in Aleppo city killed Syrian military personnel.
Earlier, the Syrian opposition, commenting on the resumption of rocket and bomb attacks on areas in northern Syria, stated that Moscow and Damascus had launched a military operation to "roam" Idliba.
The islanders are being called upon to kill quickly - MK Sahalin.
In the Sahalin region, a campaign is under way to immunize the population against influenza.
The media in the island region call on the inhabitants to be more active and not to ignore the recommendations of the doctors.
This year, 219,000 people in the region are to be vaccinated, including at least 70 per cent of all children.
To date, 49 thousand Saharans and chicken have been vaccinated.
More than 10,000 visitors attended the South Sahalin Children & apos; s Hospital.
According to medical professionals, the most vulnerable are children from six months old, transport workers, educational and medical staff, and those who are more likely to be in contact with a large number of people.
All of them can get the flu vaccine free of charge.
Nor are people with chronic diseases, pregnant women and students paid for the injection.
Boeing's tyres were broken when they left Osh to Moscow.
The Kyrgyz "Boeing" was unable to fly from Osh to Moscow because of the right-hand-chassis tyres that had taken off.
The aircraft had 147 passengers on board.
They were not injured because the pilots were able to react and stop a fast-growing plane.
People went to their destination on another flight.
The Director of the Civil Aviation Agency, Kurmanbek Akishev, reported that a commission had been appointed for the incident and that he was transmitting "Interfax."
Supersound passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be supplied for serial production
The series production of supersound passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was said by the Director-General of the Zhukovsky Cyril Sipalo Central Aerodynamic Institute.
He said that the scientific centre was working on supersound issues, both within international consortia and in cooperation with the Minremtrade.
"It would take us two or three years to get a technology demonstration, as well as another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine that would allow transport on the grounds of our home country," Sipalo added.
He explained that Russian experts now have a question about how to make the technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
In early September, a PAO-Tupolev aircraft developer announced that pre-project work on a supersound passenger aircraft had been completed, and it was estimated that the aircraft would be able to develop a speed of up to 1,900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy Director-General of the Valery Solosobov Company.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He reported this on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of the Columnist Washington Post that Putin & apos; s aggression against Ukraine had resulted in a Ukrainian association.
"In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine and NATO membership supported 16 per cent of the Ukrainians.
It's more than 54% now.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, Ukraine & apos; s European integration and accession to the EU supported 33 per cent of Ukrainians.
It's 74%.
Who did this?
Putin, "said Poroshenko.
Therefore, thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more prepared to protect European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire, "the President of Ukraine stressed.
As the FACTS wrote, President Peter Poroshenko was in the United States at the end of September 2018 and participated in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.
He also visited the grave of a great friend of Ukraine, Senator of the United States (1987-2018), John McCain.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
The former captain of "Chelsea" and the England team, John Terry, are about to attend the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartacus" (0: 1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I'm following.
I've been watching him a very recent time, and I was interested in looking at him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a cheerleader, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize once again for the decision, "Terry says the Chelsea cheerleader site.
We will recall that Rostov, with 18 points, was ranked third in the tournament table, and Spartacus was placed on the fifth line with 15 points.
In the next round, red and white on October 7, they will play with "Enisei," and the Trust Valery Carpina will be accepted by "Orenburg" a day earlier.
The expensive violin was taken to the pawnshop for a priceless.
When a man brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville (Massachusetts), a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for an old and unprofitable instrument.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked for an expert's advice.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Gallano and is estimated at $250,000.
The only link to the violin is estimated to be between $16,000 and $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had not been stolen so long ago from one of the city's residents and that the instrument had been returned to the legitimate owner.
It is not yet known how the violin reached the person who took it to the pawnshop, but does not include any previous collisions with the law.
The manager says that now all the pawnshop-producing violin will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RRT, we are facing an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will receive "Rostov" at its Tushin stadium under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man known to be not a "people's team" at all.
The special picnic of this meeting is that clubs now have an equal number of points, 15, and they share 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-fetched Zenita and being in one point from Krasnodar, who is playing with Dinamo tomorrow.
In the red-white area, the club is now in a difficult position: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, and in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly hit Rapidu, and recently left the house of Ahmatu.
After taking a DCI from a just one, Spartacus, with a minimum score, won the Chernamorc Cup, and it is early to say whether Russia's most popular club is approaching a solution to the crisis.
The "Rostov" three games in a row could not win, but the defeat did not know five.
Let's see if Carpin can extend the win-win series with such a fundamental match.
The previous meeting of the Karp Rostov with Spartacus ended in favour of the capital team.
The beginning is at 7: 00.
Indonesia is being shaken by the aftermath of a powerful tsunami.
In Indonesia, where an earthquake had taken place a few days ago, which had triggered a three-metre tsunami, meteorologists observed more than 170 aftershocks.
Maginitas was 7.4, mostly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reporting a television channel "Russia 24."
The number of deaths was over 420 and more than 500 were injured.
The authorities informed the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later it was cancelled.
The thing is, the instruments didn't record a wave approach.
The fate of dozens of other people who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday in one of the coastal towns of Palu, which had been most destroyed after the podium, is still unknown.
London has been charged with charges against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, as stated by British Secretary of Defence Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, and he stressed during his performance at the conference of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, the enemies are operating in the grey areas with the help of cyber and false news, and the Minister has added.
But the largest is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have been repeatedly denied and transmitted to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use the chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned a story of poisoning ex-Colonel GU Sergei Skrypal, who was convicted of espionage in favour of the United Kingdom, and his daughter, Julia, in Salsbury, in March this year.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change of name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, a strong supporter of the renaming of the Republic into Northern Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring the preparations for the referendum and today & apos; s vote.
The head of the monitoring mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronwei about the organization of the work of the observers:
Approximately 100 teams have travelled around the country to monitor the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to the closure of polling stations, then counting votes and writing protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams have been working in the country to monitor the preparation for voting, the work of the media, the implementation of the electoral campaign financing law and the organization of the referendum.
"Some 500 foreign observers are closely following the voting.
The observer groups shall record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions so that they may be presented in the final report. "

The genitalia of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a significant role in understanding.
On the International Day of the Translator, 30 September, a professional interpreter, Barbel Sachs, told him about this.
She has been involved in Russian and English transfers for more than 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events in peace, and the Russians, as they say in the saying," long, long, quick. "
But it seems to me that, for understanding among peoples and for the work of an interpreter, it is not an important role, "the expert said in the commentary on" RIA News. "
According to the interpreter, it is enough to know history for the two countries to be left alone.
And in the future, Sachs noted that Germany had no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there's a lot of things that determine our common destiny, "she said.
In the previous day, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, stated that the country was trying to "link" with and support Russia.
She said that the North Flow 2 gas pipeline project, which was being built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the Baltic Sea floor, was particularly important for Berlin's mania.

Putin has appointed a new Chief of the President's Office for Foreign Policy.
Vladimir Putin, by decree, released Alexander Manjusin from his position as head of the office of the President for Foreign Policy.
Igor Neverov has been appointed to that post.
Mr. Manjosin has been in charge of the President's Office of Foreign Policy since 2004.
One of the reasons for his departure was the "I" source close to the Kremlin, which referred to personal circumstances, noting that there had been no substantive claims in terms of the quality of the work under the head of the office.
Igor Neverov was previously head of the Second European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In 2009-2014, he was Russian Ambassador to Sweden.
The Russians have donated one rouble for a low-wage deputy.
In Yekaterinburg, the "Human" charity fund opened a fund-raising for a member of the State Duma, Vera Ganzi, who complained of low wages.
The campaign can be tracked on the organization & apos; s website.
The "Human Charitable Foundation" expresses the hope that we will be able to save the service of the people all over the world.
We ask all the unpleasant people to give them a chance to live and a happy future!
All funds collected will be transferred to the poor in person.
God save you! "said the fund's message.

The reports on the assistance received are published on the Fund's Vkontakte page, where the organizers issue the remittances.
The most frequent donations are one ruble and 50 kopeks.
At the time of publication, the Russians had donated 1633 roubles to Vera Gansa.
The fund-raising was opened on 28 September following a low-income complaint by Ganzi.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy was 380,000 roubles, from which nothing was left, so it was necessary to spend money on a credit card.
Ghanaia visited that parliamentarians were not compensated for representation costs.
Subsequently, in the State Duma, they stated that they would consider the possibility of paying the representative costs to the deputies.
The "Golden sink" of the San Sebastian festival received the film "Between the Two Seas"
The painting "Between the Two Seas" (Entre dos aguas) of Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta is recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The tape was awarded the main award of the festival, "The Golden sink."
The Norwegian actress Pia Tjelta won the "Silver sink" award as the best actress for the "Blind Blade" tape.
The best actor was named by the Argentine Dario Grandinetti for the film "The Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benhamin Nighstate, was the best director.
The "Evening School" comedy was led by an American boxing office.
The "Evening School" comedian, who debuted at American cinemas last Friday, made $28 million for his first weekend.
This result allowed the unwritten painting of Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the United States boxing office from 28 to 30 September.
In the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line of Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, it is rather tangible that the other new Western rotor, the Smallfoot cartoon, is a curious story of meeting a charming yeti with a human being, in which the main hero has never believed.
The Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig project raised $23 million for their start-up weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted a 20-25 million-per-weekend tape.
As for the sum of Smallfoot's fees, they currently amount to $38.6 million (since it has debuted in 50 countries), the most active being Mexico, which has executed a 3.6 million film.
The three most powerful people this time have closed the children's story of "Secrets with Hours" from the master of the horrors, Eli Roth, who has finally proved that the director can make a quality movie for an audience of 12 +.
In his second week, John Bellers made $12.5 million worth of a book with a charming Jack Black with Kate Blanchett, bringing the world's total to 53.8 million.
Despite the drop-out from top three, it continues to be a surprise with the sign "+" of a trillion from Blake Livley and Anna Kendrick, "A simple request," that in 17 days in the United States, the picture of Paul Figs, from which some unrealistic financial performance was not originally expected from the word "whole, raised $43 million (including $6.6 million from 28 to 30 October) and now has a total of $62.9 million.
The last representative of the first five this week was the "Nuni curse" horror, which collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
The Spin-off of "Zlazlaatia" has a total income of $330 million in the 24-day account of American (and not only of course) cinemas, and has recently been the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two ribbons of the abominable Annabel doll.
A new member of the genre, the Halfest debutante, is one of the main youth horns of the year, just following the horror of Corin Hardy's past weekend.
In his first weekend, the children of a famous monster (and with a recent director), Gregory Pletkin, who had previously worked in a number of large horrone projects, including "Happy Day of Death," which is a very similar place to the Hellfest, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh was "Crazy Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems not to think of falling out of the top 10 of the American boxing office: a romantic comedy that has been on screen for the seventh week, as of September, is the sixth in the most cash tape of the genre in history, with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that the domestic market has made so far, with a total of 218.8 million ribbon revenues.

Let's add that next weekend in the United States will be all about collecting the long-awaited "Vienna" with Tom Hardy, who, without doubt, will have no problem taking the lead in the American boxing office at the end of the first weekend of October.
From the other prime week ahead, we should point out the musical melodrama "The Star was born," the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today.
The Chief Coach of Vitaja, Valery Belov, on the defeat from Siberia (3: 4) in the KHL regular championship.
"The colleague was talking about" Siberia "fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," "Belov says the official website" Vitia. "
"I hope they will also support it, because now almost every game is full of a stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, I think God was helping Siberia today because they were very, very, very wrong, especially our leaders.
In fact, we lost a micro-game of 0: 3 to our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to get out of this game, although there were moments.
But still, I'll take the blame.
Because they must have missed something in preparation.
It was a different team compared to the last game. "
"It's an ugly mumbling."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on "Voice."
The audience of the "Voice 60 +" show accused Leonid Agutin's mentor of "a flawless and sickle-up."
When he first heard his father, Nikolai Agutin, in a blind audition, had many hopes that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But the son's feelings took over, and he chose a relative to his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but they pardoned the mentor to be biased at the first stage.
But the "joke" has been long, and the star's father has taken the place of more worthy performers without any justification.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were outraged by the mumbling of the unimaginable and frank passage of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I had no idea that Agutinu would have had the strength and the conscience not to carry his father to the end of his first place, "which Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin had said in" The Man of TV. "
In the meantime, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "leaked" the beautiful performers who were actually singing, while Nikolai Petrovich whisper a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what the audience still wanted to see in his father's show.
But as it turns out, that's not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation and a real talent performance in the end, and now Agutin's discrediting the show.
"I sympathize with the" Voices "of the Agutin team, they were doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed him how much he loved dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project his father who does not sing but whispers, what can you call a mentor?"
"I like the way Dad sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin for your money, and see how many people come to this concert."
It's a "Voice" show, not a "High Relatives" show.
"On Agutin's side, it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to say on your own show that you should be speaking to your dad, not on a show that's being made for Channel 1 money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a headless dad should give me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a man from Surgut with a great voice and a tembre get knocked off and put Agutin's dad to the end?
And then we all complain that on stage and on screen the same faces for decades!
"Because you can't get through the fist."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
A circle of blat and mumbling.
And the money in the family budget will be worth it!
The art of absurd continues! "

The Canadian military has been allowed to wear beards to promote the spirit.
The Department of Defence of Canada has issued an order that allows members of the armed forces to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions for the care of the beard.

The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the Russian Federation & apos; s expedition to the Moon.
The head of the Institute for Space Research of RAN, a correspondent member of RAN, Anatoly Petruković, told RIA News about a possible programme of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was in the process of developing a course of action.
"A consolidated opinion is not yet available," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space-based radiation sources," added Petruković.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for a primitive organism on the Earth's satellite, as the scientist believes.
It could help to determine how life is on the planet.
The head of Roscosmos previously said that, in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a manned flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.

I couldn't do anything, and it was really painful.
The Russian pilot, "Williams," Sergei Sirotkin, commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I ended up between two cars that hit me right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in the traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of us were on a pit stop, we would get into the clean air, and we would get back to the pace, but there was no more rubber.
Plus he was fighting his partner, he was in contact, too.
I understand he made a little mistake.
We were in this situation on the most untouchable track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore, "" that's what Sirotkin RIA says. "News."

Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's a great thing to pay attention to things like this.
I completely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only makes the team more of a mess.
First of all, these are poems, you can read and take them any way you like.
I wouldn't be responding to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
If the Silks and the Eschchenko are being put on the lacquers, that doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lack the flexibility to understand the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Spartacus has no game today, so this situation didn't have to be inflated at all.
Maybe it was just together to make fun of it.
Spartacus has a lot on different lines, and there's a lack of play since young people were introduced.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism before this match, "I'm sure Tarfood.
The game of the two teams will be held on September 30 and will begin in Moscow at 7: 00.
John Terry, who had previously denied Spartacus, led the Chelsea youth team.
Sirius's teachers discussed environmental technologies with scientists.
The teachers of the Sirius educational centre in Sochi, the participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the national research centre "Kurchatovsky Institute."
The researchers & apos; statement was made within the framework of the programme of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Environmental-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the Education Centre on 29 September.
The lecture was opened by a documentary "Curchatova Codes," during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, a correspondent member of RAN, Mikhail Kowalchuk, presented the global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
A lecture for a scientist is published on the Sirius website.
The puppets have learned that modern technologies need a great deal of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet in a position to develop such volumes.
The Forum & apos; s organizers said that environmental-like technologies that young scientists were working on would help to address the problem.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental-related technologies and also described the risks that inevitably arise in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a great good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of environmental-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a defensive side - a deliberate interference in human life.
There's always a risk.
The car came in, people started to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of the technology at once.
I create a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction, "quote a scientist from the REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of the physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of the NBICS-environmental technologies of the NRC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Diakova, and the head of the Kurchatov complex of the NBICS-technology of Vyacheslav Demin.

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low appearance
The referendum was called upon to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country as "Northern Macedonia."
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonian of the name of their historical province.
The rename gave the former Yugoslav Republic the opening of the road to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as the EFE agency reports, only 34% of the show on Sunday's plebiscite was "not reached" to the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative in nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse to rename.
In his statement shortly after the closure of the polling stations, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, a supporter of the change of name of the Republic, said that if there were more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name despite the unreached quorum.

Kemerovchan resented a herd of barans at the cemetery.
On September 30, the well-known Kemerov page of the social network was reported by an eyewitness that a local cemetery was free to walk bovine animals.
A lot of animals went between the fences and picked up the grass.
The commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help to clear the area from weeds and grass, but some of the people in the city did not have to take a good look at the behaviour of the animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the barons to do.
The baran, of course, will not say they are, but it is not a matter of fact. "(style retained), noted in his message an outrageous Kemerovchan.
In any event, one witness noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would be taken shortly.
It's the right thing to push and catch up.
There's no such thing as a word.
That's right.
The word "give" in the meaning of "burden, influence, influence" is only a phonetic one, because we hear the sound instead of "catch."
We use that word to think it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "catch" ethically not only are not close, but even in some way the opposite is true.
Make sure of it yourself.
Learn (church-book, outdated) means "sufficient, full, enough, enough to be sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
To be free, pleasure is family words.
In the past, he had a meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-fulfilling meaning" - "to catch on."
The old-fashioned "before" is related to "command" and "will."
The pressure, the pressure, the other one.
These words are truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (giving sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidü - "harass."
A similar phonetic image of the words "pressure" and "catch", as well as an imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d" that is used in the letter through "a," which, in good faith, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, that's right, to catch up.
But that word is outdated and is no longer used in its right meaning.
If you want to point out that any circumstances / people have a negative impact on you from the top, use the word "pressure."
You can also use the "pressure" structure, but remember, it's the office.

In Germany, 14,000 people took part in a demonstration against racism
Some 14,000 people took part in a demonstration against racism in the German city of Hamburg.
The action was supported by more than 450 organizations under the slogan "Together against Racism."
The organizers initially reported that some 30,000 demonstrators would take part in the action, who would call on the authorities to refuse to deport migrants from the country and advocate for the right of people to protection and asylum, and would write the newspaper Zeit.
The event also stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea should cease to be an offence.
In addition, the demonstrators demanded the resignation of the Head of the Ministry of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Germany, Horst Zehofer, and the dissolution of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
One of the participants in the Neuroz-Dong event stated that the purpose of the demonstration was to show the unity of society and solidarity in the problem.
Refugees and migrants should not be considered others, and migration itself was the mother of that society.
Many migrant communities and anti-racism organizations had sent an open letter to the Minister requesting resignation.
With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists.
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 have destroyed the Russian Air Space Force.
This was mentioned on the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former chief of the KPS, the head of the committee of the Federation Defence and Security Council, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-impact devices: the air and space forces had and continued to strike exactly the terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
Russian air strikes have hacked into the jihadists' defence - a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government forces, and have transferred Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria has also made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IG, prohibited in Russia) and the "Jebhat-an-Nusru" (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, some 4,000 Russian citizens were fighting on the side of the IH and about 5,000 nationals of post-Soviet countries are being transferred to TASS.
This is only a matter of registered persons, with the exception of those who have not been identified, as Bondarev has stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on far-reaching borders - otherwise it is the evil of "whining us."
Boris Johnson's phones and a number of British ministers have been made public.

In particular, the mobile phone numbers of the Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond, and the ex-head of the British Foreign Ministry, Boris Johnson, were available.
According to the television, a number of politicians received "unpleasant calls."
The technical problem has been resolved, and the application is now safe.
We are studying the reasons for the failure and apologizing for any problems, "said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users were able not only to see confidential data but also to edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Environment and Agriculture, Michael Gowa was replaced by a picture of him in a picture of the media-based Rupert Merdock.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Mualem, accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] Coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Rakhqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was directed, and carried out mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law, "he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists," as the targets of the militants and the Western Coalition in Syria coincided with and implied "chaos, death and destruction in their way."
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost complete and that the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence and that priority in the reconstruction of the country would be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of the Hostile Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two F-15 United States aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor with prohibited phosphorus munitions.
The US has rejected all the allegations.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine is entitled to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The Head of State said so during his visit to the Kharkov region, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of his passports in Zakarpatya.
In protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
As we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine, "Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he, as President, will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the Consul of that country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said," the President noted.
According to FACTS, on 19 September, a video was released on the network that recorded the time when Ukrainian citizens were issued in the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo with Hungarian passports.
They have, however, made an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the Hungarian consul, who appeared on the video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the Office of the Procurator of the Zakarpathian Region had initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the article "State treason."
Putin went to Siberia in secret.
It is known that Vladimir Putin has spent the past two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the Council of CIS States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
The data on the flights of the Russian "Borg No. 1" on the Flowtratrar website show that about 6: 00 p.m. on Tajik time on 28 September, Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and took a course to the north-east.
In the area of Lake Balhash, the transponder of the aircraft was turned off.
The direction of his flight is that the liner could have gone to Hakasia.
According to Baikal 24, the President in Abakan met in person on the night of 29 September, the head of the region, Victor Zimin.
According to informal information, Putin had come to the Republic to spend the weekend, but the website's sources believed that the real reason was "the problem of the second round."
The next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region is to be held in Hakasia.
It was attended by Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the Republic, Victor Zimin ("One Russia").
However, on 21 September, Zimin withdrew.
Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia") is to take part in the forthcoming round, together with Konovalov.
The Hakas media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of head of Hakasia and appoint a new reaper as head of the Republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Hakassia in January this year.
In addition to Tuva, the Republic is one of the President's favorite places of rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been taking place in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people have fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus is now in the view that the military action is nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem to the United Nations: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure because of the achievements made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing its reconstruction work in the terrorist-destroyed areas, bringing them back to normal.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult and have lost their means of livelihood.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to provide funds to that end.
Meanwhile, the US and the European Union countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
The Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to the Dielgeite in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the company's United States unit, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The losses of the concert are estimated at at at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.
Until June of next year, the car manufacturer is required to buy or correct 85 per cent of the vehicles involved in the scandal.
In February, the company management stated that 83 per cent of the vehicles had already been met, so that the programme would be completed early.
Folkswagen is always trying to compensate for the losses and to restore the trust of its clients.
For example, the leadership of the concert has recently been reintroduced, and major restructuring and policy changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen is promising to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets: this was the right of the authorities in February this year.

The Saudi Crown is on the first foreign tour.
The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman Al-Saud, made an official visit to another country for the first time since taking office.
This is reported by the RIA News with reference to the Royal Office.

Mr. Ilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the PSC to the actions of the fascists.
The head of the Synodal Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mr. Ilarion, compared the rename of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It is like that in fascist Germany, a Jewish is targeted at a yellow, sharp star, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it was for that purpose that the draft law was created," said the Mitrovica on the Russian 24 television channel (a quote on "Interfax").
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev therefore hopes to have full control over the CPC and "outlaw it," the priest believes.
"It is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It had previously become known that the deputies were pleased to be working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on the change in the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the rename of the PSC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Governor of the Pochaevsky Fame called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian shrines
The Governor of the Saint-Uspenssk Post-Chaev Valley, Mr. Vladimir, made an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and the Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UTC) is published on Saturday at the site.
At different times in history, our predecessors and their own faith and spirit, Christians had to profess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation, and the information we have and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something, "the Mitrovica said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The vicar also stressed that "your physical presence is likely to be required."
The priest added, "The grandchildren of Lenin, by the spirit, are threatened with death, so we will protect our sanctuary."
Those who care about the fate of the Pochaev Fame, the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world shrine, must be prepared to protect it, are referred to in the appeal.
And the people of Miropolis said, "Do not follow those who lead the believers astray."
The CPC has a canonical status as defined by Tomos on 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it up to a new patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope of Roman Warfolk.
A new style with its consequences is not acceptable to us by the Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, "noted the vicar of the lair.
He recalled that since October 1990, the CPC had been a canonically independent and fully independent administration.

The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was widely mentioned in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrouchev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants have waged a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
The current year was a record year of bloody attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans, "Patrouchev noted.
The suffering of Afghanistan began far from yesterday.
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the terrorist group Al-Qaida (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which had settled in Afghanistan, was declared the main enemy of the United States.
It was not a month before America and NATO allies started a military operation there, "Enduring Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
A multi-thousand American contingent is still on Afghan soil.
And the world's life is even more ghost than it was then.
American troops are being pushed to the fence of dozens of their bases.
They can pay off the fighters for money, just so they don't get hurt.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40 per cent, according to Patrušev.
50 per cent are in the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10 per cent is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they're growing fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-halifate in Central Asia, exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be good for it.
It is also encouraging that, in the 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.

Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist: "Through this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will have a right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy. "
The name of the country is being renamed by the ruling social Democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev.
The opposition is a conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to a journalist, Zvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current Zayev-led socialist government is imposed out of the way to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. "
Fai Dulgeri, Euronwei: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine not only the future of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole. "
