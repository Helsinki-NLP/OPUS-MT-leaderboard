National strategy for resistance to the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders have justified their policy with the need to combat the falsification of elections.
However, at the Brennan Centre, the last myth is considered to be that there are more cases of tampering in the United States than those of death by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have been enacting laws since 2009 that make registration or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained new dimensions since the November 2010 elections, which have given the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 draft laws had been adopted that restricted the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the electorate to present an identity card with a photograph and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the electorate on the day of the expression of will, and remove the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state had required voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The national authorities have made an effort to extend this practice to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to submit identity cards with a photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, United States citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million persons who have reached the required age for voting, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a document in 2012.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people who earn less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identity card with a photograph.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use an identity card with a photograph issued by their educational institution.
The same states, however, allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the permits issued by those clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
It was the first time that such a requirement had been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are United States citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the vote of Latin American people.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, national legislators initiated laws to abolish voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wished to register.
This restriction did not go without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the national legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true for Latin American people.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
In contrast to the white, which, by 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters were pre-voting.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several draft laws were passed by the Democratic Governors.
The most ambiguous laws have been suspended with the intervention of the United States Prosecutor General.
This has made it possible to reduce the negative effects in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph.
However, the new rules that had come into effect would certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics condemn the bias of the laws that have been adopted with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the panel to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the system of American democracy.
Screening of prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes produced erroneous results, false and sometimes false results that lead to useless medical interventions.
Men, who are so reluctant to be treated, have more to doubt.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have found many cases of infection among the groups under investigation, so the data obtained are difficult to interpret and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found different mortality rates for patients who have been screened and those who have not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis is 30-40% higher for those who have not passed the screening.
So I would recommend a test from the age of 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
People of African-American descent are also at high risk.
A key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is found.
Cancer can be both aggressive and intractable.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his or her cancer by offering him or her options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not a risk to life in the long term, but by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive or a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are setting the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend that we take the test.
But it is also important to consult with his doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Utility, Mowember has created a tool to assess all for and against the PSA test.

To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people had been well fed and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer cases could have been prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%," said Andre Ball, the press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85 per cent of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is causing enormous damage to human health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the press secretary, André Ball.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after no smoking, the risk of death from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct intestine, food water, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout the life cycle protects against fat intestine cancer," they are added to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends that consumption of red meat be restricted.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of fat intestinal cancer.
The sausage products should also be avoided.
The concentration of meat by spear, drying or salt may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they are explained in the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at the moment, the results of these studies are not clear.
In the view of the SCC, vitamin E research has produced contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
The impact of vitamin D cancer on development is also not fully clear.
He stressed, however, that it was important to discuss his concerns and family experiences with a doctor.
"It doesn't lead to cancer."
The Higgs Bozon is in detail.
The last summer's report that the scientists might have been able to find the Higgs Bozon has caused real agitation - and not without reason.
It is believed that this bozon explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last part that has been predicted under the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, the "least imperfect," description of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not been found in the past by an experimental way.
But physicists are not yet fully sure that this is the Higgs Bozon.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very much like the Higgs bosons predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
So let's just say that this is about the Higgs Bozon, because the chances of error seem to be minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, stating that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to go around this rule, don't even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But while the physics of the elemental particles is a rather strange world, there is also one law of this nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paulie, which suggests that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" is "state" in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called fermines, who are prudently subordinate to the principle of Paulie.
The other is the bozas, the abominable anarchist gang, who have no respect for anything - at least that principle, which means that they may be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, completely unusual), Particle Adventure Berkeley Labs, these bozones are in turn divided into two groups: the mosons we will not be talking about, and the "pieces of force" that extend to the main forces of nature and to which the Higgs Bozon is of some kind.
These very bozons, it should be emphasized, are not all exotic creatures, as could be thought of.
In fact, if you are able to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banana bozon: a photon, or a "piece of light," which is a "courier" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when a single particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violation" is an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of "force carriers."
A more stable field
The same is true of Higgs' boss, with the only difference that for this bozon to appear, it must be "broken" by another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to be aroused, very and very high energy must be achieved, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only be crushed by a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one that is being used in CERN, the Big Adron Collider, which is a 27-km ring! - to achieve such great energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between Higgs' boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to the fridge itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have a mass, while others (as a photo, by the way) do not.
So, what can all these studies "can bring," is Ms. Plamondon asking?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a difference between the results of the observations and the projections of the SM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be found, because the smallest inconsistency can open the door to "new physics" and shut down some of the Model holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, without any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, no such differences have been found in CERN.
Consequences
It is difficult to predict the value of these studies for the daily life of the average statistical person, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not available.
See, at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser-research pioneer in Bella's laboratories could not have even assumed what revolution would have caused their work.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
Indeed, a dead physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous one was impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
In addition, an application could be found for a tool accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical studies in 1969.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as a "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Big Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive end-of-life issue.
Debates are about to resume, and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
The "debt" was trying to take a closer look.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. also lived alone in his apartment in Montereji.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven years," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor-Gadbois's palliative care shelter in Beley, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom and even eating.
While sitting at a table with a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He bothers, even smiles, talking to strangers who work around him, bringing him drugs, taking him to the bathroom.
A lot of courage before a normal death.
"My greatest wish to be cured from diarrhoea is humiliating," he will admit.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we are taught that a man has to pee standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's shelter.
Regression to the condition of the child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"It depends on the ability of a man to accept a fall," he says.
Since many people who are involved in palliative care believe that important events are also occurring at the very height of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative shelter are all cancer-sick.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides the assistance called "treatment."
Ms. A., 89 years of age, is most afraid of dying "in the mind of suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before I let her put on a respiratory mask.
She is still waiting for her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois shelter, a group of volunteers provide care and nutrition assistance.
This is a palliative care that remains when nothing more can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
That's very little, given that we're all going to die sooner or later.
This is where life continues under the best possible conditions, which is explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the shelter.
Be comfortable with the physical, emotional, or mental.
To the dying, we will agree to give the company's brandy or pepsi carpentry, even if he asks.
We don't make the diabetics control the sugar anymore.
And death is part of day-to-day.
Last night, we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
His son finished this beer in his feet in the morning.
"We're helping close people, just like patients," Natalie Savar, the director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois shelter, no day is like the previous.
With a 93-year-old man who is enjoying his last meeting with his family in the yard, having been placed on his pillows during his toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man is tragically dying, surrounded by parents, wife and two little children, and having tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christian Martel is a concern.
53 per cent of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from the home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is to be provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois shelter and the Palliative Care Society at the home of the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in the Quebec health system that has led many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and helps with suicide.
Since October, he has been circulating a manifesto signed by the palliative-care glows, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, who have shown their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before a transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to make them easier.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic projections.
The hope for the survival of Helen Richard was already minimal when she stopped inexhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was cutting out of treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping fighting, she told me.
But she told me that my days are numbered!
There is no full care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not complying with their request after the palliative care team has made their pain easier.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not entirely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the director of palliative care in the Pallyative Care Society at the home of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedations, where the patient sleeps until the time of his death, either from time to time or at all times.
You can't pretend we don't know about these suffering any more.
Increasingly, those who are not able to alleviate the pain will be able to have access to palliative sedations.
The sick, suffering from pain always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanaized," which means "I want to make it easier."
This report was made possible by a press grant from the Institute for Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
The officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and the Italian mafia daily tell them what they know about the huge "system," which is the thwarting of the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade union figures and the mafia.
"Industry," which was very expensive to the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"I'm curious how this system is falling apart after all the means have been put into the case," is being used as a joke by Jacques Duzeno, a deputy and former head of the Montreal Police. "
It was his 2011 scandal that was the side result of the investigation into official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from the liberals, Jean Shara, had very reluctant to agree.
The Duzlo Report has established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he has stressed that the Ministry of Transport alone would have retained a billion dollars on contracts" if some had kept their instincts from taking a share.
The Charbonno Commission "has already removed two mayors," he adds, hoping that it can "open up the schemes behind individual individuals."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011, has a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the staff of the special unit "Molot," who had forced Montreal's "waste cartel" after 2009, to stop overstatement of contract value.
In recent weeks, a series of searches have been carried out and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotto, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gilles Weyankur, who recently resigned as Mayor of Laval, is the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of multiple bribes when public orders are placed.
In addition, several engineers of the Montreal Channel Service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkuso and Lino Zambian, have been formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb by investigating the "system" for obtaining State contracts.
For several years, Zambia had given 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to a Mafia-related intermediary who, in turn, had transferred money from the Mayor Gerald Trumblé party "United Montreal."
In the 2000's, Zambia made money to the right and to the left, and it allocated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about Euro68,000) to various parties in the province, mostly to the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had been illegally raising funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewage contracts in which the value is overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked irreversibly.
Gilles Sürrenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in 10 years, he received from construction firms gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the value of which he had inflated.
Other road officials admitted that they had received 30-40 per cent of the bills on the paw by means of false supplements.
A co-organizer from the mayor & apos; s party, Martin Dumont, then accused Mr. Trumble of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash with dirty money.
Following those revelations, Mr. Trumblé resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first members in Montreal to be alarmed.
The Mayor of Rivière de Prari County, east of the island, has been against the sale since 2010 of a $5 million municipal site sold to 1.6 million developers in the midst of a building boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that in an investigation that would eventually be initiated, she would "pull a thread to understand the functioning of an ant-throwing system to stop the gangren and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and an observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
It's like we're cleaning up at home.
Regular.
Jacques Duzeno notes, for his part, that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who know about the scheme" but who have not been involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the campaign in Quebec was 70%, he was joking: "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but he says that this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of State contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down; by being bold at the heart of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If that story cast a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, he called on those who laughed to look into their own court...
"PSW is not a FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you made an extraordinary breakthrough at the PSS.
How do you explain that growth?
This may be due to individual consciousness, but may also be a new dimension of the SPA.
The great players are here.
I'll grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff have also done a great deal.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
It's going very fast in football.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the very beginning, at the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfonten until I came to St. Etienne, I have always taken a step forward.
So you benefit from the competition that Carlo Ancelotti has set up...
This summer is not a new one to play very high-level games.
They also know that every training is very important.
It means that a player like me wants to be at the level and to be as high as possible.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my position.
He's being helped by deputies like Claude McElele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti is a tribute to all the technical staff.
Today, he is not equal in the First League and is one of Europe's best coaches.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I went away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the First League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the Champion League: we were effectively qualified as one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to end up first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the match back in one eighth of the finals.
Can PWs become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and establish long-term positions.
It's not today.
The funding has the means to make this project real.
Would it be a big failure to take the title in the First League, like last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want this championship.
We were close to it last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything we could to come to the end first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points would be a champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be all right.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have taken part in the struggle for title, I think we have the power to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the PSS?
It's okay that there's a lot to be expected of us, given how much we have invested and what we have players.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Tri, and we're still being found for what to criticize, of course, it's a little upsetting.
We wonder what people expect from us first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 count.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved at the Champion League that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't been able to go to the same eighth finale in two seasons, but they've spent a lot of money, too!
Given the amount invested, we've been presenting you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who were not high last season, were "awakened" by this new PSW.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
PSW seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimović's move.
Well, what if they say there's a "Zlatanodependence"?
It just means that Ibrahimović is very successful and that he's holding many heads.
He came for this and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Wherever he was playing, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro-2012 with the French team?
It's a disappointment.
I was very keen to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out of there stronger.
I'm able to play good selection games today.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism at Blue's.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and we must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Descham at the head of Blue?
They're good for him.
He's in good position in the selection group for the World Cup.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players, and he's an inspiration to win.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope that Didier Desham will bring Blue to Brazil.
A well-deserved one (1-1), torn out on 16 October in Spain, is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such games in my career.
Pay and sell without bank help - with Bitkin
A complete contrast to the current exchange of money based on centrifuges, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files among the same-level participants.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites receive billboards for donations or as a means of payment.
The bricon course, which reached a maximum of $30 (Euro23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the course is available on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing special than a world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its report on virtual currency published in October, had been interested in the system.
He describes the bricain as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "like the usual currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credit" used to promote video games that are made in the process of playing or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are both bookholders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between the two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction shall be signed electronically, using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bins used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book distributed throughout the network.
A key step is to record a new transaction in the book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers that, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
This is about the hash phase of the file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, a short and unique one.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" all together.
The objective is to find a number that will provide a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes are easy to verify that it is right.
Transaction is thus unorgastically linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for purposes of deception, the user would wish to pay two times (in less than 10 minutes) on the same subject with money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that made up the problem gets 50 bins.
In order to avoid inflation, the award is regularly divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of billboards in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The network's life has already survived its ups and downs.
The Bitcoin service sites were attacked and the bins were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has that shortcut.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shameer and Dorit Ron from the Weitzman Institute in Israel, reviewed the account book and found that almost 80% of the bickons were not on the market.
The "giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," is happy with John Holmkvist, who works at Coinabul, who is the one who converts the billboards into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency manual, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or an uncontrollable payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper.
The holder is better able to control his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is sufficient only to provide an address that can be "photographed and identified" by the phone, and to make sure Pierre Nuaza has already had thousands of users.
There is a general trend to review hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, would, by the way, review the various risks currently considered to be high if the system were to succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French forces have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Suraka).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying on us alone.
We have suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we have seen as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders who are hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are patient, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West is more sensitive.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I have seen from the height of the hills of the infested almond trees thanks to French credit, has taken place in good order.
The convoy of trucks and armoured equipment, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from a period of insurmountable progress between 1994 and 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, and the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of release, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the gloomy of these peasants, where they have surpassed Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
The former Mojahedas, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women under control.
The main elements of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become businesses taking over State land to reconstruct them to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using the vast United States subcontract.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have managed American generosity will leave: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they assessed its benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, and one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the gloomy of the old parties or to corrupt some leaders.
All, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap opera, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command it will be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Soviet commanders are already working to restore provincial friends who are not under central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, according to the Western model, but the United States wanted to make it a central State with a strong presidential power by removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s and even before, had been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is operational, no irrigation system has been repaired.
All is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority has been given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, State control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
It only increased the sense that the Western countries were there only to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Ainak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also essential that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are highly dependent, restore normal relations on a day-by-day basis.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: a girl & apos; s face, for boys, a French language department at the University, a French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of reconciling aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian" service of the Ministry of Defence (Simic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These activities, with the active involvement of local labour, have helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of arable land.
What are we going to do to remember, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to rid them of the uprisings led by foreign groups that farmers want, as they have told me, it is necessary to provide them with a little non-military support that is well controlled and directly addressed.
The heavy birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Mursi's new risk-taking.
While Egypt is more than ever divided on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play a bank.
By surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete its work.
Soon after two years, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, which has weakened institutional stability and has led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
In his opposition's view, the President is persistent in his "autocratic nonsense," continuing "to violate the word" and "to flout the right."
In the camp, its followers believe that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, is an article after article.
It is also a way for the President to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is rampant throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems confident that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in one interview to the American weekly Time.
In particular, the call for an accelerated vote is based on the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Either you vote in favour of my text or I leave myself with extraordinary powers," which are expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, the spare participants, were rapidly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that, in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, had been amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day had arisen around... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee had considered that the hours of the Constituent Assembly had been wrong.
The text on which the vote was still taking place yesterday is 234 articles.
The subject of universal attention, article 2 has ultimately remained the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, had hoped to replace "principles" with "rules," which would allow for their more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their good will and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Licemeria," the liberals who only see it as a piar.
Because they believe that the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of sharia laws.
According to the Egyptian expert, Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, as "decision-making people are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the beginning of theorrhea. "
Many liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next Rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With that Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulemas, but people with university education, some have been studying in the French system "- is satisfied by Alexis Blue, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that "there may be confusion around article 220, as the terms used are taken from a religious language.
This applies in particular to the "fich."
In the future, there may be a question as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced from those under the old regime.
The other point is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget would not be held in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about a text that they considered to be harmful to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy was maintained, and insult was now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles referred to the protection of a woman, but he emphasized Héba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
She said that the only positive development was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to be on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will, in turn, be on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pool of the Earth and the sea of the salt.
The land of the promised world is the strength of the biblical truth, the modern comfort and the primacy of nature.
AIF identified five of the most important reasons why it is necessary to visit Israel.
We will bow down to the holy places.
It is worth a visit to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all those who enter this "dome" will receive God's grace.
And Galileo is the place of the wonders of Jesus: to turn water into wine at the wedding, to walk through water, to calm the storm, and to fill the networks.
And there came Jesus before the disciples, and after the resurrection.
But most of all, the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here follow the path of Scorby or the path of Jesus.
It begins at the fortress of Antonia, the Pretorium, where there was a trial, and on the streets of the Old City brings to the Temple of the Grobe of the LORD on Mount Golgoff, to the place of crucifix, to the Kam of the Pozania, and to the place of the burial of Jesus.
There is also a symbolic Christian Pool of the Earth that symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem is built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree has grown from which they have made a cross for the crucifix of Jesus.
Jerusalem also has the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Cry, left by the temple destroyed by the Romans in the '70s.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave here notes of wishes that are then implemented.
To make a vertical journey
The ruins of Massad's fortress remained from a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great One built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on the back rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
Only those who are involved in alpism are able to reach them.
The rest of this historic summit is being delivered by a lift on a sewer road.
And in the north of the country, there is a famous Hermon ski resort at 1600-2040, where, in the winter months, there was a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus is delivered to him from the bottom of the mountain.
The total length of the ski track is 45 km.
According to the old betrayal, the mountains were said to have lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go to everyone's for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, should be visited.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or the dead sea scrolls found in the caves of the desert of Judah, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is worth a visit to the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition, there is a wide range of impressionists and expansionists, Monet, Pisarro, Renoira, Cesanne, Cisleya, Matissa, Modilani, Shagala, Picasso.
In Akko, it is possible to visit the Al-Bash Museum, which is a number of old Turkish baths with a pattern of visitors and bankers at the time.
In Caisaria, we should go to the unique Rally Museum, where you can see the Dali and Roden sculptures.
There are no guides and no gift shops.
The entry is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Vash in Tel Aviv, is about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children's memorial, was built in memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas cells.
You go into it and you end up in the dark.
The stars are fading.
And they say the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
To get well.
The three main areas of Israel & apos; s resort are on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has basins, waterparks, dolfinals and oceanariums.
It is interesting that the Red Sea is bathing even in the winter months, as the water temperature is not below 21 degrees of heat and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and it's a year-round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world at the lowest point on the planet - 417 metres below ocean level.
The laser water in it is a crucible that can easily keep the water on the ground even if they can't swim at all.
The peisaks are unreal.
They come here to be treated with salt water, rap, and target dirt, and to treat health in dermats, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetes, in order to make the nerves all over.
To touch the mysteries of antiquity
They are kept by an old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the Mediterranean Sea.
It was followed by a famous maritime route, linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
It is here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromed, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists are very much in love with the narrow streets named after the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "sign," Fortune will be benevolent.
It is possible to meet young women from all over Israel and even from other countries at a photo session in Yaffo.
And in Kesaria, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Kesaria was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontiya Pilat.
It is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A tour for notice.
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money for a trip, not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and the only subway line in the country is a six-station line linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funiculer.
All urban transport modes have 6 shekels, which can be carried for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is that the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are out.
And on Sunday morning, the work week starts.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic and food, which combine milk with meat.
It offers a large choice of ovine and beef dishes, coconut milk soup and dessert, a traditional Jewish humus paste, a variety of sausages, milk-nut balloons, palalel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that go "out on their own."
In the evening, you can see them sleeping even on the roof of parked cars.
The Mursliks love human places and don't give up.
The rental of the car, depending on the mark, will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike is going to cost 15 shek a day.
Tickets at the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Language of figures
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
The citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine were most likely to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Earth of the Own, 51 per cent more than in 2010, before the cancellation of the visas on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and the Powerful" will lead to Moscow: migrants are saving money in the language.
While deputies and human rights defenders are arguing, which will give the law on compulsory language testing, there are already fraudsters trading in "lively" certificates in the country.
In Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia, 13 million gastarbaiters come each year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose is to make money to support families left in their home country.
As of 1 December, a law had come into force that required every migrant in the labour force to pass an examination on the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing, welfare and retail.
However, over time, they promise the FMS, the tests will be binding on all visitors.
It would be necessary to give up not only the language but also Russian history and the basis of legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for the purpose of obtaining and for the extension of the work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where the Russian is the State language.
Nor are persons who have completed their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Promotion, realization and protection of human rights
The network of examination posts will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MSU, the PSBU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by members of the State Duma and the FMS.
And the human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had many times asked the press: what would that actually do?
What will change the obligation to learn the language for both the Russians and the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service is responsible for reducing the number of people suffering from "labour slavery."
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, as explained by the head of the Federal Office of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
The problems are encountered by migrants without a profession, education without a language that does not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I'm sure Sebelev, a future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will put him in a terrible, tight barack where he and dozens of his like will be drowning for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In their home country, they are promised one, and upon their arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken, their wages are not paid," is confirmed by the Chief of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Labour of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, you little man!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to work for Russia are recognized, not only do they not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but they are also hard to write on their own.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford even an interpretation of primary education.
Because their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention their proper clothing, shoes and school supplies.
And when you're young, these guys go to work as soon as you can.
It is difficult, if it is not good with the knowledge of the tongue, to admit it.
"You feel humiliated and incompetent."
Indeed, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders have made one important point.
The test will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastarbaiters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the Foreign Entrance is prohibited."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic and still the same language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money, between 12,000 and 16,000 roubles.
But a fake registration can be made fast and only for a thousand and a half.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and there are also cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," a Tajik citizen, Umed Khuskadam, shared with journalists.
"Fill it, don't miss it, buy the painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
A number of "fake" language test certificates have already been removed by FMS.
The fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they were not assigned to new owners: each of the migrants who had hoped to make it easier to pass the tests had paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is more than two times the cost of official testing: it will cost a migrant of three thousand.
The main challenge for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that the "crust" cannot be simply bought, and both the authorities and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise to the Gstarbayers, who have not been able to pass the first test, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian arrivals will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take over the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposes to strengthen the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoot at weddings when no victims were killed, and the massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police officers want to ban the carrying of injuries in public places and raise the age from which weapons can be licensed from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarova, and promised that amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "wiggling."
There is an open letter on the network, the authors of which, representatives of various public small-scale organizations, demand that the "senseless tightening" be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, and the BBC Russian Service has declared the criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 firearms were committed in the six months of 2012, while 1,688,000 were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of civil arms legislation does not allow the criminal to enter the black market.
Now, they say, any weapons can be found at a low price in Moscow.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, described by a retired colonel, Victor Baranc, who has been working for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Gentabe.
Screenshot from a site receiving arms orders
The first is an "army or military trail," that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by Russian officers and by the Caucasian themselves," said the Baran.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from members of the security forces.
The Albanian explains that these include those taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal "guns" are being sold from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, explosions have often occurred.
"There are proven arguments that some of the arson was made specifically to cover the gap," said the former military.
The arms industry, according to Baranza, is contributing.
"There are now private arms plants that are not competitive on the international market and that are throwing weapons from the floor into the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
The number of guns and machine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, is particularly high.
"It has its own production, sometimes artisanal, and there was a mafia that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where did the gun come from?
The experts considered the approximate share of each of the sources of illicit arms in the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Issues Analysis and Public Management Design Centre.
The specialists analysed the records of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminal literature and the open data of the weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, come from the army and the security agencies.
Half of all arms on the black market were "at the expense of officials whose work is related to weapons" is described in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of them are stolen at the stage of weapons production, and 5 per cent are from "black archaeology."
The consulting seller of one of the arms stores, who asked not to give his name, is sure that the weapons found by the black spatter have long been not bought - too old.
Most often, as he says, the new party is being followed by the salesmen to a military warehouse.
Through the launcher, a man buys a unit, like a TT gun.
He's being discharged, handed over through the fence.
"He takes her to town, and here he sells 900 euros for a two-store thing," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so a consultant adds when a crime-detection plan is on fire periodically, and a control purchase is made from illegal arms dealers."
"Like a luxury store."
The seller and buyer are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at the sites, on blogs, until a comrade asked me to come to the race platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the corner where we were going to trade.
The only place I knew the gun was there.
Military observer Victor Baranec
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, a consulting seller tells me.
There are salesmen on the market, but there's also a need to come, on parole, "from Ivan Ivanović, who asked me to tell her she had a tooth."
I'm even getting a couple of castes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He only supplies them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranc tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article on this.
The schemes, he said, had not changed.
He was given an album with photos of "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," it's military.
The buyer, according to Baranza, is not offered a cat in a bag, so you can try everything.
I'm not just buying a potential client. We're going with the salesman to the woods, there's a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon is good, we start trading," the expert describes the procedure.
A shop on the couch.
Internet searches are made available to sites and groups at the Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," it's written in an ad hat on "Buy a combat gun or a machine."
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
And they're gonna sell it to a minor?
"Without a licence of course," asked the user Ivan.
The "buy of T.Moskva" is a concise formulation of the "Fedorinkov" request.
The Federal Security Service has now set up a vast network of front sites and willing to buy weapons of war, a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed and then they take coal to Siberia.
Military observer and former military Victor Baranc
I have heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the limits of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer, through an ATM, pays.
"In response, they send a photograph and instruction where the weapons are hidden," the press secretary of Dmitri Kislov, a public organization entitled "Right to Weapons."
Victor Baranc claims that by leaving an application on the site, you can be left without a weapon and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now set up a vast network of front sites and willing to buy weapons of war, a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they take coal to Siberia," he says.
A $100 Makarov.
In the case of the purchase of illicit small arms, experts estimated that it would be possible to pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Arms, the Makarov gun can be bought for $100 to $300.
It'll take a month and a half.
It is being shipped from the long-term storage warehouses by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to the official stage of the agency, the number of such crimes in the Russian Federation as a whole decreased by 7 per cent, to 22.9 per cent, compared with January-October 2011, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, there are workers in fast food and supermarkets.
The McDonald's is up to a quarter of all American teenagers through work on the McDonald's.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests across America against low wages in Walmart and the restaurants of popular fast-food networks such as McDonald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Food Chicken.
As long as no one is trying to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wallpaper or is meant to be extinct at an early stage.
The activities are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages paid to private workers in Walmart and the rapid-food system, the purpose of the protesters is to establish trade union organizations.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The activities began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday," when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, seized millions of customers and sometimes accompanied by a fight.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work around the world, left their jobs and picket with trade unions and left-wing activists at the corporation's store, whose goods are considered to be modest and medium-sized.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum, eggs and milk.
The products in his stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only ingested at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods at a cost, in part because they pay little to their employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of vehicle loaders or hand scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" called for an increase in the salary and stated that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
The typical Walmart employee, who gets $9.5 an hour, is not in his pocket, they say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost a corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on her salary now.
If Walmart completely shifts the salary growth to the buyer's shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They're gonna spend some $12.39 more in a year than they are now.
Walmart's supporters are quite certain that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporations.
"Black Friday" continued at its stores from 8: 00 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a corporation representative, claimed in an interview to Huffington Post's left site that jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart staff and that the protest was just a "new piara trick" of the union that organized it.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart (they are not complained of in this progressive city, and therefore are not yet here), and by McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he's selling billions of pieces, and after that, he doesn't even give you sick people or pay you for your honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase over time, but not much, and on average their regular workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one makes less of them in this expensive city.
How can there be such money in New York, I can't be sure.
One day, almost a quarter of the American teenagers were going through the McDonald's, who were working after school, while living with their parents.
Few have seen the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly facing an interview with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum that the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protesters, who started at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, that is, more than double their current minimum earnings.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of rapid nutrition.
The American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with perverts and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it is also difficult to reach a trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
Non-consenting
The noisy protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The event culminated in a meeting in the middle of the day with McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, in particular a member of the Glee Council, Jumaine Williams, said, "McDonald's," saying that he's selling billions of pieces, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital, and he doesn't pay you for your honest work! "
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for the post of mayor of the city, Bill De Blasio, who said, "We must join together in support of fast-food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described, it was the largest action of this kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But there were only a few hundred people involved, but not all of them were workers of the fast commons, where tens of thousands of people were employed in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will cause the flames of mass movement.
"As long as you lie to your brain, it's a medium."
A popular theme of modern technology, which has been added to reality, has recently been adopted mainly from the perspective of special points.
At its annual conference in the summer, the current model showed Google, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, it is clear from a discussion with the team leader of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory that for the company's scientists, the points have been reached.
They are masked by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me what your research group is doing.
- We're working on a man-car relationship, but we're trying to spread the boundaries of that interaction.
As long as humanity is in mass, it's stuck with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes with a finger.
We want to look five or 10 years ahead and anticipate a fundamental change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because all are interested in strong governance.
- What else is ahead of us?
Although Kinect has moved to a physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information has improved (more data are received by the system) and is not yet very clear.
We are trying to change that, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including project ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world to make it more tangible.
To do so, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
The popular thing, but are they overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea, but it's a question of privacy, because you don't always want to tell people what you're doing and what you're doing.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not on dishwasher, but on such meagre, short-term.
The gestures were not removed by a camera of the device, but by an outside bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of the outside hours.
But the future is a mixed type of control, like a gesture plus a voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this soda jar?
You say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to find out.
So you want to make users adapt to what a car can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will mostly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will better determine the human response.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution on the depth, it's very important.
- With regard to your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that we can use to work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to have a megapixels 8 at a speed of 1,000 K / s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us - it adds work to the algorithms.
So you have to remember not only the X and Y, but also the Z.
The speed, the number of staff per second, is also very important.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30-K / s are very small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Radmond lab made a touch sensor with a controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how that affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would be very useful in my work with the equivalent of this device, but not requiring a touch to make more staff per second.
- You don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- There are three "cameras" in Kinect, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a signal receiver.
And now the third camera is, in fact, a normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculation required.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogy for Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how that would help in a three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the day-to-day use of the technologies of the completed reality of points, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around, holding a smartphone in your hands is not very convenient, but I think the most cool option would be a "moving" supplemented reality, when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from points to smartphone, a design display, and so on.
The points are a very personal device in which their power (you only see private things), and at the same time the weakness is a complete reality based on points that will prevent you from working on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's say for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by the critics of such an idea: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's answers to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of a tactical feeling.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of a second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a great record of the press!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at making these "images in the air" tangible - for example, the interference of a few directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where your finger is located - makes it feel, but so far it's very weak - like you've been blown on a pillow.
There are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve ends of your fingers, too.
- And you were trying to deceive your brain?
To make him think that he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There is another challenge to be addressed for a long time - how to make a man physically in a very limited space believe that he is going through an open, almost endless one - also working on the concepts of running paths (not like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as the brain is deceiving, the work is still very long.
That's what makes work on a virtual reality so attractive to a researcher -- a lot of things in an entirely predatory state.
A piece of wine instead of culture - Rosbal. ru
Rosbalt is continuing the project "Peterburg avangard," which focuses on the cities ahead in the vanguard of culture and art.
The top list has already been put on top of the Peterburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often being recognized in Europe, without all-Russian knowledge.
The new hero, Rosbalta, is an epathic artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all the red that happens at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at fashion party and back.
The paintings of Cyril Miller always gather a crowd of viewers, wherever they are.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely peterburg social and philosophical scandalers who are the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the late '80s, the beginning of the' 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his presence on the streets, who smiles in the city, raises the mood.
He recently took up a smack and became a peterburg charger, as he was ripe for this complex role by all his bohemic existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you still walk around the city in all red, not yellow or merry, for example?
- I've chosen red as a model for view and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, a imidemaker, and a society.
Although all that is almost grey in society is causing aggression and indecency.
But my provocations are about to start a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the DC Nevsky, where my work was presented.
I realized that was my way.
Then a wave of old free, informal artists went through, and new, free-like me was not clear.
I started to be friends with new-wave artists, with a post-gas-infestation that led to Pushkin-10, and there was no more.
I'm being thrown into the theater, in clothes, in music, in all the genres, except for a word.
And all of this has come together in your art clinic... - I had to go to the center of Peterburg's culture, where all the best creative forces are to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory of Pushkin-10, and there was a music and artistic club, a bohemian club, a house of the Peterburg Bohema.
Many of them were born there: the NUs, the Tequila-Jazz, remember when Schnura was brought with the Van Goga ear project.
Schnur and his friends were singing light songs under the plywood, and they were in a staggering streak, and there was a fashion composer, Igor Vdwin.
When the band played alive, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was the lead in many programmes until the Hali-Galiva time.
We gave them the Trathsberg, and he went his great career, and he got basic education and education from us.
The "D 137" gallery, the "Gribodov" club, is a diversion from the art clinic.
That's where our employees went.
I'm the hero of last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the award was "People of Our City."
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was named, my culmination is over.
In new times, old rules don't work well, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In these years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is the way you know it.
- Many of my paintings are hits, and they are clearly relevant and acute.
I'm going to have a program show, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
The clowns are an extraordinary category.
I used to be social, right now being like that is painful and scary.
But in the clowns, it's all out of the way, it's out of the way.
I love the grotesque, I have some great ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian change of order.
Now they're meeting on their clothes, looking at the outside mechanics, not the inside person.
Maybe you can't give him a hand, and you have to spit in his face.
And the deceit will be taken off by redressing.
And recently, we saw you as a city charger.
To whom, not to me, to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful, too.
- Now, commercial art must be neat, tactile, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
People used to get lost in a pack, bohema loved one, pros the other.
Now everyone's broken into microcommunities, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a $100 paper for everyone to like.
Now we need to think about who you like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov's got a few thousand in it!
- He's got a drop-in, and it's a sex-social field that works.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and in the end, less management, less money, all of it.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to ruin what I've earned.
I was a young man who wrote such paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larion.
I started with the paintings that usually end.
Now, there's a lot of confusion.
They say a culture of spiritual, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a man of the culture of yesterday, growing up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money for painting.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's Peterburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: a cultural official.
But not every one of them can do culture.
With the right kings, it may not have been so, kings, that they were not very understanding of culture, but they were aware that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're moved, because they need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
The tasty girl is thriving now.
The same Eurata, but what they're telling you is that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What is it for you, Peterburg?
- Peterburg is not a cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's soil.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tonic.
We need to make a fashion art, as we did at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented through St. Petersburg grant
To be born in space.
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer.
The caravans of the Earth-based spacecraft are on board to find a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how do we continue in an environment of unawakening or on the same reserve planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be developed at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," is considered by Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute.
But if the conditions on Mars are more life-friendly, then on the surface of Venus it is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Reproduction issues in space have begun to be approached from the flora.
A half a century ago, they were experimenting on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their Earth varieties.
Then, insect orbiting, tiny fruit-fly drozophile.
In 1979, the eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo developed under conditions of unawakening.
We get a completely normal bird on the way out.
And then there's the problem.
"The problem that this bird must find a support, he must stand on his feet and start moving," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Health and Biological Problems (IMBP), RAN Vladimir Sochev.
If I don't find a support, the little girls are out of order.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atropy of instincts.
The birds didn't react to the light and the sound.
And there was a problem with four days later, they just died.
"And two times we've been lurking the girls, and then we've refused because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the failure of an experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sichev.
With animals, the last time a biological minikovcheg was in orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex people will be on the bion.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent to space with the fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was just on the biosphere, but again it is a single experiment, and such research must be carried out," Vladimir Sochev notes.
After landing, space rats had a progeny.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not a simple task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike a beast, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Terekova had the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tea is gone, and no one on Earth could say if it would continue after a flight into space.
If she's having a baby after this flight.
"No one answered that question," said the Vachtang Vachnadze missile and space industry veteran.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight to space, the first woman astronaut, Valentina Tereskova, gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitsky, a second female astronaut, had a son who had been in orbit twice and even worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, we have some cosmonauts who have had enough after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if it is more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," it is the result of an astronaut-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polakov.
Yet humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The KPK Hydro Laboratory is a mandatory stage in the preparation of the flight.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, astronauts are developing skills in open space.
The water is imitation.
If, for adults, the water is comfortable, but still the environment is alien, then for the babies, it's their own.
The little Ihtiandra, it's like they're confirming that life on land is out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby being around nine months in her mom's lid fluid, and he's more comfortable getting used to the water.
In principle, it makes sense, because it only takes two weeks from the time of birth, from the time of that first bathing.
"It's very small to forget something," says Marin Axenv, a sternum navigation instructor.
In a word, if a child is born with a more natural condition, then a woman needs gravity, a force of gravity.
It's very fast to be unsatisfied with the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, the ability to push the fruit down.
All right, let's put that down, too, relying on the birth stimulants.
You can, of course, go to a special cell to give birth, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of Earth's attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
It is not possible for a new-born in orbit, as an adult, to wear a special loading suit for training.
He's just gonna be deprived of what he's gonna need.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to take, by allowing a child to be born in an alien environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled person who is completely defaulted," the head of the committee on bioethics of the IPPC RAN Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthmen on their ships are sent to a distant planet, which will be a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Office of Audit and Monitoring: The review of the system was failed by politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good controls and, despite the existence of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the Aktuálnă.cz. site.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I believe is missing," commented on the current situation of Kal.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of bad practice, the approach of Petra Néchás to the so-called mop system is cited.
The Prime Minister had recently stated that the GAP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - that was prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister may not oppose the work of the institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What was it exactly about?
It means a parallel test that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the fact that European legislation approves how public procurement should take place is further followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even when it is not yet checked, interesting differences have been found - to put it simply, we may have "precise and unmistakable" legislation, but in practice we are, in some respects, subjecting Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project actually help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, to reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But not the fact that we're going to achieve it by reducing our orders.
This system may be filled with "paper" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
And how is the control system functioning in Germany?
Is there an organization like our EOC (Audit and Monitoring Office) or is it working differently?
With regard to institutions, we have Bundesrechnungshof as our EOC, which is organized according to our principle, and there is a panel that works in a slightly different way, but mostly both institutions operate in a similar manner.
In addition, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, that is, an audit unit at the federal land level, their system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier than we do?
In fact, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some ways, Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't be said that it's better at all.
Is it because they're better at control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not benefit from working with our office, would they?
In the case of domestic legislation, how did your establishment be affected by the amendments to the Public Procurement Act, in some way, show the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been shown in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the facts, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future tests - we have started using our new "uneconomical risk-detection" tool, through which we have run almost 14,000 government contracts, and we have analysed them. There, of course, these changes will be shown, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you believe that the approval of this law would be useful or would add to the burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are "tightened" and cannot be followed.
In the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - the regional council) that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be strengthened in such a way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this road is not going anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GAP would not bother entrepreneurs with the tests of the so-called "mop system." What does that mean?
"Swarz-system" prohibited or authorized?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies that were required to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, "We'll change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend that nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules on how and what should be formally implemented, and that is correct; this will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I believe is not enough.
The roads are slippery, but we're mostly on the road.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snow.
Most of them come through, but some of them are more careful.
Karlovar province
This morning, roads were passed in the Karlovar province, but some of them are frozen and snow.
The temperature has fallen from five to ten degrees below zero, but it must be a little warm during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped, but only a small layer lies in the basons.
However, there are about 30 centimetres of snow on the ridges of the Ri Mountains.
The information from the regional road workers revealed that there was a lower visibility due to the fog.
The R6 and the first-class roads in the region are now without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be deliberate and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain tracks, are also available.
But some of their parts still contain the remains of frozen and the areas of the snow.
Particular attention must be given to roads on highways.
Pardubietsk and Kralovogradec
The Czech Highway and Highway Authority, on its Internet pages, reports that some eastern Czech roads are at risk of hunger, and that mountain and highland roads may be affected by snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a holed, which can be formed especially on the highlands of the Pardubitsk province.
The hunger may be near Lanskroon, Usti nad Orliti, Policki, Svitavi or Visoke Mito, especially on second and third-class roads.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34, located at Switawi, are treated with chemicals.
The snow is especially on the roads of Krkonoche and the Orlitz Mountains.
The observed snow layer is on roads on highlands in the areas of Richnov nad Knejnov and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today, a variable cloud without rain.
The temperature usually varies from minus 3 to plus 1 degree Celsius, light wind.
Plsen province
The roads in Plsen province are passing this morning, but the places need to be careful and adapted to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature is three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, some places may be slippery.
Drivers may face a fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 is now almost free, but the road managers recommend that care be taken between 80 and 131 km.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the south of Plzny and Tahov, there may be deliberate areas.
The second and third-class roads are wet, and a warning is also in place for the possibility of slippery sections.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-use roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouskaya province
Drivers on the highlands of the Olomous province must now take account of the snow on the road.
It was left after the use of chemicals in the Chervengorsk saddle and on the road to the Vesla Krshizh.
At night, a snowfall forced road workers to enter the street, according to information from the road control, about three centimetres of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other parts of the road, there are generally no restrictions.
"There are snow residue on the Shumperk's highlands.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik must bear in mind the presence of a snow cache in the Chervengorsk saddle, "the CHAN (Czech News Agency) today told the traffic manager of the Shumperk road management.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenik also went to the road clearance, and they believed that the roads on the highlands after the chemicals had been treated were still naked and wet.
There are no restrictions on the road in Olomoce, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful on forest areas where humidity is still present.
Ustetsk province, Libeksky province
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are some difficult places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to a number of places with hunger or snow, a mountain road on the site from Telnica on the Clinic in Ustetsk province has been closed.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there is snow and ice on the roads, and in the low, especially south-east of the Czech Middle East, there is no problem, but the road is mostly dry.
No road complications have yet been reported.
Road workers report a hunger in the vicinity of Steti.
According to the meteorologists, the perfect conditions for his formation were created at night: all day it was raining and the snow was melting, the sky was clear at night, and frost began.
Harmful conditions are reported on the main highway and on track I / 13 on the border of Ustecki and Libekki province.
As a result of the snow-torn branches of the trees on the road itself, they were forced to close the road to Telnica on the Book.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to build positive energy.
What do you think is that in less than a month the world should end?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people are getting on so easily.
Together with the Tap Tap group, we are constantly making jokes about this issue and saying that we are the only group in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In fact, in December, you're going to give completely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which was announced at 11: 10 on December 21.
The day before that, on December 20, at 9: 00 p.m., three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrav will be launched in parallel.
They will end, in a very small way, at a time when the May calendar will be completed on Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours early than we have.
Who thought that idea was?
Originally, it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist, Gonza Augusta.
In addition to having enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world that we will once give to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed a anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World is canceled."
Do you think there's going to be a YouTube anthem at these benefic concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it works out and the world doesn't end.
He's being played by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be heard on the live television of Czech television.
The words to this song have written and played the role of Jesus in Thomas Ganak's video, also in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We are also cooperating with other persons in Czech cultural life, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We are actively engaging them in these projects.
It turns out a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the result of a concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STADEO barrier-free education centre, for the sixth year we've been working so hard with the civil association Tap at the Jedlica Institute.
Teachers regularly attend school students at the Jedlica Institute and conduct fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to their teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity in this way.
As part of the project for the further construction of the Jedlica Institute, a separate building will be established in the future to which we will move with the project.
Each concert will be attended by several music groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to develop a programme that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barth, The Tap Tap, Mariang Bango and Ji Suhi will play.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "great events" in the future?
In May, we will be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and we will, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for the border, and you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchair, their chairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolbox.
However, as we were dealing with this without any problem, the Czech airlines ČSA and British British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, which I've been surprised at many times.
Even in Moscow, where we just came from, it went well.
Through travel abroad, you can compare countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you been facing so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that the East is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and there is still an independent movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
And there's no such thing as to give way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we have to keep up with the front-line countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to make it clear that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own on the streets, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, or anywhere...
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, and that's what we're doing with The Tap Tap a little bit ahead of them!
Respect for the public or the lack of barriers is one thing, but at a time when there are famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us, then everything will really change.
So far, these single cases are people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but will return two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Jedlica Institute as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician, and I'm also on a saxophone, I have an interesting music club with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our lead Ljaya Angelovich says, it's a little out of control.
It's only been popular in recent years, or am I confused?
It's true, it helped us to join the famous singers and work actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is, in fact, as if it did not exist.
With the assistance of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal so good to turn The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in Shaw business that are imitating one another.
It's logical, everything new is being taken with caution, and it's going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned individuals we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not just for them, but for society as a whole.
Has it been successful that you are a strong leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do the work qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to practice twice a week, go to preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
At present, 20 people are part of The Tap Tap.
How many were at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of will, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012, at 1 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, Brno at the Fléda Club and Ostrava in the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a television bridge at the time of the "End of the World" song by The Tap Tap.
The purpose of the project is to raise funds of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multi-function barrier-free equipment for the STUDO educational centre at the Jedlica Institute in Prague.
The ticket for the concert is 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of age, free of charge. The tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the years to come.
But the road to space in Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts had been on a flight to space, but that was not always an understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who, on 6 December 1933, presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his innovative work "Introduction to Space."
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after a few years Schernfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadovsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Eno-Peltri and André Luis Hirsch Award for "Introduction to Space."
Dr. Jan Gadovsky (1899-1966), referred to above, later became a great astronomy and space activist.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadolsky became a well-known global cosmoist, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a road-driven railway was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the draft.
It is not even clear that a missile was to be used to disperse or to stop the trolley.
The information about this dress is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has been thinking about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with the Professor Metzilov Wolfke and Gustav Mojitsky.
The remaining material shows that the studies have reached the practical test stage.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter missile, proposed by the engineer Rogozinski, was introduced in the specialized press, and next year the work of the Leliva-Kobiblotsky Air and Aircraft Bomb was launched.
Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war itself, all military missile projects were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on space was introduced in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of "Problems," which contains four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed to organize a society that would engage in space.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already on the line, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PEA) has been trying to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and has become a real member of the International Federation of Astronautics (established in the autumn).
And next year, the first President of the PEA, Kasimej Zarankevich (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that position until his very death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, PCA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, capable of reaching a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of RM-1A was subsequently built and two-stage RM-2 was tested in the summer of 1959 in the Bledov Desert.
The missile was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 square metres.
The next version of the missile was already able to carry out real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have reached 14.5 km, and its mission was to monitor the high-wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM-type missile was followed by a Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which were different in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile had an area of 0.4 L, Meteor-1B 0.34 L and Meteor-1C 0.62 L.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, a Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2, with a start-up weight of 380 kg, was able to bring a useful 10 kg load to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland & apos; s accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Interspace programme, Poland had participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Gershevsky had become the second interastronaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The decision gave rise to a lively discussion in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at that issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted private capital flows, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The significant difference in labour costs (wages) creates price tension.
This concept should be understood as a condition in which a producer, by delivering a cheap product, is trying to compete in economic competition for what "misses" the value of a competitor in order to take most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means that for most entrepreneurs, either the transfer of production abroad or cheap procurement abroad or disappearance, the result being that unemployment is increasing in countries where labour costs are high compared to others.
As private capital has no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable social spending of the State is increasing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the social economic and social damage they have caused in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The unscrupulous methods of private capital create a situation at the level of individual economies where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments are putting their own people on the margins of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected first and foremost in the changes in existing legislation.
The aim is to force its people economically to abide by the decree of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a tool to reduce workers & apos; rights under labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing, but also the difference between the poor and the rich.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there has been a public distribution of food to poor people who have not been able to feed themselves through their own labour for several years.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the strengthening of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases in which employed persons receive such wages that the State should pay them to have a living minimum.
Such a scandal was also known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all the southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as in the 19th century, or to live on a poor wage at the back of society in the hope that private investment capital will ever come into the country.
But is he asking where he's coming from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for a share of European wages.
This is the case for all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say to the point that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital has insisted that the State should not be a manager of the economy.
The question should then be asked whether private capital, now practically the policy manager and the whole State, was acting for their own selfish purposes.
The only answer is yes.
The existence of almost all-powerful and besieging lobbies in all States is evidence.
As a result, we have a desperate situation of corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where almost all deserve punishment, but not as a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is that government ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, are responsible for drafting legislation to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
These bills are then approved by Bundestag.
The whole of power comes not from the people, as the Western-type constitution states, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that a liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly being found in a situation as described by Appian in the "crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The State has long been disintegrated and the agencies are engaged in violence.
The bribes, the illegal use of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption have not been allowed to flourish, and people have been going to elections with a pre-sold voice "..." decent people have not run for the office of ruler at all, after all, one day the State has been left without a consul for eight months... "..." Serious has begun to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is self-restraint and the need to choose a strong man... "Appian thought that it would be Pompei, but it was Caesar, who has finally changed democracy into self-power.
As in ancient times, today & apos; s society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is not, in fact, used for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: an unprecedented decline in the elite without any effort to reform in greater depth.
So the reason for fascist and communist regimes is to seek in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State & apos; s share of the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"It's not going to come out of violence, and it's never going to come out" - Sting, the song "The Pigs," where the main verse of the refren is "we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be" - the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, given rise to many responses.
Some are in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that it is the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of the terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who, in this recurrent wave of killings, is a criminal and who, after all, is the victim of today & apos; s citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and have not witnessed the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to look at who has been the most affected by the 95-year-old tension (from the signing of the Balfur Declaration in November 1917) on a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred for a single generation.
There is one among the astronomical rich families that could be seen as the head of a spring (I don't know if anyone is above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
They don't write a lot about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they had bought in the 1900s to stop rumours linking their name to the criminal activities in the higher fields in which they were in the shadow and which had always led to the strengthening of their power, wealth or both.
They have large stock packages in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in which they do not have a share, they are conducting or preparing war (there were only 7 countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, 5 countries after the invasion of Iraq, only 4 countries were left after the overthrow of Qadhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of a central bank for the Rothschildov Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own (understand government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the federal reserve system), was killed in 1963, and was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the launch of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great Mason of the 33rd level by Albert Pike.
The purpose of the first war was to destroy the monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion (such a number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and to finally take over absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by Rothschilds, work is to challenge the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis they had caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to launch the First World War by killing the Gabsburgh heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the king's Russia, beginning a Bolshevist revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, military and economic surrender of Germany (no longer required war to destroy the king's Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was divided.
In order to facilitate the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, placing on Germany enormous military reparations, which created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then left only for the Germans to be given a strong enough, incriminating and simple solutions by the Chief, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and indeed played the role of a fifth column, in the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the field of historical Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfur Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have taken place on both sides.
The Second World War has been launched, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler was out of the chains in which he was initially held by the bankers, or what he did, was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was declared to create a third war.
If the international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of the fighting on the front line, now with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is the victim and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the resentment is an affront to an endless chain of violence, if all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish Israel's ordinary people from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are helping people to vote on their own elections.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascist, loyal international bankers, a politician who is doing everything possible to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will also threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world's economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994 now: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born body is implanted at birth by a chip with which it becomes an entity under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a brand on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked with the name of that beast or the number of his name can neither buy nor sell.
That's what wisdom is about: anyone who has a mind can figure out the number of animals.
For it is a human name, and that number is six hundred sixty-six.
The "Operation" film: When it's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators took the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah of Mohammed Reza Peljevi, who had fled after the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, there was no positive outcome - it could not afford to throw a shah overboard, because it could have fundamentally undermined the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not in a position to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theoretical regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released 444 days after the talks facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The attack in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, mediated by actor Ben Afflek, "Operation" Argo, describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America a little victory.
Shortly before the Embassy & apos; s occupation, six workers were able to escape.
After the difficult perpetations, they completed their journey at the Canadian Embassy's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, has been able to remove them from Iran, and has been helped by an extravagant cover legend, according to which they have travelled on Canadian passports as members of the survey team, who have found a place in the country for the production of science-fiction epiphany.
A combination of genres
The plan that Tony Méndez's "evacuation expert" invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend true, the specialized magazines write about the draft film, hold press conferences, and a fictional production company has a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
The Afflek film is a special combination of a few genres.
On the one hand, the real political teller, the so-called "movie-down," the story of a good idea, the scam, can be an example of a series of films about Ooshen's friends.
The film is constantly changing the mood - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (the numbers show familiar historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no great differences in this).
On the other hand, facilitated Hollywood pieces, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in the suits discuss the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the institutional stairs, on the phone...
Ben Afflek had a great career relaunch.
From a laughing actor, he became a respected director, and his game was no longer a subject of ridicule.
"Operation" "Argo" his third full-scale film, after a dark detective, "Good-bye, baby, good-bye" (2007), and a triller, "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Afflek that is not made in the home city of the director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is, however, one of the qualities that raised the earlier film of the director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck's doing it at Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, and when real events are rebuilt, the opening scenes of the Embassy's fall are impressed by its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when history is suddenly changing.
The same effect is achieved by Afflek and his colleagues in the scenarios of fictional (false headquarters at the Tegeran bazar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply many exciting scenes of cinematographic importance.
He's quite successful in working with a few of these, sometimes he's thinking of something - it's not so elegant there (a scene where a phone call in America is preventing an impending crisis at Tehran's airport, and a runway chase is a pretty good idea).
The lack of "Argo" is the dissipation associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
The Afflek film lacks a little drama, a film that can be seen with moderate interest, assessing the production and retro-style that reproduces the '70s trillers.
But it's hard to take it.
This is, however, sufficient to remind one, still in a known sense of life history, and to demonstrate how the perception of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services is exaggerated.
Air-ball, banana and circus rules
The portal www.bankovniipoplatky.com, which is conducting an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop."
"We were encouraged by this last event, in which the EU is planning to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said "The Right" by Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women is among the aberrations already submitted for nomination.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be presented by people before the end of this year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which, as a result, is harmful to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury-grade devices only because they contain a relatively small number of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the cell for chickens, which has resulted in significant egg damage this year.
The de facto prohibition of the use of the term "brown oil" or the removal of classic lamps was also criticized.
The quality bananas shall be 14 centimetres long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, the positions of which in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (thus the Czech Republic is now, even under threat, defending the claims of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are such: for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union were to reach a length of 14 cm and were not able to show "abnormal curvature."
In doing so, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonizes existing fragmented national rules that have complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has still reduced standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives would lead to a waste of products.
A candidate for the polls may also be last year & apos; s EU Regulation, which requires that the air balloons sold should be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult care.
The EU has referred to American studies that suggest that balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children by suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children up to 14 years of age, who are prohibited from blowing into fairs.
Funny ideas are born at home too.
It is also absurd to have a European official rule: anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say "BUPM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the Lissez Faire, has proposed for a vote, in addition to a few of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on the level of food stocks in the territory of a member State.
The EU has established a maximum amount of food stocks that may be available on the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic had since exceeded, for example, the established amount of conserved mushrooms, for which it had been threatened with a large fine.
The survey was also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting grants for a grant application.
But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
To request compensation from the European Union, "the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas, said in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he stated that the country had a high grain harvest and that, as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the State had complete stocks that had to be removed.
For being far from the ports, the EU, according to the House, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met with the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Paul Nemtz (US-DEU), has offered grants to the villages, in particular for the preparation of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Exciting orders are the exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as more effective functioning and development of the European Union, are more likely to be recognized by many experts.
In the view of the experts, a major problem is the drawing up of EU grants for projects that do not even have an indication of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, as in other countries of the European Union, must fight in Brussels for the right to the specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Checks, after six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrian, retained the name "Olomous cheese," but the "Tuzemsky rum," whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Tuzemac."
Only products from cane distillate, not from sugar beet, can be called rum.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-known "feta" and "horgondzola" cheese, a German-owned Marquis of Lubek or a Parma ham, has already found, for example, a carloavarian suhari, a mustard and a tri-chebong carp and a yatetsk hmel.
The EU's trademark may also be proud of the pardubic buckle and the horsemen.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think to run for president?
I don't think about being a senator or a president.
If everything was working in our country without a problem, I wouldn't run.
But I can't watch the country turn around in the last 20 years, the thieves are fading, people are raised by taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent man who is not a party, I have no other way to influence things but to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but you went to the presidential castle soon.
So do you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I have always said that I will be involved in the struggle for the presidential castle, depending on the results of the Senate elections.
I later made it clear that if I was elected Senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can exercise my views.
So I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, are going to be in a bar or a TV, but we are ready to waste anyone who's trying to change something.
In addition to this, the media, which portray the human being, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie, are also being added.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's go to your eyes.
The battle for the presidential castle has begun with a discussion of political responsibility and criminal responsibility and the return of property statements of over 20 million.
In order to do so, the law must be changed.
You have no such power as President, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbied, as a citizen, for a tour to become a free business, it was promoted.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or the right, they deliberately obstruct them, and this is a deterrent to citizens.
As an independent, non-party person, I have much more potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without a party's stripes, without a look at the dogmas, and apply it.
Do you think you're more of a right or a left?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left-hand person.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone who's right, but someone's left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether or not the HPMP or the GAP will offer it, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove it by what you say?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are being addressed by prominent experts.
But without parliamentary support, you will have only slogans.
And you won't be in politics for long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to exercise criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public, and to try to take them to our side so that we can achieve our own.
If I had been elected President, it would not be a problem to have a live television broadcast in which I would call on the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell me why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who would express abuse, it would be possible to put pressure on the political stage.
Take the direct election of the President - it was a good thing to be pressured by the public.
I'm telling you, I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up to my beliefs and views.
I'm just starting up in politics, and for my program, I'm gonna try to get the support of a majority.
I'm trying to move things on on my own; if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save Chechnya.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything alone, so I've outdone a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radio Yangchur, he refused because of a lot of work.
I also supported, at least, the lead investigation of journalist Jan Lorentsov, who discovered fraud with light fuel products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I'm on a scale.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and most of those who had chosen the representatives of the hysteria.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be difficult to make.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, such as direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the integrity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for a presidential campaign, only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague of about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, an art collection of about 10 million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and Superb School of a million, and a few million more.
By the way, Aston-Martin came to me because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against indecency and lawlessness.
You go to Aston Martin, you own $60 million in property and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs will actually cover my senatorial salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
For example, the director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would have wanted me to be a naughty man who would keep the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which is what I get.
And if I were to be president, I would have finished my business.
You'll find a full interview in the Saturday issue of Law.
The MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - in the case of Spacenissa and its recently built Book Mountain - two photos.
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
No one's going to such old-fashioned libraries on their own right now, right?
Spacenisse, a small sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are shown on the euro banks, in the form of a painting of painted miniature from the iron concrete.
The success of this education initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only chance to win the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas from the Rothterdam architectural office MVRDV, a wizard of bold columns and an author of smart, sometimes even cynical structures, took a job with his usual unresresemblance and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.
And while the jury's members were looking around and shaking their shoulders, the cunning Maas put out of his original gift a pyramid in size and concluded his speech in defence of his draft with the following words: "Dear urban people!"
This is my proposal, "Book Mountain" in Spackenis, so-called Bucenberg!
After nine years, the mountain had grown at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of the audit project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and a number of adjacent housing and township units for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the Dutch National Wood Contest 2012.
Thus, an insensitive suburbs that had previously been unable to offer anything but a post-modernist pedestrian zone and a surprisingly unbeautiful town whose white facades suggested a dairy plant had become richer for one modern architecture.
But most importantly, the first public building for cultural purposes in the history of this town has emerged in Spacenis.
Long road to the book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of the mountain, because the real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The space on all sides is light and easily visible, the fields of the burned brick and the elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban area.
The urban environment is being rebuilt perfectly.
The look is unwittingly looking for scumbags, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere are books, books, books.
"The bookshelves are usually along the facades, and there is a big dark hall in the middle, usually unpleasant and indifferent," said Vini Maas.
We put a classic configuration of the space from the feet to the head, and we pulled the area from the inside out.
The inside of the book mountain has been well used: the centre has offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and technical facilities.
The black bookshelves, which serve as a separation of the walls, the parapettes, and the stairwell, are particularly happy.
Their species, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in the guesses of what the unknown material is.
"We wanted to work with secondary materials," Yop Trazolist, the project manager representing the community of Spacenissa, explains the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years now, the heat and fields in the Netherlands have used a millimeter-thick artificial fibrous material as a stowage.
It's cheap and it's time-saving.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, and then you can throw it away.
For the library, this stripe, for the first time in such a volume, was printed in a panel of four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplic (KLP) is becoming a dark, homogeneous, solid material that smells a little like a new car and a little bit of a sneaker.
They take 105 steps to the top.
Those who travel almost 500 metres will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood chips in the pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," Trotsworth says.
The heat of the ground shall be used for its heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under the glass cap, even in clear days, the sun only gets inside for a little while.
Large-scale adhesive wood farms, located perpendicular to the glass facade, have a shadow and take on most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic steering curtains.
Stefan Spermon, an IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spykenissa, who was long missing."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his own meeting.
The books were supposed to be empty on the shelves of a library that was not yet fully staffed, with 70,000 books at that time.
The idea worked.
The fields are made to be a trust.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident is in some way connected to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves to decorate.
The MVRDV has thus been able to meet a royal task, which is called the creation of identity in a professional jargon.
Spacenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for an identity.
"The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, a US-Europe liaison expert doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
At the time of the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO implemented this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from the policy that the US, so to say, was running, to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent and unified policy for Europeans.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that, for the time being, they have only found their role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy pursued by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that is independent of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany & apos; s economic interests are very different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to insult the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Has Germany hurt its relations with the US by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the US, there is a greater understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
It is a signal that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the contrary, has clearly expressed its support for the veto.
Is there a divergence of views between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government, in its heart, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But, given the local political situation, the Government of course cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that the significant differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you look into the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not very happy about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of an essential partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a little easier if there was a single, consistent European policy, but it is not now.
They could not therefore take a broader approach and were instead forced to act on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do from the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have a more independent role to play.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not take on a really primary role?
Or is it still hard for Germany to take the lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, there is a wide range of anti-German feelings.
The Germans are not just dealing with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point in time the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who's left?
The Germans will just have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it's making you feel bad, it's life.

"Trade trademark security" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Laren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a fully officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names bring a claim.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violations of trademark rights in the Far East.
I have a new case of this kind on my desk every week.
It is sufficient for simulators to add only a few letters to allow them to register their trademarks.
So, from Gucci, it is produced by Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
The same is true for German enterprises, such as Puma, a producer of sports goods.
Putloh opens a file with the records of the trademark registration office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chinese are world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey unverms that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, the Putloh cases were not the case, and on instructions from his trustees, he was opposed to Chinese enterprises being officially given the right from the trademark registration office to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai," a passenger stamp.
This word is associated with the "baan dakuan."
That's what they call women after rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not plead guilty.
"This is detrimental to business, it must be fought," Putloh is convinced.
"The brand is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image is suffering very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with its sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult and expensive to remove doubtful entries in the trademark register.
The process can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Putloh is talking about cases where the court has rejected the claims, since after a long period of time the contested name has become the "reality of the market."
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will even have to pay the plagiator because he damaged his trademark in China, says Putloh.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with Sany's construction machine manufacturer, an enterprise that had recently acquired a concrete Putzmeister pump firm.
So the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo Gely originally used a blue-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of the luxury products Lacoste lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO trademark registration office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a "return from an emergency in the working process to a normal."
For example, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the agency.
It's expensive to fight it.
As very often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, reporting to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,380 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to challenge, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concert has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
The Germans have been able to ensure that their illegal production of forged vehicle parts has been eliminated.
The simulator, however, has taken over Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was its own omission because the names in Germany are not protected, said by Hanno Ventzler, Chairman of the Board of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration agency rejected the Munhens' claim.
Indeed, both of the next Freudenberg institutions have won, but the other side is still fighting.
We need to be on alert.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes away a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic costs are unlikely to be accounted for, and the company's archives have had to look even at acts of a hundred years ago in order to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered a "large six-digit sum in euros" to the other side for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how expensive it is," Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to move even into Europe.
It is if the simulators register unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concern had long stopped production in those areas, but had been able to prevent registration.
"To be alert," Ventzler says.
Both he and Patloh's lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; rather, foreigners should "all that is worth protecting, also register in China," said Ventzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in his last trade-sign drama, then he will have to pay the wrong party his own name licence fees, and Ventzler explains it.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Infestation, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Ibongi choir is rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy.
The history of a relationship that has reached a distance of more than 8,733 kilometres.
At first, it is made available: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and men's shoes pick up a stroke on the parking floor and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - are slowly increasing - they come, they are charming and they follow each other.
And Fit Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, is almost out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and express gestures.
The evening of Monday, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a human genetics specialist to a palace, attended the rehearsal.
Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, and every voice of the choir has its own text, and it is also in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help assistance
The United Nations AIDS Programme estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
However, more than 40 per cent of the population is positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzeni, Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school, preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the whisper.
It guarantees the child the money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Centre.
Imbongs in Zulu means a storyteller or a pageant.
In this room, they don't say "run" to a bantu, but they can sing.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been learning songs in this other man's soft language, and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to southern Africa.
In fact, there is a village in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland that is 8,733 kilometres of summer from Heidelberg, which is dependent on the voice of the German choir.
Insured 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw hut, and many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the HDI virus.
In Esiteni, the miniature reflects the disease of Swaziland as a whole: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The cutting of the extreme flesh in men, which is proving to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland had an immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth ten was not uncommon.
The Glee Club opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but earlier, the participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but also just food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, there is no chance of a person in a poor country.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants - a few euros a year to send a child to school and allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa," which has since been almost professional in the care of AIDS orphans in Esiteni.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs are syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are frequent viral STIs.
The lobe pediculesis and garlic are related to parasitic STIs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute is of the view that in at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer is due to sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, often sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidosis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are among this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papilloma virus among our young people.
How is the number of infections changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Coh Institute, has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases may result in genital mutilation, complaints during urea, separation, lower abdomen pain, and bubbles or sealing.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you defend yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In fact, part of the cause of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend regular testing, especially in the case of frequent change of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, most STIs can be treated and remote effects avoided.
It is possible to collect a few things to make a move, to make a donation, and not least to pay for the choir's performance all over Germany.
"We've sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is administered by Zodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that orphans are well-equipped, such as one of the grandparents.
Gogos, as they call it in the Zulu of old women, is the back of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, provided them with a roof over their heads, and ensured that children in uniform will be present at school on time every day.
Those who have no family left are admitted to the Hanysir shelter, a single woman who is paid by the association, as are two cooks who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two hens and, together with the United States health organization, PSI organized a HIV test for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, is very much a matter of silence.
The King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
It is rather unusual for a country where the King has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, it is also the State-mandated way of life that is responsible for the fact that the HDI virus has spread so rapidly in past years.
But it also lies on the vagrants who are spreading the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
The other culture is flesh to flesh. "
In order to support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmotini choir travels every two to three years to southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, morale, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black - a recognition that not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in front of the harsh border guards.
The trip also takes place in Esitgeni, where singers visit the underpants.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on the map, it is more than known in the Etsulveni Valley.
"Go to Esitzeni, there's light," the people here say.
And after a 8733-mile flight back to Heidelberg, when the popping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on fire here as well.
Messenger: NASA opens the ice on Mercury.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
NASA's space agency has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in a special magazine on Science.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that the world's ever-present region is covered in ice.
Its thickness shall be at least 30 centimetres, and possibly even up to 20 metres.
It is assumed that the water comes from comets or possibly an asteroid that has been confronted with Mercury.
No one links the opening of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have been found elsewhere in the solar system.
It is not visible to the people of the Earth that the probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, are investigating the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: little chains to infinity.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as a dwarf planet of Cerer.
Like Pluto, who turns around the sun for Neptune, Cerer, by the new definition of an international astronomical union of 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the "Spitzer" infrared is a family portrait of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborns" in the star circle.
This region of star education - scientists are not romantically called the W5 - is opened by the "Spitzer" telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This perverted heat of a dying star took a picture of NASA's "Spitzer" telescope.
A ring like a donut is made up of material that the star threw out in the process of dying.
In the giant nebula of the Trifid, which has been removed for 5,400 light years from the Earth, new stars are emerging from gas and dust.
NASA's "Spitzer" telescope took this picture of the galactic maternity room.
The starboard of the Plyada, also called "Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with an naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, the color is better.
As a red eye blinking the observer's nebula, the Ulyte on this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Vauvelius.
The similarity with the Earth's continent has brought this nebula to the name "North America."
The combination of a normal and infrared picture provides an express colour transmission.
This new star, in all beauty, was only photographed with the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How they came up is one of the great riddles of astronomy.
It may be the fragments of the moon of Saturn, which was unbearable 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the Watergate galaxy
Depending on the color transfer, the images of the spiral galaxies are turned into real art.
A picture published by the European South Observatory shows a few thousand light years away from Trifid's nebula in the constellation of the Arrow.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-day, three-separate), as the dark bands of dust are divided into three parts of the rocked heart of the star's cradle.
In the constellation of the Zmeenosz, the astronomers photographed the foreman of the space collision: 400 million light years from the Earth, the core of the two merging galaxies is facing each other and will inevitably be encountered.
This is the birth of the star of the Hubble telescope, which was released in the spiral galaxy M83.
One who doesn't like technical cuts can call it "South Cement Wheel."
A picture of the Hubble space telescope shows a fragment of Iris's nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The fog, which has been removed by 1,400 light years, consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the normal domestic dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, photographed the Hubble space telescope for NASA.
The great spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle is always creating new stars.
It's a star cloud, connected to the nebula of Rosetka, also constantly creating new stars, at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
There's no dust in this glowing galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it was created shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei, even before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the space available to them is growing deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, there is a "Big Binocular Telescope."
It allows us to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The "Telecospio Canarias" has a giant internal device, with a diameter of 10.4 metres per mirror.
South Africa's "Big South African Telescope" was segmented to reduce cost.
However, it is about 11 metres in diameter.
The lack of low-cost design: the telescope is firmly fixed at a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality is high light-gathering capacity.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the "search for out-of-Earth mind" (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his or her computational power.
The species at the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
This is a very big telescope, fully in line with its name.
His four mirrors make it possible to illuminate even the average infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
The installation of a European "very large telescope" is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror shall be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements in a total of 42 metres.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were considered the world's largest.
They have two mirrors of 10 metres diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is also looking into the sky with the help of the subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a 30-metre-diameter mirror, should appear on Mauna Kea.
This is where they can see the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space supply the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Keppler has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,335 candidate plans had been found since the start of the mission.
The last preparations for the Keppler space telescope were recorded in the picture.
The James Webb (JWST) space telescope will not be sent into space until 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is that it must be in the light of the first stars and galaxies to look for a big explosion.
Scientists suggest that there's ice on the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger is moving closer to the world's northern pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that Mercury has ice on it.
With the launch in 2004 of the Messenger, the first to rotate around Mercury, scientists are now sure of that.
Drink oil every day and live until you're 168.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are of the highest age in the Bible.
There's even a long-term museum.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-old are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are of the highest age in the Bible.
There's even a long-term museum.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-old are still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains is called a wild and romantic one.
A grinding minibus is dripping on an armored road, passing the fenced forests of hills, brown rivers and simple peasant homes.
Everything is so green and bright that you can think of yourself in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
This is where the Talyshes live - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, of which there is little knowledge, except what they speak well in Farsi and in the Azerbaishan and long-term.
The end point is Lerick.
A small town is frowning with a very difficult architecture of Soviet times, which is not in harmony with a beautiful mountain landscape.
The European tourists are hardly here, and the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours, because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the province.
However, Pilata Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something to be interested in tourists in Lerica.
"In May, Baku was famous for the Eurovision song festival - and next year we will have the world's oldest people festival," said Fatulaev.
She's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
There is a biography of about eight dozen talyes from these places over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva indicates a black and white picture.
It's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
He had another child at the age of 136.
But the disputed star of the museum is the Chaban of Shirley Müsloumov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person, whose age is documented, is 122 years old, the age of Müslümov is extremely questionable.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
A man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the Müsloum chaban add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Schultz, an age researcher from the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the residents in Central Asia.
"A great number of people of old age can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholtz, "Sardinia also has very many very old people."
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific evidence of age is not possible, as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of refined oil
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerica area are remarkably at the age of biblical.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many people here in the south?
The Azerbaijani instructor Farid Mugimzade explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about nutrition.
Talyshes love meat, bread, and most of the dairy products, many of them drink on a glass of thin oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-caloric diet can be healthy from a dietological point of view.
Or is it the first way of life that keeps people young? In Chengemirina, a tiny village near the city of Lerick, is Rubab Mirzoev.
She's still relatively young at the age of 97 for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of oil she's tired of going over and over.
There are eight people living under the same roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzayeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
There will also be two babies in the area.
In the kitchen, the guests are made tea, which is served in typical empty glass armuda.
Mirzaev has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under her headscarf she hides the long dark-and-pink goats her son is proud to reveal before us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used shampoo," said Mirzaev.
The monthly pension is enough for life.
She's always had what she grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my whole life.
Then she tells me about her husband who served in the army.
The hardest thing was after World War II.
But it was better when Gaydar Aliyev's "favorite father" was at the helm.
The propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows little of the borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
The 230 manats (approximately the same amount of the euro) of Mirzaev receive a monthly pension, a sum that can be well lived for local conditions.
And perhaps the long-growing son of Mirzaeva is also right: "The old people in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
Not a reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution is back in Cairo.
The growing demonstrations in Cairo are a sign of the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution, based on the sharia, has met with a violent opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't miss the pathos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but first and foremost to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, who are still hopelessly divided in a disgruntled opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state in the Nile on the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has a doctorate at the American University of South California really wants to save is not clear to the Egyptians and to the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were carried out in a 15-hour night run with obstacles to an Islamist, 100-member constitutional assembly, which is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings are based on "principles of Islamic law."
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use vague language and the resulting legal loft to better interpret the Shariah.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases concerning the Shariah, the University of Al-Ashar, the country's most important Islamist institution, with a high level of authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in the Council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy is in charge of the law, which would de facto have the effect of restricting the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is being interpreted.
Another problem is that civilians must remain subject to military jurisdiction.
These courts served to suppress opposition members during Mubarak's period of power.
Since the overthrow of the dictator, there have been up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State should protect the "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its moral and values."
It is not legally clear that public institutions will be able to control even the content of films and literature by means of this article.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
At all, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and submisding the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful to say that "human abuse" is prohibited.
Will the cartoon of the president be enough, or would it be a right-wing joke?
The question of interpretation, like much in the draft, which Mursi was proposing for signature and which he said would "very soon" be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back."
The opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been emerging for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and the former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution was "a place in the history dump."
Through Twitter's short news service, he accused Mursi's supporters of wanting to lead a "path against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it down," said the opposition, Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been taken away," cited the Egyptian media as the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not wish to observe the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized "Muslim Brothers" in turn called for a contrary demonstration, but from a precautionary perspective, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under the cover of the Salafites, who cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They said, "Clear the country," and they said, "This is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it all began has provoked a state of almost civil war.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both the opponents and the proponents of the draft Constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
It is now time to let the people decide where the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, this is considered a solution.
"The concept of" human rights "is not mentioned once"
Hafiz Abu Saeed is furious by this fortified constitutional process, which, in fact, should have lasted until February, with the participation of all public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EDP) defended "Muslim Brothers" when they were in prison or tried at Mubarak.
Not because he shared their vision, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested for that.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in a new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The increased influence of Mursi on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing to counsel.
These measures are clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening a civilian State, the de facto President has cancelled it," he regrets.
Democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle on Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a payback.
A demonstration in Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian racket: the worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the country's success is somehow linked to a local addiction to one extremely evil fish dish?
Take some overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get a scent smell of ramphis, one of the most famous Norwegian delicts.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but it's going to have an uncombustible characteristic smell in the air.
The rocket is a trout that has been laid with salt and left in the water until one year, depending on what kind of soul you need to achieve.
As the twilight and the cold go, the crowds of the Northmen are going to the Fagernes festival to celebrate this very, let's say, exciting dish.
"It is eaten with raw and a drink of water, a local TMV," is explained by Howard Halwarsen, a local fireman, who is a professional and compatible "Ramph General," who runs the festival.
People all over us eat small-cut fish and make it a small piece of alcohol.
"Someone more like the water than the raffisk," said Howard.
This drink can scent the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad, it's not that different from a piece of land you've been carrying on a bus for a long time.
The Rakhfisk is a Norwegian product from very different times, times of poverty, when, before the refrigerators, fish were lured in the fall in hermetically closed water barrels.
Then, in the winter, when the fish had already gone well and firmly, it was taken out and, by silencing the perception of alcohol, used to eat.
Also in the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegian people were forced to leave their country in search of employment and emigrate mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent being immigrants, who attract jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a long-standing rival and not so long ago, a much more prosperous neighbour) come to work here.
The Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, if not a few, elements of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears on the world news, and most of the people in the country seem to be doing so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Bravik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "what happened on 22 July."
It is very difficult for the Norwegian people to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and killings.
Norway & apos; s current well-being is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the world & apos; s largest oil and gas industries.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," said Anna, our waitress, who is a sleazy, long-lived, light-haired woman, and a stunning blue eye, the embodiment of Nordical well-being.
We are a people of understanding, as you call it.
Like most Norwegian, she speaks English very well.
We don't like to show up, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil, with most of the oil and gas sector's revenues being invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all were raising money that they did not have, Norway had a good estimate of all costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and go camping in summer, that's enough for happiness," said Anna.
"And there's a rapfisk," she adds with no care.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food, and I'm done with the rake.
A lamb-meat hamburger is an exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But there's still more of the same fish with unforgettable smell waiting for us tonight.
My hotel is having a special dinner on the Raffisk, during which visitors are selected by vote as the best or perhaps the most scent fish.
There's a live television show that shows the lead in a butterfly tie surrounded by a plate with a racphic.
It's like a song contest called Eurovision.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what was your assessment of the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, this is our assessment..."
Everyone's laughing and cheering.
Someone's falling off the chair, probably overtaking the water.
Or maybe just the smell of that fish.
President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico has a difficult career to start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The road traffic in Mexico is in a particularly poor state.
The city is overloaded with transport at a better time, and since Monday, steel barriers have been built, cutting several key roads to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential link and take over the country.
It has a difficult task to do.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which was now assuming its powers, but the country had been devastated by the war on drugs, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has told the people of Mexico that it is ready to fight violence," Mr. Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto & apos; s political career as Governor of his own State of Mexico had developed alongside the President of the United States.
In his home country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, the views of the new leader were divided.
A direct man.
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is being remembered with heat.
The residents are paying tribute to the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort industry and the establishment of infrastructure.
One of the new roads built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which is very different from those with poems and pits that were previously built there, can be accessed to the city.
His name is on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We have the hope of real and serious change with him," said his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from Peña Nieto, an institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was removed in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olver recognizes that after his 12-year-old absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party has high expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also refutes the allegations of lack of content that the new President had put forward to the opposition.
It is very direct and very committed to the realization of its vision for the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesahualkoiotl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the motorway, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe.
Earlier this year, troops were recruited to subjugate the drug-trading gangs in those areas; and violence against women is particularly acute.
In the desert near a large landfill, in the last two years alone, a number of dozens of dead women were found.
More than a thousand women were killed in the State of Mexico during the Governor of Mr. Peña Nieto, a figure much higher than that of the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became sleazy when it came to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto & apos; s opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to deal with the killing of women during his term as Governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A person of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this barren area, Irinea Buendiya is hard to keep her tears from showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana, he committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believed that her cohabitant had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it was like her body was washed before," Ms. Buendia remembered.
There were signs that she was beaten up, and the body was already in the air.
Mariana's mother is retelling this story, and the daughter's portrait is looking at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, on which there is only one word: justice.
That was what they said the family had been denied.
"State officials treated me like an old scoundrel dissatisfied with a scoundrel.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's not right, it's not, especially when there's so many violations and misdeeds, "she says.
President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her by putting on a presidential link on Saturday.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected violence-related crimes, and the new President has promised to make this a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," said Olver, Congressman from Valle de Bravo of the PRI party.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill-treatment, he's on charges.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's detention conditions were harsh.
The US Private Army is being accused of stealing several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leaking of classified material in US history, did not take many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had been able to transfer while in military prison.
During the cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort Mida, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fain, stated that the records of Manning's weekly visits by prison authorities during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence motion to close the Manning case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in itself sufficient punishment was carried out the day after Manning stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with stealing several thousand secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that were completed after Manning's visits by the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was held under strict conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his responses.
When Public Prosecutor Fain asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment of himself by the prison administration as "excellent," and that the general conditions of detention as "very professional."
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fin claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about those problems and that the authorities who visited him had discussed those issues with him and had stated that they would do so but did not record it in writing.
"They recorded" no problems "(after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of a commission that had considered the suicidal intentions he had expressed a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to ensure that he was removed from the "injury prevention" regime and reduced conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the limited regime of detention - lower than that of supervision to prevent suicide - had been introduced to protect the prisoner as well as to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I was all right to have them put an end to the injury prevention regime... to make my standard of living better, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait and that one day he had lost consciousness because of a strong heat.
He explained that it's very difficult, psychologically, when you're not allowed to know how your fate is being resolved, and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world was clung to Camp-Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in that cage. "
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day alone.
Manning says he was only allowed to leave a mattress, a blanket, a helmet, some clothes and glasses.
He says he was trying to move because he was not allowed to sleep or even just to lie in the day.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly struck in the eye by a light that penetrates from the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he was in bed at night, he said that he had been woken and forced to turn on his back.
Manning & apos; s lawyer filed an official objection to Manning & apos; s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he had made during his testimony on Thursday, that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning inspection.
Manning said he was not able to cover for a blanket during the test.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the security guard that he had to throw a blanket that could have been covered, but admitted that no one had expressly ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he was forced to sleep naked the other night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a panty or a slug to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, his slappers and his glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to do during his detention and significantly reduce the length of his sentence if Manning was found guilty by a military court, which was to begin his case at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to invite Manning to confess guilt for less serious crimes and other charges to be held to be excessive.
The resumption of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees under the most strict regime.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally facilitating the release of data on the Internet, transmitting information relating to national defence, and stealing State property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts, he may face a life sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is a story from an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of capacity to exercise themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I went along the arrival corridor, approached the border control area and froze on the ground.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I've been standing in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called a Mexican my whole life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
I later focused on the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
There was no need, in my grandfather's home country, for notional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language-speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and I was in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered that story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues common to the meetings of the Presidents of those countries were immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was willing to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trade block like the EU.
In addition, President Peña Nieto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and long-standing issue.
Most Americans had never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
It is therefore only a United States statesman who is to be told by a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society, that complaints are immediately made about Americans encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are overturned by war.
The most complex, however, are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the offense?
There's enough of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - a father or a grandfather - was unable to realize themselves in Mexico and had to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type - those who were troubled, uneducated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, that's not what they see.
Today, our life is the embodiment of an American dream, we have been in good schools and we have a good job, but we must not forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country we consider to be.
United States of America.
And we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We're telling them the same thing.
They see in us a reminder of the humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class people, as non-real Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our relations with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind a silk curtain by finding a living in the United States, but by losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Mexican Americans are offended by it.
She's a United States citizen, and she thinks she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar Mexican Americans do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of two worlds, you're bound to lose your roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I have learned during my visit, as if our relationship is already not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent them in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is so beautiful at all.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the recent treatment of their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is there a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are rumours that have become common, senseless disputes about who first started; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis, have been killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians had been unbearable in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East had been changed.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have plunged many established realities into a raging storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the storm that has shocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for the hope that this deadly impasse will be overcome.
A war without a winner.
At first glance, the situation is not encouraging.
Even if the ceasefire signed on 21 November is implemented, the clashes that took place this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they have forced Israel to retreat despite its losses.
Although some faction leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements increases in the Arab world, Hamas has new, influential and rich friends.
The emerging regional leader of Turkey, who once was Israel's closest ally among the Muslim countries, expressed support for Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
The derelict supporters of Hamas claim to have established an Islamist month around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, led by the Hezbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, where the increasingly extremist rebels are about to overthrow the authority of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the King's authorities are threatened by Hamas's allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region has taken place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement has been strengthened under President Mohamed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled by Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas's support.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are a very similar organization to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice could not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the strong-line supporters in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli iron dome missile system has justified the cost of its establishment and successfully destroyed many of Hamas's missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the US remained committed to its position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the start of the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
While some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall entering the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and is protecting Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu & apos; s position, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, has been able to join with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Aigdor Liberman, is very useful.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they were given all the power in the West Bank, would they not launch missiles from there towards Israel, as their brethren in the Gaza Strip do?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and stir up any attempt to raise their heads.
It is possible that the hard-line supporters will win; however, their calculations can be refuted in the Arab spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel & apos; s share of its budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours, combined.
The war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to the same extent, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in the Arab countries, the denial of the Palestinian right to self-determination is a slow-down bomb that will explode sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already undermines the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external pulse.
The only solution that is untiring to be called for by reasonable representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israel & apos; s concessions to the territories in exchange for security.
There is still hope, not too strong in the short term, that a ceasefire will allow other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue in its decision to close arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has, more than ever, a beneficial position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also work towards reconciliation between the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to establish a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama also has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he had never submitted his own peace plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continued to show a reluctance to engage in a solution to the problem.
It's a catastrophic short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a law on a unified package for cigarettes has entered into force.
The warning of the damage to smoking and the image of the body parts affected by the disease are contrasted on low-quality green boxes, which are the same for all cigarette marks.
The first Australian law in world practice on the single-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has entered into force, replacing the logo and colour of different stamps with the same box of low-olive colour, with terrible images of sick body parts and images of children whose health is affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various images and statements that warn against the damage of smoking, the only difference between the packs that has been made mandatory since this Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the processing of tobacco packages.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashionable status.
The solution was based on research that showed that people who had not started smoking before the age of 26 had never become smokers in 99 out of 100.
"It is clear that, even at the earliest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to communicate by means of a package," the Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, explains, citing studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the least smokers in the world, so these changes will not have a particular impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
The tobacco industry has been strongly opposed to the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences different from those considered by its initiators," Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws have contributed to business growth.
Sandra Ha, from a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for porcigars and silicone-based T-shirts that hide unpleasant picture on the package has been growing rapidly (almost from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan's Tobaco lost the case in a high court in Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 items to wholesale-trading enterprises and is waiting for a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures was considered by experts to be the popularity of social networks among the target population.
Following the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal the television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sports activities, as well as the prohibition for vendors to place cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertisements on the network, but it cannot limit foreign sites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of moving your product on the Internet would seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, who is looking into public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written on behalf of alleged regular users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't have time and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to the new rules than in advertising.
The tobacco industry had even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: those States had filed claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been subject to unfair restrictions, even though the trade relations of all those countries with Australia were very small.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada first introduced the mandatory placement of smoke-warning photographs.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of strengthening laws is being considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of smokers in Australia are clearly not in line with innovation.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," Victor El Heig explains, buying cigarettes with a picture of the tumour of the carrot on the pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, the head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, claims that the same package made it difficult to place the goods on a shelf.
"It used to take me an hour to unload the new shipment, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and banned cigarettes at all, and we would have said," What to do, all right, it's over, closing the store, "he said, putting his hands up.
It's not a bad thing to miss the world of electronic networks and permanent connections.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical failure and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and it's not much help for books, magazines, iPhone, or even duty-free stores.
However, more and more children & apos; s development scientists and professionals have recently been in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it's not too bad for us and our children to miss.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related issues, which may be conducive to creativity.
And since, in today's world, we are all standing in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us.
Maybe we should be looking for boredom.
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that boredom was an invention of a relatively recent time when people had more time.
This is not the case, according to Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, author of the book "A Lolly History," Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient story," he says.
The walls in Pompeii have found Latin notes of boredom from the first century.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor, University of York, Ontario, Canada, says that understanding and vision of boredom have often changed.
After studying the studies on the subject and asking a 100-person task force, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want but cannot do what they would be satisfied with."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he said, is that a missing person doesn't do anything that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm apathy.
The main thing about the boredom, he said, was "a lack of attention and the resulting deterioration in the mood and the feeling that time is slow."
The description of boredom may seem very depressed.
However, Professor Eastwood claims that, despite the possible link between these states, people who are bored see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people who are depressed see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study "Unemployed mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in September of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment, which participants had heard the recording of the voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sound of a non-relevant television programme in the next room, others heard the same sound on a low volume, so it was hardly possible to disable them, and a third group heard only voice recordings without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard low-volume television noted that they were bored, more often than others, were difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption of attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fensk, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking at the flow of goods on the conveyer to find a marriage, distracting music can help to avoid boredom."
It is believed to continue that when people start to roll on a chair or draw caracoules on a paper sheet, they do so from boredom, but now we know that these actions are actually just helping not to relax physically.
"The study has shown that children who are not prohibited from rushing and entering are learning better and remember more information than children who are being asked to sit down," Professor Fansk says.
At some point, we are all bored: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monoton speech, looking at an uninteresting film.
However, different people show a different degree of propensity for boredom.
In the 1980s, in order to measure these individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "scale of boredom."
Questions and statements are used to determine an estimate on such a scale, such as "Much of what I have to do is one-sided and monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so there's no time available."
Through such questionnaires, researchers found that boys were more likely to miss girls, as Stephen Vodanović, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, said, especially with a variety of external irritations.
In general, however, adolescents are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager with almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said that they were bored outside of school.
However, only 3 per cent of parents indicated that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data on boredom would be now, 21 years later.
He knows, however, that "the age of adolescents is high," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because, in extreme terms, research has shown that it can encourage people to take absurd and dangerous physical action, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanović, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that's boring," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But this very brain doesn't always know what to do.
If you're bored and you put this energy on a guitar or cooking, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only be better off for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child is missing and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight it on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fansk.
"And such self-regulation skills are used in a wide range of situations," he says.
Your child is learning not only to take on his own, he is also learning self-control at all.
I don't think the boredom needs to be exaggerated.
But it's not a bad thing to think of either.
Rather, it should be learned to feel comfortable even without a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it that we need to be bored more often, and that boredom is an extremely unpleasant, inexhaustible desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people are trying to get out of the way and just relax.
"In today's world, we are used to the constant excessive stimulation of the organs of feelings," he says, and when silence comes, we lose and we don't know what to do. "
So far, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old football player and a student at a public college in the south-east of the State of Colorado, is charged with a criminal offence that will soon be entirely legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamara driving in a car on the front of the Kansas border when they were stopped by the police.
After a police officer found a marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco had been ordered to court for possession of drugs and drug-use devices - minor offences, each of which was subject to a fine of $100 - and a trial date had been set.
"We are treated as criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for weeks after the State of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of small court cases is not so much a matter of law as of place.
The charges of minor marijuana-related offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped making charges against 21-year-old and older persons for holding small doses, which will become legal once the law is in force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, the prosecutors had decided to deal with existing cases of marijuana and were still being held accountable for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, there is a vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from entering their places.
"This is all going so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
The control authorities in Washington are also confused with their heads.
They will have to establish rules for licensing the production, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which will have to be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will be a good example," is explained by Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Council for the Regulation of the Production and Marketing of Alcohol Products in Washington.
But now no one can do more, and he recognizes Mr. Smith rather than put forward any proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can be guided by," he said.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will bring the state into a state of uncertainty for a whole year when State licensing systems are not yet in place, and the right of possession of marijuana is now in place.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between a state order on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana, with a ban on trafficking at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading enterprises in the city environment, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explained by Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group "Centre for the legalization of marijuana."
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail message to his subordinates that the City's Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer hold those who had reached the age of 21 responsible for possession of a small number of marijuana and that the police would stop bringing people to light on these violations "from that point on."
The Chief of Police, Oates, reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the regulations governing the activities of persons growing marijuana for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The Ueld District Prosecutor in the North of Colorado, Ken Bak, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After voting on the draft law, he stated that the Public Prosecutor & apos; s Office would continue to be held accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage the users to receive treatment.
At present, 119 persons are charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many are also charged with other violations.
"It is the duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed," Mr. Bak said in his statement.
The response was mixed even in places such as the rural Mesa district, where the voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the district, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of a small number of drugs.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges in cases already under way relating to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that enforcement until it changes is our direct responsibility," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people in Colorado who voted had supported that decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the State and the legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of people in different parts of the state has revealed a mixed attitude of local authorities towards a state experiment with marijuana.
"The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier on this issue," explained by Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of convicted persons for possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on Marijuana.
"They've been following people for so long for this, they can't really accept that this is no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to have a small number of marijuana, are the same as alcohol, to be a pilot field on a country-wide basis to test the very idea of drug legalization.
The legalization agents and State officials plan to expand the area of legalized trade, but they are at the same time looking forward to instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will give up on this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who had used marijuana for medical reasons, the Federal Government had in most cases made a good trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of the Anti-Narcotics Bureau are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the state-controlled recreational marijuana stores, which are authorized under the new law, as Kevin A. Sabite, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado were not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have been opened any more than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, introduced a six-month ban on cannabis herb, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position that we'll give someone a license, and then it'll cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and his older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogy of an antique symposium that laid down two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the University of Oxford's Wooster College, at the end of the '80s, I collected my bags and left, which was the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it, and he cried.
Friends were confused.
The newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I left college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer, E. Norman Wilson, was joking that I left because I had to drink out of a crappy cup.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I went to private school.
I was only poisoned for one reason, and in this famous cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser, Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You're gonna ask me why to think about it now?
According to recent data, a new generation of students with right-centric views is subjected to the same kind of herb.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the College College of Corpus Christy in Cambridge say that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the college equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was further exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "The Country of Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right," in which conservatives were represented by eccentric and neo-Nazi people.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, who is driving in the Rolls Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver overhead.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make "scapegoats because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, age 20, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of the University of Nottingham, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in the university environment, there is a growing shift towards left-hand views.
"People who don't even know us," they think that we are infamous and with impunity for the children of rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, age 21, a student at the University College of Corpus Christi, who had been requested to strengthen protection, called it "unpleasant," and Stephanie Cherill, age 19, the new President of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, said that the attitude of the student club towards right-centric beliefs had deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and to the normal life of the members of the club," she said.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a shy and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford's a little out of hate for a conservative party.
A year earlier, the University had voted out a former student, Margaret Thatcher, for her honorary degree due to a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman's week, when students meet each other and teachers, I felt for the first time what was ahead of me.
I had not yet known that teachers had not only looked through their fingers at the grass of conservative students, but had also been very happy to participate.
Political issues - the mine strike, privatization and the Government & apos; s refusal to impose sanctions against the Government of Apartheid in South Africa - have infiltrated the vast wooden panels of the wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Ms. Wyatt," said the teacher, now dead Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, I got a record.
Harry Pitt was a very yellow man with a face like a cake.
"The Thatcherists don't teach French on principle, or do they just lack the brains?" he asked.
The other students were hovering.
I had tears in front of me.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in your free time, if you're not very busy spinning around in society," Pitt has.
I'm back in my room, completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was alone at lunch, and then someone clapped on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Department of English, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, this is the following:
Every person suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend they're Labour. "
Later, in the local pub, I tried to be cowardly hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
The first-year student of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who was himself in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious. "
Other students got his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How do the conservatives have sex?
- They're hitting each other, aren't they? "
I felt like I must have felt gay until the criminal prosecution was abolished in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I only going to have to meet with like-minded people under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a laborist and hide my real beliefs?
The next three years have become a hell of a lot of oppression and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but also for being a Thatcher foreign policy adviser and one of her speakers.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised him for being provincial, small and committed to a Marxist-Determist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a post of professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started going to Oxford from a parent's house in London, trying to find refuge among family and unbiased capital friends.
I told my dad I hate Oxford and I explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his study in the fortieth years, all political views were taken.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said.
- They can't do that, not in the city of sleeping spies...
Even my communist friends have always been impeccable. "
His moist eyes have been thwarted.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You will break my heart if you leave the university. "
I was tired of going on a regular trip to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, has not taken the pressure and given up his beliefs.
Next week at a seminar, when another history teacher called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In a spirit of shame, I admitted, "I was brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
The front was short.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to hit my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my stalkers surrendered.
When they left, I got a suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a cry and a wiggle.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The more sad it was Oxford, who not only released 14 Prime Ministers of Tori, but to this day is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the elegance of glory."
The "Valentino: A Master of Stitch" exhibition opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous Italian designer clients.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of taking an exhibit on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the time of the opening of "Valentino: a master of sewing," a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unremitting Italian accent.
The exhibition is the final part of history, the only character of which is "or" or "by Garavani, but it could not be written without his named clients.
Valentino always felt like a bewitched, rare and far-off knowledge world.
In the first room of this exhibition, which was opened before 3 March, personal letters and photographs are abundant, signed by the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salim Agha-Khan to Lord Snoudon, including Marie-Chantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social recovery, from a modest tailor from the city of Voger in northern Italy to the world of the international "elite."
Being in love with the royal court is not bad.
"At least they don't give up their cigarettes on your great carpet, like some great pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a great master and takes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his tent in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Hainey" Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beauty like Marella Anyelli or Yevgenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Matza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Matza remembers a charismatic modeler.
One day, we went to his house for dinner, which was after a fashion show in Spain's square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
The style of Valentino has been shown in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her abdomen, in food, in music.
"Each of Valentino's guests has been given a sense of importance and love," he recalls the "top model," the work of which began with the modeler in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she ends.
The parade of the parietal
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous podium of 60 metres into a length that offers a change of role: a visitor takes the place of models and is required to decapitate in the podium, a "audience" from the Greens that are overturned by the cherries of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose to marry Aristotle Onassis, a suit that Monica Viti used in "Nochi" or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to Emperor Farah Dib.
The names of the model are Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and a modeler, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget."
I remember him well.
They were pants, a shirt, a "vest" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Nati Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he highlights our beauty," added the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: there's a lot of light in them and they're "coming up" to his face.
The props are perfect.
The Princess and the legislator of the Pricia della Jovampaola d "Arenberg can't forget the first time she's dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd have a age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
The hour finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a crunch, a "corsage" in a warehouse, and a cut without a tart.
"It was a dream that became apparent," said the widow Rodrigo d "Arenberg."
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinary," explains this Italian aristopque who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d "Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a modeler with" maximum caution... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that accompany him. "
"The King" of fashion
The great end of the Somerset House exhibit - Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months to work and 25 "girls" (as called the model of their stitches) to make this shape of an elephant-coloured silk with a pearl set, 12 different circles and a four-and-a-half-metre helmet.
According to a journalist, Susie Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a high fashion of the late twentieth century, "the return of clients from the highest world."
The old way of life of the elite, now Valentino is her best representative.
The Chief of the Grand Cross (the highest rank in Italy), the Minister of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Words, the Order of the Honorary Legion, Garavani, has collected as much honours as any of his clients' spouses.
"My attention has always been drawn to his tenacity, his calm, his neat and impeccable appearance," "he recalls" Arenberg. "
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a dinner party at the Horse Museum.
He was sitting at a table with a schedule of Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, there's no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The world & apos; s most difficult profession: the miners with Kawa-Irena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur on the top of the volcano on a cool rock path.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living in the Kawa-Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto goes down to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas coming from the depths of the Earth is frozen when in contact with the air.
The result of the large amounts of sulphur, which can be 70 kg in total, is that he puts them in two bamboo baskets, takes the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up on a raging rock road.
To the top of a volcano with a height of 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but it takes more than 40 minutes for worn-out loaders to go up with a turtle step, with difficulty in maintaining a balance and a cautious road in order not to overstep or fall from the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as it did with a French tourist who broke off a few years ago from the Kawa-Izen rock.
The Kawa-Iven shakers make five Eurocents per kilogram of sulphur that they produce.
When they are up there, they make a road between the tourists who take pictures of them, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and when they were tired of carrying heavy baskets, they move three kilometres to the scales that the mining company set up a little higher, at a height of 1,850 metres.
This is the Kandi Ngrimbi PT, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better and better not to say, its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for every kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) to the petrochemical industries, as the mineral is common in daily life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the abating of sugar.
"Since the standard is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (Euro3.8) per walk," explains to us Anto, who usually performs three daily transmissions.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end of the day feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (Euro11.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems like a miser for such a non-human effort, it's three times what he would make in the field.
"The pay paid to miners is very high by local standards, where 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day are paid for coffee collection and the average monthly earnings are two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the loader who used to work as a stone on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the station was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banuwanga, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as the sulphur: "I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got his eyes on toxic gases.
In his 27 years, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawa Iwife, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him, despite the presence of a mask and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes out because of the toxic gases that make the volcano.
It's a price he has to pay for his dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
As a life-penalty, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel tailor, but instead he does the work of a mule.
A dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at 2: 00 in the morning, because the sulphur doesn't stop coming out at night when its characteristic yellow color is turned blue and sneeze in the darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
Some 400 porters carry a basket of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save costs, nor did it provide any equipment to carriers who were working on their own account and with such losses.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per photo, which, together with a 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) entry ticket, the security guards of the reserve are charging tourists who come to take a picture of the volcano and its mules.
"This work is for livestock, not for people," stated by Badrasin, a 42-year-old cordenal carrier who has spent three decades on Kawa Iwife since leaving college.
He is able to raise to 110 kilograms, and he is confident that he will be able to take as much work as he can, because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns its throat and burns its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so tolerant that no one is complaining about their severe diseases... more serious than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder ulcers, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on his back, the Uninick can only raise 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks are transporting to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres along a narrow path among the fences.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," he says, "Uninick, open up a wide mouth that lacks a few teeth."
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, is also a sulphur carrier.
Time is passing, but poverty perpetuates one of the world's most difficult occupations from generation to generation: what human mules do with Kawa-Iken.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and housing and education prices for lack of children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, we'll do our civil duty and make a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a mint bash commercial, but despite this - or possibly because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put bao (bun) in the furnace" to laugh at the fertility rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hoping that through advertising, they will be able to draw attention to the problem in an entertainment form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people do "their national duty."
This thing is just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce such things, so we felt that it was a topic that we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, to launch spirits with pheromones or to organize quick-meet parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, that is, make up a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take it so lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on politics to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low impact.
Singapore is a rich and high-technology city in South-East Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and for its strict public control.
Singapore & apos; s fertility rate, according to its National Population Office, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
It was last below 2 - known as the percentage of replacement - in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Family and Family Policy of the National Population Office, said that the reason for "improved education" and "greater gamma of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a broader range of options for life goals and priorities other than marriage and family creation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of single women and to the postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the fertility rate in Singapore.
However, immigration policies, which are aimed at a sharp increase in immigration in order to counter population decline, are a source of outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is barely hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and being reluctant to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore achieved the worst results in the elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem, through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected impact
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenditure and immigration policy, the case of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts to ensure that so many small housing units are not built.
For example, it has begun to influence the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved on to the control of the number of small apartments known as the "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square metres are very well sold.
However, there is a view that they can contribute to the cold way of life and deny the incentive of developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, the general director of the EL Developers building firm, says that their "shoe boxes" are being sold much faster than the more extensive copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that such apartments are paid for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger ones.
As a result, our money revenues are increasing.
However, he recognized that the new rules provided more clear guidance for developers who had been given a preponderance if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tight.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and so many people are postponing it," says the young management.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word in the area of childbearing is for Singaporeans.
Personal in the offline - personal on-line
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a matter of private or "private life, which is entitled to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does it understand the dangers that are faced when discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, often users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in the personal context, and "password and user name," when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I would not load," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of personal on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On the FB, I'm uploading beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's being stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that it is not good to publish indecent photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge is sure he knows 35 friends who are in the FB and nine of his tweeters.
Most of them are related.
Mother knows, she has a password to one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I only load them," he adds.
"Social media is entertainment, I can talk to long-distance relatives or my friends fast," he says.
Without thinking, he says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count with someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This young man has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter, he recognizes that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one had been able to trust him or ask for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I just remove them from my account," he will.
José became a follow-up to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy has no experience of what is known today as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on the social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not remove the record.
"Just turned on the confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of the steps for setting the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload pictures of people who are familiar in inconvenient or confessional situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a man or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marilos Porras, an English teacher and a teacher in education and education, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has appeared as a means of searching for information, but with these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that the Academy of Mark Prenski, a master of teaching from Yale University and the author of labour, the Digital Aboriginal and Immigrants, has invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginal people are them, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at a age when maturity is not sufficient."
"Also so that they are selective, while most important to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to a specialist, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like a picture of you, like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign party photos, do you ask permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to act online just as they do this offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, human beings are being respected, responsible and other principles, as well as on social media," she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for heads of family to read social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each of the paragraphs, they have a good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for the opening of an Internet record.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be disseminated or published," he said.
According to Gaurie, the key question is to remind children of the "don't talk to strangers" lesson.
The UNASUR Summit ends without the Lima Declaration being published
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory parties.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President & apos; s Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be made available after closure, but then confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government & apos; s website at some point.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Olyanta Umala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit has been limited at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast, in the press room, with a message "closed session, sound is prohibited."
A few information that was distributed to reporters was provided by the press secretaries of some of the Governments of UNASUR who were present at the meeting but not by Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which caused discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
The Office of the President of Peru subsequently sent an electronic media message to the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was a statement by Umala, not an official document, which had concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and at that time, despite the press's insistence on doing so, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, had not been circulated either.
The official ASPA website can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had made efforts to ensure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but had limited information to the maximum extent possible.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinheiro, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which would begin the hearing of the statements of both parties on Monday in The Hague, in the context of the charges that Lima had brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently representing in this international court," said Umal, next to our Chilean colleague.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals," added Pierre, and welcomed the fire of Umalu's hand against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they were under the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia had challenged the Bogotá Pact this week, according to which it had recognized the subordination of the verdict of that international court after the decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a mistake.
The Summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership of UNASUR had been suspended since 2011, following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, had not participated in the meeting.
The host President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon on the time of Lima.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for South American countries, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreements."
He said that action was being taken to improve "cooperation against the insecurity of citizens and against organized transnational crime, to increase access to drugs, to low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the risks of natural disasters in a combined and effective manner."
As Europe is in crisis, "economic integration (Latin America) should not have a triumph, but should serve to expand our productive base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Umala.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31-digit projects that will improve South American space connectivity, especially in rural and border areas... by bringing our countries together and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian President in a read-out.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were in Peru and were limited to the list of axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations," from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have a good relationship between its neighbours, is another theme that was emphasized at the summit.
In that sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before taking part in a regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortekei, on Saturday in Mexico City, to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute as a result of a verdict of an international court challenged by Bojoi.
"The day after tomorrow, perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortetei," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including a pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will be present for the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also in the framework of the Summit, the Group & apos; s Defence Ministers met provisionally to adopt the Action Plan 2013, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told the State television of Peru that the Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one property."
He has, in this context, protected a project for the establishment of South American citizenship, which is endorsed by the participating countries of UNASUR.
"There is a need for the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back," he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also been a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C. and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured that he did not regret that decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but rather respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in due course "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed."
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning of an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of a deterioration in the physical and mental health of Assanj.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a little pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What is really present is the risk of his physical and mental health being degraded by flooding in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assanjo since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of integrity that would allow him to go to Ecuador, was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the flooding of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, but we do not use that word here, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is engaged in a number of proceedings in various European bodies," he mentioned.
And he said, "If Britain provides a guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it is well allowed by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogate Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or question him on Skype, tomorrow the problem will be over.
Correa took this opportunity to show himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he was not able to tolerate "mediocrity, inintegrity and lies that distorted freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom are not spoiled villains, but bad journalists who support the search, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he remained pleased that neither those journalists, "the bankers nor the bourgeois-hegemons, were dominant in Ecuador," and added that, as re-elected, "would deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and should not tolerate opportunism and support for the coup under the mask of legitimacy," because "in fact it has" destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy. "
The Ecuadorian President also considered "well-founded" the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being implemented at this time.
This is a problem between the South American and the Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They must be processed together in order to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed his hope for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute in the same court of Peru and Chile and stated that "it is right for Latin America to apply to international authorities if two countries undertake to take a decision, however heavy it may be."
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was difficult."
Correa assured me that if he lost in the February 2013 election, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations like Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only by political authorities.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed that possible victory, so that responsibility had to be recognized," he said.
If won, it would be my last term as President, and then we will be out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the health of President Chavez," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS analysis had been positive.
"I've been mutilated," he remembers that difficult, despite the doctor's act, the moment.
The young man kept it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts had been justified - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients at the Hospital Hospital of the Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he went in 1994, after many obstacles were overcome.
He has been living with the diagnosis of the "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would be difficult to believe that there were too few treatment options at the time, too little knowledge of the disease, too little prejudice to the sick.
For example, even the director of the Mexican Social Protection Institute did not want to say good-bye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, at that time, having AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and do so without affecting the quality of life.
However, without knowledge of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already done damage, have "exhausted" their immune system and are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the first reported cases of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement to date is that the patient's survival, which is beginning treatment in a timely manner, and that of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV section of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV / AIDS activist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depended on the degree of damage to the immune system available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years, with a number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when 500 CD4 were reported.
Simply put, the above means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "supporting control, can live without problems up to 75," he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died since AIDS was introduced.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people had died in 2011 and 187 had already been reported by May of that year; however, there had been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I can imagine it, this is what's going on in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of drugs, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected state, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He said that "Nine out of 10 patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on total mortality is to be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide mass-scale detection samples for all people who request it."
In his proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had referred to a private laboratory for verification, were only motivated by his friend & apos; s actions and, despite his young age, had already been at the stage of AIDS and had even suffered from a carcoma of Caposhi, a cancer which was a common problem.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather be up three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do exercises, I take drugs.
To date, his parents only know he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, care for myself and for another person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILIO JALISCO, in order to make his statement to those who are now in fear in the context of World AIDS Day.
If they have a risk of infection, they should know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, they should know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
His presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gap between health-care programmes and a simple citizen is great, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who has been working on the HIV issue.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places where this is a challenge, "there's actually an increase in the distribution of condoms, we've been given one or two before, and now we're given a 100-pack, which is very good, but it turns out there are those who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" is a popular question, with the faggot and condemnation of social workers, school counsellors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear the teenagers, who have assured the promoter.
I suggest that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms be not only behind the counter, and that a hundred be held in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not an encouragement of discord.
It is not a matter of payment for beer and a motel, but the Governor, Emilio González, replied when asked whether the distribution of condoms under his leadership is possible.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
A total of 13.435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been recorded.
The State ranks fourth in the national rating for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are in the sexual route, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent through the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know this for one registered case.
In view of the United States Court of Appeal & apos; s ratification of a decision that would overturn the restructuring of the Vitro Group & apos; s debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario set a precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that had capacity to pay.
It seems that the procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of Judge Harlene Hale & apos; s decision of 15 June in the Northern Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms defenceless in the face of the possibility of seizing their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opened the doors to the leading glass producer in Mexico for application to the United States Supreme Court, providing evidence of three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge states that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the competition proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph refers to the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote recognized in the critical mass of the competitive production of the debt that the parent company had with the branch of Vitro, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debt was guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Proceedings.
It is also true that, by subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro, who fought against him in United States courts, namely the "vulture" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
The Court of Appeal is disclosing these data.
On the other hand, he accused Vitro of the difficult situation that he had been facing since 2008, which had been affected by the serious economic crisis that had struck the United States by attacking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote will reach its plenary, that is, five judges, given that only three have voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate would be submitted, which would require a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in the present case by the United States Supreme Court.
The worst part is that the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as an amicus curiae ("a friend of the court"), which described the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it was exonerating itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carambolo from two sides: they hit the Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
In view of the several-month-long complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is charged with fraud, the airline pilot trade association has already found a bottle throat.
The body led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just submitted a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory body has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the F / 589 bank's trust fund, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be allocated to the purchase of shares from the Professional Management Company of hotels.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
surrounding Dragon Mart
Meeting at a forum at the Caribbean University during the weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of common civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counter the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant centre for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from an isolated country, with a residential area near 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously been able to bring together the governors of the south-east zone to confront the monumental forces, which had levelled some of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
With regard to the Government & apos; s rejection of the Senate & apos; s request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan has signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been brought into the archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out, despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to settle long-term debt without affecting the short-term, the Homex housing developer places 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer of interest every 28 days.
The competition is coming into the world.
Established by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competitive has just come to light, the aim of which will be to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area is over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hettin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hettin's long-standing basketball traveler, Reyes, has been associated with this sport for over 60 years and has been driving the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have so many basketball stories in their memory, like Hector "Hettin" Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhage tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-class player, a player of the High Basketball League, a commissioner and leader of BSN with the Bayamon Cowbos and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as when I was president of BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes remembers during his visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal husband for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all of which were decorated by photographs and memorable items collected for his long journey, are evidence of this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was able to be part of the eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, a co-agent or a leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's debut at BSN.
Since then, the Cuco Ortiz, who was the great administrator, has continued to be led by Reyes.
I remember that Jean Barts, who was on his way here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player, 6 '7, for you."
"You want some?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Barts then recommended a sniper, Raymond Gousse, who got a nationality and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the Bayamon Championship, Gass would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' Championship with Gass, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and that of Minsi in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the United States during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the 1990 World Cup came, where we got fourth place, and it was supposed to be a bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as is the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that since the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the US team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did the team again play Minsi, Gaussa, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Piculina' (Ortiza), but also young (Javier) 'Toniito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers of León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quihoye' Morales, who were unable to participate in 90 because of knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualification tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito 'Nieves, Pablo Alisea, and young Rolando Hurruitner, in place of the players who were suspended for disorder at the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated that level in the way Pikulin did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the various league he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s there were up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce only play in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now, guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the benefits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch the music video of my age on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Isabel, who has always been with me.
He died an actor, Larry Hagman.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Werth, Texas, became world-famous because of his main role as John Ross Ying, more known as "J.R.," in a series of "Dallas," in which he introduced a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil predator by J. R. Ying on the Dallas television series was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night because of complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement made for The Associated Press by Warner Bros. a Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his favorite hometown, Dallas, once again playing a familiar role that he most liked," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He was happy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, fun, sweet and talented, and I'm gonna miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," he confirmed Gray in his statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver zirrosis in 1992 and admitted drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor in his liver and had a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became known on television because of a role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," which was broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changing when he meets an attractive young genie girl, who is playing Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedians who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included roles well accepted by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his workshop interpretation of the most abominable J.R. that led Hagman to the top of the glory.
A dramatic series of CBS on the Yings clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who Shot in J.R.?" commercial slogan designed to make a noise around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killing has created international debate and millions of dollars that were at risk in the bookies.
It also helped bring a record audience into the show at that time.
When the November 1980 episode responded, an average of 41 million viewers saw it and turned Dallas into the second-most-seen entertainment program in history, after the end of MASH in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was the brother-in-law of J.R., Christine, who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened her that she would charge her with prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ying as an unsavory, charismatic smiles of corruption: an unhonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be treated.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R. 's grave stove," Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "There will be an honest citizen of J.R. Ying."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princepal, also a hero of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "big, both on and out of the screen."
He is unforgettable and indispensable to millions of people around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season was completed and the sixth was in production, reporting the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
He was the son of an actress and singer, Mary Martin, who was born in the classic works of South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 during his marriage to counsel Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the English Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or influencing them in any way," he said, "Prensa Asociada at the time."
After a liver transplant, he started to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it's a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course is beginning, which is being studied by "End of the World."
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when a professor of religion, Stuart Sharma, decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible decoy: the end of the "long back-end" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, which many people had captured as proof that the end of the world would come.
But Sharma had no idea what he was expected in the next couple of months: a catastrophic hurricane, Sandy, a financial crisis that some call a "longarmageddon," and a growing conflict, where Israel is going to go, where Christian late-time theorists think the Apocalypse is going to begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we were to look at what's going on in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad is good for people with apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers "end-of-world" courses this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Associate Professor Barry Wacker is a course entitled "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We are analysing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could take place.
This month, students analysed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they related to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," said Waker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, a Latin American history professor, Matthew Restall, and his colleague, Amara Solari, an associate professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called "The End of the World."
"We do not add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world does not come," said Restall.
Despite "imminent destruction," students must study, prepare projects and take final examinations.
In the Penn State, the final examination will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night on which the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The places ended in two hours," said Restall about his high-grade course for 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks before the semester from people who asked if there were any more places.
The students, in turn, make sure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridget Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a question of comfort or lack.
Will Veces, a 25-year-old student in psychology and sister's affairs, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach that," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - not to mention the professor - said they believed on the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project affected the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there was apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which had been for centuries, where people were responding to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculation.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Most of all in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at La Sal University, who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered a question as to whether he knows any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not take part at the end of the world," he wrote to the higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had been mentioned for a long time, and said that if nothing were to happen on 21 December, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or to think that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are indifferent to that date.
Some said they were going to end-of-world parties.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," said Samir Ford, a 20-year-old in the Department of Communications.
