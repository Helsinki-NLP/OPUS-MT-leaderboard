There are still meetings ahead of them to prepare and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably be fine by now.
But first of all, I think we need to add to a component such as unity.
I think we have a problem with that.
The Kremlin supports a ban on smoking on balcony houses

TikTok hides unsuitable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide is over 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok is censored by the video, which refers to Tiananmen, Tibet's independence or the prohibited Falun Gong religious group, which is a story by The Guardian.
The documents submitted to the publication indicate that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance), through an application, is promoting China's foreign policy objectives abroad.
Most of China's policy violations fall under "incitement to hatred."
In each case, TikTok places unsuitable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the social network's actions do not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or of genocide in Cambodia falls under "distortion of China's history or other countries."
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of 20 "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, Indian policy of Mahatma Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Premier Sinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyun Hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Premier Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as described in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and may result in a user being blocked.
The second category is not too severe: such publications remain on the website, but their distribution is limited to the TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are out of date and are no longer being applied: "We are now using a local approach for modelling, as well as independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, and they are told by the co-founder of the "Production Centre" by Rustem Bogdanov.
The "Production Centre" is a Russian media company that is officially working with TikTok.
All the promotional materials of the "Production Centre" bloggers are agreed with the social media, but user materials can be placed without agreement and are handed over to Bogdanov.
In order to ask whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers positively and says that he has seen such publications.
With Bogdanov, the founder of the Agency Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: No shocking content, discriminatory statements, etc.."
But you can put any content under these rules that the simulators don't like, notes Zaripov.
The Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide is over 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
According to a user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social media administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: the neuronetwork analyses the faces and determines how many years a person looks, tells the Bogdanov.
If the neuronetwork decides that the user is younger, the account can be removed, he adds.
According to the BBC, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the WWork carpet in September 2019.
The people of Istanbul reported on the earthquake in the city.
The severe earthquake caused panic in the largest city of Turkey

In Rosdeen, the results of the hand-amputation test were reported to the child
The child in Rostov oblast was amputated because of an error by the doctors, reporting "The View" with reference to the site of the territorial authority of Rosdjevo.
An 11-year-old boy broke his hand, and then he was given a cast at the Zernograd Hospital.
After a while, the child developed a gangrene and was amputated.
The audit found that the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and amount of assistance provided, had been disrupted.
The verification materials have been transmitted to the SC of the Russian Federation for the region.
URA.RU had previously reported that he had been arrested by the Chief Medical Officer at the Yuhnoralsk Hospital.
The Russians have been warned of false bank calls.
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters, who are replacing the bank's phone number.
This is reported by the "Commercial" with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted to the communication operators more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which the clients of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked and in 59 cases there was a restriction on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the ECB, Artem Sochev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had been faced with the replacement of the number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warning of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the "Communication" Act.
At the opening bank, the Rosbank and the Alpha bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a change of number.
According to the Bilina press service, some of the information on the fraudulent calls that the KB had given to the KB was incorrect: the lists included numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their closure would lead to a disruption of the organization's work.
Artem Sochev said that the Central Bank was planning to establish a number base for the fraudsters, to which the communication operator would contact at every call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

Stoltenberg discussed with the Green Accession of Ukraine to NATO
The NATO Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, and the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Green, discussed Ukraine & apos; s membership in the alliance on the fields of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was mentioned by the gensek during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had actually discussed the issue and also stressed that, in their response, Ukraine had not been given a time frame for its accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance was obliged to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards was writing RT.
In Crimea, the Green Alternative has been offered a course in NATO.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, instead of the NATO accession course, should work to establish good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic, Crimea Roman Chegrinc, reported this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat his predecessor's mistakes, but should listen to Donald Trump's advice, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish a relationship with the President of Russia," said the Chegrin to the RIA News journalists.
The Chechen noted that Green is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that the Ukrainian President would only be able to remain in power if relations were established with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on 27 September, NATO's gensek, Jens Stoltenberg, reported that he had held a discussion with the Green on the country's accession to the alliance.
He said that Ukraine was obliged to meet certain conditions for that purpose.
On 5 June, the deputy welcomed Yevgeny Balicki, who said that Ukraine & apos; s possible accession to the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Nemara.
The Spanish "Barcelona" and her former footballer, a Brazilian Nemar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the assailant's transition to French "Pari Saint-Germain."
The case almost reached trial, but the Catalans offered the player a solution without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they refuse him return.
Nemar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of a Brazilian, have had an interesting focus: under an agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
After just a year, however, he ended up in PSW for a record Euro222 million.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club also owe him interest on late payment.
When Neimar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Sine-grenade claims that the bonus was for the full contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considered that the player had only one quarter of the 40 million euros and required a return of a proportional portion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Nemar and "Barsa" almost agreed on the return of the "bloodiest" player in Catalonia's loon.
It's true that the deal is gone, but there's still hope for a back-up of the forward.
So, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in a pre-trial manner, that would make it impossible for the Brazilian to return.
Namar himself wants to come back so much that he's asked for assurances that the Catalans will buy him back.

The current seventh Council of the Bank of Estonia is composed of, in addition to Laar, Liina Tonisson, Kaya Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Yaanus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Ann Listra and Rhine Minka.
On the proposal of Laar, two members of the Council, Kallo and Tonisson, were to be replaced, and Laar was proposed by Enn Eusmaa (Central Party) and Ivari Padar (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted that instead of Yaanus Tamkivi, Andr√©s Sutte would be on the board.
But Laar replied that the purpose of the Reform Party was to obtain two seats on the Council of the Bank of Estonia - that, in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, Andr√©s Sutte would be part of the Council.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riygikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members of the Council of the Bank of Estonia.

The rooms in central Moscow are given at the price of an apartment on the outskirts.
Despite the decline in the number of communaries in Moscow, there is no demand for them.
The supply is driven by demand through room delivery.
In central Moscow, the rental of rooms is more expensive than on the outskirts, mainly because of high demand.
At the same time, the rooms in the centre are given at the price of apartments on the outskirts.
For example, the average rent price for the room is 28,000 roubles in Hamovzek, as described in the study of the "Apartment World" portal.
For that money, you can take a single-handedness off the MCAD.

The cheapest rooms in Moscow are given up in Capotna, with an average of 13.6 roubles per area.
The second place in the low-cost area is in the district of Biruleft, West (13.8 thousand).

The most expensive area for MKAD was the Sun, where rooms are given up in almost 16,000 roubles per month.

It is possible to pay a pension not only from the Russian Federation Pension Fund but also from non-State pension funds.
The NPF is a private company, reporting to the Volgograd Truth.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them and, over time, you get your money back with interest.
If you're interested in this, first, look at the information on the NPF on the Bank of Russia website.
All funds are subject to uniform rules established by federal laws.
The pension points can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years you have not been able to pay your pension.
This is a method that is appropriate for those who have worked informally.
In addition, a contribution could be made for a relative, such as a housewife.

Which club will take the released one on the parole, Paul Mamaev.
The Futbolist Pavel Mamayev, released last week from the parole colony, will not return to the Red Nodar football club.
A former half-protector of this club can soon sign a contract with the Rostov FC, which is reported by the Championship portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the representatives of Rostova and Mamaeva are now in their final stages.
It is expected that a contract with a 31-year-old football player will be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sport Express states that Pavel Mamayev was to be examined at the Moscow Dinamo the day before, but the test was not carried out because of the "uncertain situation in the club."
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamayev last week, as agreed by the parties.
The middleman has been playing for the Red Dari Club since 2014.
He won the Russian bronze twice with the team.
Previously, Mamaev was in favour of the Moscow Torpedo and CICA.

A man with a samurai sword tried to resist a cart found in a dumpster.
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after being slammed by a samurai sword on his opponent in a dispute because of a cart found in the garbage.
A 54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging into a bunch of garbage near an empty house.
It was observed by Todd Beavers, who went on a night walk.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart among the scumbags.
Miller saw Beavers' finding and was upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he started digging in the trash first.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed a cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers at his house.
Miller took the sword out of his knife and started waving them in the direction of the cart kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller what's going on is on video.
After seeing a video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to come back.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Shortly after that, he saw a woman who was not familiar entering his yard and took a cart, screaming at his insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager had attacked a woman who was not familiar and injured her with a sword.
In this way, he responded that the guests at the wedding that he was celebrating at the same hotel where he stopped were not allowed to smoke.
Mass riots on three
The Moscow case against the participants in summer protests is further divided into separate fragments and is losing political content.
The evidence of the very fact of "mass unrest" is not being verified, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of the charges.
The failure of the case should inspire society, but would certainly leave the power forces whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence would be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass unrest) - Alexei Minjalo was unexpectedly released from detention without any obligation and, after a few hours, rehabilitated: UPC withdrew his charges.
Minyalo was under arrest for almost two months and has been joined by several professional communities: historians, priests and writers.
The case then left only two accused persons (13 initially accused): Sergei Fomin, who was placed under house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabah, who was arrested until the end of December on the eve of the trial (also accused of violence against a member of the authorities, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The Court sentenced the author of a special petition for Latvia & apos; s accession to the United States
The Court of the Vidzemsky estate of Riga sentenced the author of a special petition for Latvia & apos; s accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartetecki.
It is noted that men have been assigned 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"The common sense is not the strongest part of our system," he commented on the Bartetsk Court's decision.
He also added that punishment was usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time, Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and its withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way were signed on the website.
It is noted that the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the Republic of Latvia, "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia," has been the subject of criminal proceedings against Bartetsk.
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of an online petition for Latvia's accession to Russia had received six months of prison.
In Khabarovsk, an emergency landing was carried out by a Japanese airliner.
Boeing, from Austria to Japan, made an emergency landing at Khabarovska airport, reporting to TASS.
The aircraft belonging to the Japanese company ANA was carrying 206 persons, including 12 crew members.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposes to punish the abuse of police officers on the Internet.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect the police against the dissemination of defamatory and indecent information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the draft law was issued on the federal legal portal, and the draft instrument has not yet been published.

On 12 April, Roskomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time, blocking the Yaroslav edition of 76.ruv.
Shortly thereafter, the Chudovsky District Court of Novgorod Region fined a local resident of 30,000 roubles for placing on the network "two notes of information in indecent form, which is an affront to human dignity and public morals and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the State and the authorities exercising State power in the Russian Federation."

Earlier in September, it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning to make another reduction in housing credit rates before the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogen and phytoandrogens help to extend youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens has been poorly studied.
The most famous is pine dust.
The phytoestrogen are well-studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer).
The known sources of phytoestrogen are all the beans (the most popular is soy), hmel, and the seeds of the lion.
However, many experts believe that such Bades cannot be a full substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by too many from the outside.

He's got a huge story and a great cheerleader.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the city's authorities will give them their own club back. "

The Hidrometh Center has called the right people's marks.
There's a lot of people in Russia that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them are working.
At the HidromethCentre, they checked all the impurities that were allegedly working.
The meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, really, in the short term.
As the scientific leader of the Russian Hidromett Centre, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the race, the next day will indeed be a chase, as our ancestors have pointed out.
And if the sky is light, then the next day will be rain.
The second working example is based on bird surveillance.
They say more about the paws, if they fly low, it's usually by the rain.
This is explained simply - when the air humidity is high, the mosquitoes are wet with wings, and the peppers are forced to decline to hunt insects, and they write TAS.
There are people's marks on different continents.
It is a traditional people's holiday in the United States and Canada, which is celebrated every year on February 2.
It is believed that on that day, you should watch a surrogate coming out of his hole to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil spots were found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
The pollution was scattered over 2,000 kilometres of the coastline.
The first oil stains found began to be reported as early as the second September.
However, their number continued to increase every day up to a quarter, as did their territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out that all of them are identical, and it is crude oil that is involved.
In the State-owned Petrobras oil corporation, which had been submitted for analysis, the samples found, stated that they were not in conformity with the oil produced from the deposits in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It may be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And she probably got into the ocean, "said the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the Petroleum Workers' Union of the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
At the beaches of four of the eight affected States in the north-east of the country, environmental defenders found nine sea turtles fully covered with oil film.
And only two of them were able to save.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute & apos; s specialists encourage tourists and local residents to circumvent oil stains and to report all contaminated sites found.
Medvedev has requested a review of the general-purpose business standards.
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev has instructed Roszuzadnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Commerce, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to review the health and epidemiological rules and regulations for general-purpose organizations.
They will also have to look into the transition to the requirements of the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union to apply to nutrition management.
The authorities are required to submit their proposals to the Government no later than 15 October, and are listed in Mr. Medvedev's list of mandates following the 11 September "Dialogue" programme on the Russian 24 television channel.
By the same time, Mr. Medvedev had instructed all the agencies mentioned, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to make proposals for an experiment to limit control activities for general-purpose organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad oblast, effective 1 January 2020.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have been requested to submit to the Government, before 11 November, a bill amending the Code of Civil Procedure on the application of administrative suspension for the violation of food requirements, which has caused health damage.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Health and Health should consider a gradual transition from 2021 to a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that would allow for a full diet of healthy food.
It will be recalled that the business community has been talking about outdated requirements after a caf√© from the Anderson network was closed.
The business community had called for the abolition of the existing SanPines, and Roszuznadzor had announced the joint development of new ones.
There were 33 agencies on the list.
In the meantime, Rosuzuznadzor intends to reduce the number of health standards and regulations by 40 times by 2021.

A man was armed in the Skuratov district of Tula.
He was stealing batteries and machine guns from the cars.

There's nothing for the Russians to put on retirement - V. Matvienko.
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation of Valentin Matvienko believes that the Russian people do not have sufficient savings to give full effect to the draft law on the guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing the pension through personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another thing, how timely we have it.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has income, from which they simply have nothing to provide for an increase in the future pension," said V. Matvienko.
The Russian people, in the opinion of the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and payment of pensions, since "permanent changes in this area have completely confused them."
That does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we must do our utmost to ensure that the level of pensions and the social security of citizens are improved.
But steps in this direction must be thought out, responsible, taking into account national realities, "said V. Matvienko," RIA News. "
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) is to be developed, there must be a number of basic principles, including volunteerism, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strong guarantees and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance announced that a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GWP) would be agreed upon.
Its main elements are the only voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guarantee the security of long-term pension savings by the State, register the citizens & apos; savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

The expert told me why we should give up the tea in the bags.
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that more than 10 billion microplastic particles were made into a cup of tea in five minutes.
The package drink can also add opium particles, said Nation News an expert in the field of food safety, Elizabeth Tikonov.
According to the agronome, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
The decks are not thrown out at the end of the season, so they may be in the tea.
"Indeed, it is not always tea plants that are included in the packages," said Tikonov.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of tea for distribution, which was being sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in composition but also in the method of its production - the particles were heated to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"The best way to buy clean green or black tea is to have the least of the additives in such a drink," the expert said.

Regions were invited to share business support secretaries
As the "Parliamentary Gazette" was known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to Maxime Oreskin, Minister of Economic Development, and Anton Siluanov, Minister of Finance, inviting him to express his position on the initiatives of Federation entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish interregional links
The Committee on Economic Policy of the Council of the Federation has compiled information from the regions on their business development and the legalization of self-employed, as well as on the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions presented the challenges of SME development to the senators and made proposals for improving existing legislation.
"To date, there is insufficient communication between regions, with the result that the business community in all regions of the senators' visit has identified the lack of information on regional programmes for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," noted Andrei Kutepov.
In an annex to the letter to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of proposals and issues from the regions (available from the drafting).
In addition to the line ministries, regional summary data are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.

Useful experience
Today, programmes to support small and medium-sized business actors have been adopted and are being successfully implemented in many regions of the country.

Self-employed continue to be removed from the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made to support small and medium-sized enterprises more effectively.
For example, the Archangel region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "business activities," as this "is most appropriate to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the Ivanovskaya region, there is a need for amendments to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities relating to the separation and repair of housing, long-term construction and physical training.
The Bryan region considers it important to strengthen the control of unscrupulous dairy producers through the Mercury Veterinary System.
And in the Kostrom and Magadan regions, they advocate that the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship be incorporated into the legal and regulatory fields.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislation.

Subsequently, on 20 September, at the request of the Attorney-General & apos; s Office, the Court changed Ustinov & apos; s preventive measure from detention to non-departure.
For example, the petition for the release of Ustinov had more than 112,000 signatures in a day.

The supply of "sanctions" to Russia has fallen 100 times.
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries, compared with 3 million 442.2 tons in the same period in 2013, and Interfax.
However, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion to $975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that were not subject to the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the drop-out of prohibited products was offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
We recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from entering Russia under counter-sanctions, until 31 December 2020.
The document on the official legal information portal indicated that the rules had been extended for a further year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The destruction order was originally applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine joined the list.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the "sanctions" that are being smuggled into the country (food-embargo products that Moscow introduced in response to the West's anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of "sanctions" food by any legal means.
As the sanctions of the West continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
The measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kg.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously called "just immoral" the destruction of food, which he said had a negative impact on the education of people.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for consumption was launched in early June by Rosuzuznadzor.
The Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation then made a similar recommendation to the Government.
And the Vice-Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Alexei Gordeev, said that it was not right to destroy food, and we need to think about how to use it for a purpose by assessing quality.

In Chile, a 1 billion euros telescope has been built.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ECO).
According to ESO, the construction of the E-ELT building dome (European Extremely Large Telescope - "European Superlarge Telescope") has been officially started this week, while the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project is being implemented.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 six-angle segments with a size of 1.4 metres.
It is a huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 metres diameter, that will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to search for the Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the areas of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome has just begun, the mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other professionals for three years, since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about 400 million euros, was awarded by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
