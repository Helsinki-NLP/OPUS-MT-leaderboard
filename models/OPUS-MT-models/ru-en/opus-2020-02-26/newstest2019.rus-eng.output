Number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbas
Andrei Marochko, the spokesman of the People ' s Police of the self-proclaimed Luhan People ' s Republic (LPR), stated that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans to "something to complement the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals have led to low staffing of the units," said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not exclude that the real numbers of Ukrainian conscripts could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called Anti-Terrorism Operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JF).
This measure was intended to strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbas was exacerbated by the assassination of Alexander Zaharchenko, head of the DNR.
The DNR authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the bombing were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that Ukrainian intelligence services had organized the sabotage.
The U.S. authorities forced Mask to resign as chairman of Tesla's board.
American businessman Ilon Mask will resign as chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla, which he founded, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
An entrepreneur will also pay $20 million to settle federal Securities and Exchange Commission claims.
According to CNBC, the pre-trial arrangement with the agency allows Maska to remain at the head office in Tesla.
In doing so, he is obliged to pay $20 million and to resign as chairman of the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is clarified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders by claiming that there were sufficient funds to buy the company's shares and had sued the entrepreneur.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy out Tesla shares for $420 a grand, but he never did.
After tweeting, the company's shares grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison.
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the EU to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of taking the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to believing in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wishes to escape from captivity," the Minister said.
He added that trying to punish Britain for deciding to leave the EU would only exacerbate the crisis, noting the "Gazeta.ru".
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May announced that the Brexit talks had reached a stalemate.
That was how she commented on the outcome of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was taken in 2016 by referendum.
The United Kingdom ' s withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained about the malfunction of the new version
iPhone users complained about problems in the work of Telegram's messenger after an update on September 28.
User's phone number can be found on his computer.
The complaints relate to gadgets with an up-to-date iOS 12 operating system.

The Messenger's representatives reacted to the malfunction.
They said that migration of information to a new app written in Swift might be a problem.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until the problems were corrected.
On April 13, the Tagan Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's claim to block Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communication operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was the failure of the Messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decipher the correspondence needed to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its confidentiality policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected user terrorism suspect when obtaining a court decision.
Telegram audience declined by 1.2 million after blocking in the Russian Federation

Ilon Mask is forced to resign as head of Tesla's board of directors.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask settled their dispute in the fraud case.
CNBC News reports it.
According to the television channel, as part of the agreements reached, Masku will have to resign as head of Tesla's board of directors.
In doing so, the commission allowed Maska to retain Tesla's leadership.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be collected from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American businessman on the list of the 50 richest people on the planet's Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX Corporation, Neuralink's neurotechology company, and Tesla's electric car developer, as well as Paypal's co-founder.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla's CEO, Ilon Mask, because of his Twitter report on the company's possible ransom.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all stock on the stock market at a fixed price of $420.
The equity value of $420 was allegedly "due to the importance of this number in marijuana culture", reported earlier by Bloomberg with reference to the Co-Director of the Security Department of the Stephen Pakin Commission.
At the same time, Ilon Mask subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and sad about the claims.
"The integrity is the most important asset in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, Tesla's shareholders filed a class action against Mask complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the positions of businessman had resulted in losses.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the business tweet was misleading, forcing Tesla stock sellers to purchase papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that Ilon Mask's careless statements had led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska also accused the head of the research company Citron Research of trading fraud.
In the meantime, if Mask had not been able to settle his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been at risk of being removed from the company's management and even jail.
The former Chairman of the Commission, Harvey Pitt, announced this to CNBC.
The mask is "not a bad guy who doesn't know how to run a car company."

The RTC compared the possible renaming of the CPI to the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (OCC) of the Moscow Patriarchate mitropolitics of Volololam Ilarion compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in Germany.
Mitropolitan of Volololam Ilarion - on the causes of the conflict with the Constantinopol Patriarchate, possible religious divisions and its political implications
According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage", renaming the church is like in fascist Germany "Jews to wear a yellow six-point star".
"It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it was for that purpose that this bill was created," said the RTC representative on the television channel Russia 24.
The Mitropolitan also stressed that the UTC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since "the church's believers consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country".
UPC called on the Constantinopolian Exarchs to leave its territory
Gran Prix in Sochi: Anshalag, Russian car and Quyat ' s return
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
This was announced by Russian Vice-Premier Dmitry Kozak, who summarized the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of Russia's Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Vice-President of the Government also shared his views on the return of Daniel Quyat to Toro Rosso and appreciated the attendance at the Russian stage of Formula One.
The result of our meeting with car manufacturers should be the creation of the Russian Formula One car, which has no equivalent in the world, Dmitri Kozak said in the foreseeable future.
We have to instill our automakers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I don't think that's possible at this time.
I think it's more realistic in the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, "Formule 1" was licensed by the Russian team "Marusia".
According to the Vice-Premier, there are already investors willing to invest in the creation of a domestic team at the Formula One World Motor Race Championship.
I know that there are car sports fans in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, willing to invest in the creation of a Russian team called Formula One, he pointed out.
"We are prepared to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team also arose because Sochi had such an infrastructure."
Tomorrow, Sochi Autodrome is waiting for an ashlag.
According to Dmitri Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50,000 tickets.
Look, even at the rostrum's qualifications, the Vice-Premier pointed out.
I can tell you that this year's revenue has increased by 72 percent compared to last year.
It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian auto-sport enthusiasts were Daniel Quyat's return to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success in the next season," said the Vice-Premier to the Izves.
He's a very hopeful racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part at once in the "Formula-1" peloton.
Although the fate of Sergei Sorotkin in the Queen's Races remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he is ranked 18th in the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope there's more of our main pilots next season than this year, says Dmitri Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriaologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world glory and made him Nobel Laureate.
By the way, penicillin extraction from mold mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had planted a mucus from his nose on a petri dish (such a glass roof where bacteria were tested) and had discovered a few days later that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
They also found penicillin almost by accident.
Fleming's name was listed as the 100 most outstanding personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming came to the French capital shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "To defeat fascism and free France, he has done more than dozens of divisions."

Trump told me about the "love" in Kim Jong Eun.
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea almost fell in love with each other, joking about Donald Trump.
President Donald Trump of the United States made a good joke about his success on the front of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries now have a relationship so fixed that they are hardly in love with each other, the President of the United States has pointed out.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so much of a relationship with the DPRK that they couldn't even reach the country's leadership, they simply didn't pick up the phone.
At that time, the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "excellent letters" to the White House, marking Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, Kim Jong Eun was "brutal" as well, which was mutual.
But now their relationship is so strong that the leaders are "in love with each other".
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang and the closure of military sites.
All of this is the merit of his administration, I'm sure the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke on a flattering note of Kim Jong Eun from the rostrum of the UN Genassamble.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the Korean peninsula was fully denuclearized.

A positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile testing by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of America of the remains of American soldiers.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still baking.
The media reported that, after the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "Gangster".

Nice called for the "Moscown language to be replaced by Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and native-language activist Larissa Nitsoy called for the removal from Ukraine of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language".
To do so, she proposes a Ukrainian product, "cultural wave, cultural natty".
Nice shared her views on "the feasibility of eradicating Russian in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "The Monitor".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product was being prepared - it was already in existence and was continuing to evolve.
In time, the Ukrainians will recover from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian speech had been widely used on television and radio in the past, but there was hardly any in the public space.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian are, in her view, only "the widening of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Previously, Nice shared her experience of maintaining a "krynophone regime" in the Karpata children's camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons bookshops by a court, one of whom had spoken to her in Russian.
Nice threw change at the girl without getting her job done.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nice recently stated that the name "Russ" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not be avoided even by the Ukrainian Security Service: when she came there and heard staff talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left by slamming the door.
There was a man's conversation on the break, and it was bearing fruit.
He is the champion of the "Urala" by Denis Kulakov, the winner of the "Arsenal" (2:1) match for the ninth round of the Russian Championship.

"I think we wanted to win more," quoted Kulakov's official website, "Hurala."
"This complex game came out, and a serious male conversation took place during the break, and it yielded results: two balls were scored and no balls were missed.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you suffered at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it lasted 90 minutes, then it's okay!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end, a little bit of strength to keep things from happening.
So, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they thank you very much!
"What do you think of the team's atmosphere?"
"It's no secret that after winning and recovering is easier, and the mood in the group is good.
Now we've got a white stripe, though it was black first.
We need to keep this up and cheer the fans."
"Did you miss the game when you didn't go out to the field?"
"There's something I miss a little, 'cause it's really a bad situation.
But once again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors who were put on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
And the rest is secondary."

We call on citizens to abide by the law and to refrain from any disturbance of public order and calm and any violation of the secrecy of voting," said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The citizens of the Sunday referendum are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On 17 June, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, on the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia".

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, Russia's negative theme was virtually absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Konstantin Koschev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not exclude it from becoming a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric we have almost become accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been somewhat more muffled," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes "marked as one of the three main threats to humanity, but along with Ebola fever and climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this line, in any case, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which had been sufficiently unanimous in that regard".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that "the Russian theme was practically absent".
"If I look closely at the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Foreign Minister of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least there was no choir," drew the attention of the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall trained by the tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfed Committee of Specialists does not rule out that this indicates a trend which, in his view, "will single out the present session of the [UN Genassamble], although this trend may be fully apparent in a year's time, two or three."
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some sense be a turning point," admitted Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia has managed to move forward in international affairs with its involvement."
He cited the situations in Syria, Iran and North Korea as examples.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time," added a parliamentarian.
This is related to what he believes is the emergence of "an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - integral participant in solving the global problems of our time".
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going through a point somewhere that isn't going to be reversed, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachchev called "the demand for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Genassamble session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I have had my own meetings, and I am very pleased to see that, if a year or two or five years ago the Russian view, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, was largely uninterested, the situation is now different," said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to questions about how to deal with world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, migration".
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," he expressed Kosachev's confidence, stressing that he considered "the current session to be a good one for the Russian delegation, a good one for Russia".

In Damascus, they claimed their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem, stated.
However, he said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of the Russian-licensed organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reporting to RIA Newsti.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that negotiations with Kurdish SDF forces had been good until the US interrupted.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea youth team.
Previously, it was reported that a 37-year-old lawyer was negotiating a transition to Moscow's Spartacus.

The First Vice Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the Russian convicted prisoner for "spynament" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for having not yet managed to release him from prison.
She referred to this in a video message to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suschenko by the FSB.
According to her, an action was being carried out under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris during those days, during which participants had declared a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them are people who know you well, starve to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, no interviews where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, demanded pressure on the Kremlin, no pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and those illegal detainees in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would bind every Ukrainian, making us "a little more evil, harder to defend Ukraine's national interests, to protect every Ukrainian, to understand what good is and what evil is".
A reporter from Ucrinforma in France, Roman Sushchenko, was arrested by Russian security forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage with the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suschenko to 12 years in a strict-security colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia ruled the verdict to be lawful.
The Russian prison staff granted the Ukrainian's last request before his transfer to the colony.

Wahtang Kikabidze on cancer control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many sick people.
A famous actor, Vahtang Kiqabidze, admitted that he was only alive because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit in the skull with a hammer.
I fell.
I lost my orientation.
They put him in the hospital.
He couldn't hold a spoon, he couldn't stand, he fell all the time.
Started testing, turns out bad business, artery doesn't miss blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a big pussy cyst in my head, had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst," said Kikabidze in "Once Upon a Time."
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol at the door of his house.
But the actor's wife wouldn't let a live actor be buried, she believed she could handle the disease, and for over a year she hadn't left her beloved husband's bed.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock," the actor admitted.
The actor was able to cope with the disease, and he now lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.

The creators of the Peacemaker website included Peter Siyarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, in the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was "an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as of participation in "the organization of a provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian law by Ukrainian citizens".
Note that in front of Siyarto, the viceroy of Kievo-Peacher Lavra, Paul, and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriots), Onufriy, were pleased.
The reason was their opposition to receiving Tomos from the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatia, the President of Ukraine, Petr Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities named the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Vorones' deputy governor.
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of Voronezh province, Yuri Agibalov, was made under the Regional Law on Public Offices.
At the same time, the real amount of the "golden parachute" released from the post of a vrio civil servant was a few times less than the amount reported in the media.
The Regional Government Press Service provided such explanations.
According to the law, the salary for the holding of the post of Agibalov is 11,189 roubles.
As a result, the press service emphasized that the lump sum was 223,892 rubles less income tax, rather than the 1 million rubles reported by the media.
The official has been receiving an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
He has been in public office for more than nine years.
This pension and a lump sum are awarded to him immediately after his resignation and explained to RIA Novosti in the provincial government.
At the same time, the payment of pension supplements to Agibalov was suspended on appointment to public office, and his salary remained the same as in the previous period.
The vrio governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, who won the election, took office on 15 September.
Abibalov was released on the occasion of the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the authority of other officials who held public office in the region has come to an end.
On 29 September, Telegram Channel Nezighar published documents that showed that Abigailv, who had resigned from his position as Vice-Governor, had paid a severance pay of 23 salaries, and two days later he had again received a similar position without vrio.
A member of the State Duma called for students to be told about the harm of masturbation.
Onishchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
On the basis of his work experience, he noted in an interview that adolescents are being masturbated by the harmful information they find on the Internet.
This is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio "Moskwa":
As part of the overall sex education of children, this must be done by explaining the harm because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that children mature early enough, and then there are big scissors between their sexual maturity and the possibility of formal intersex contact.
According to Onishchenko, the problem has been hampered by "sanity", the silence of "sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are suffering from sneaking.
The deputy believes that it is primarily in schools in "hyperurbanized" regions to practice lessons about the harm of nanism.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we just won't be understood by you, to say the least," the professor said.

AdG was the second most popular in Germany.
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are dropping.
It appears that Germans have become very tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most recent social surveys show that the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling block Merkel and Zehofer are weakening.
This week, A.G. broke another record, rising to number two in the popular sympathy rating.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity managed to bypass social democrats, who have about 16%.
The one-per-cent gap could be written off as a statistical error, but one cannot fail to note the fact that the AdG created in 2013 from a small group of euroceptic economists has become a major political force.
The leadership in the overall set-off is still holding the CSS/CDS ruling block, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points, as early as April, support for Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans are in favour of Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that the social democrats were followed by green (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberal (10 per cent).
Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the Government, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including euro issues and EU cooperation.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's sponsorship of weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German stamp and the country's full withdrawal from the EU.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the policy platform of the AH has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the Euroskeptic niche and began to strongly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, AH managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens "a nation of fools".
Leading a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books by Ostep Drozdov on live television admitted to considering his compatriots to be "a nation of idiots".
They believe TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov pointed out, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Inanimate has begun to fight against literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities by banning the importation of 201 publications.

Canadians built a car in case of an apocalypse, a magazine behind the wheel.
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defense Solutions announced that it was already accepting applications for its new armoured vehicle.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armour
It's not just video game manufacturers, film studios, and book publishers who make money on the apocalypse theme.
Car companies are now developing a new niche.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions introduced its Apocalypse Apocalypse Senator APC.
In a fantasy-free time, the company's engineers build armoured vehicles for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not very comfortable but are completely safe to be placed in a whole-gear armor.
This bunker, otherwise you can't name the structure, because its reservation level is in line with B7 on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its head, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from rocket-propelled grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armoury Salon
In order to prevent passengers from being harmed by an explosive wave caused by an explosion near the vehicle, the car compartment is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For a safe view, the Roshel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a round-view camera system with a night vision function, as well as an armoured observation tower on the roof.
There's no weapons in the car.
Fore end of the Apocalypse Armoury Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that the gravity of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330 strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litres, the full power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-speed automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of being stuck at the Apocalypse Armoured Roshel Senator APC.
The Apocalypse Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC will be available at a specialized exhibition in Washington in October.
Time of Death of the Universe
The universe is another 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
A study of the international community of scientists is available in the ArXiv.org Library for publication in the Journal of Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The experts came to these conclusions by observing with HSC (Hyper Superime-Cam) the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the world under observation, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model of the CDM ( < \ > Cold Dark Matter > ), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that observations had provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of data from the European Planck Space Telescope had clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters .
In July, scientists modelled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments to the effect that the world under review would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unite the proponents of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to hear the people ' s opinion on pension reform is indefinitely postponed
In Moscow, a general federal initiative group was held on Saturday against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered the different wordings of the questions (five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Do you want the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension to be raised as of 1 July 2018?"
This formulation was registered by the Vlogodian subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally binding.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of Ilya Sviridov, a member of Justice Russia (six subgroups) and CLCF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Previously, Sviridov had said to the "Reports" that the invitations had been sent to all the organizers, and some 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Vologhodian sub-group (its wording was supported by 15 additional sub-groups), said to the "Vedotes" that the invitations had not been received and that she had not planned to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy."
A blues singer, Otis Rush, died.
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blues guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP, citing his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke suffered in 2003.

Admiral has caused us big problems.
Zinathula Billletdinov: Admiral has caused us great problems.
Zinathul Billletdin's chief coach, Ak Barsa, summarized the KHL regular championship against Admiral (4:2).
"It wasn't a simple game, it was complicated.
The rival fought with dignity, caused us great problems.
I'm glad we played pretty good today in most of us.
I've already told you that someday the goals will come, as long as we work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zarip a break in this series?"
"We have a program he's working on.
That's why the decision was made," quoted the club's Bailletdin press service.
Ilon Mask will leave the board of directors of Tesla.
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask will have to resign as chairman of Tesla's board of directors and pay a $20 million fine.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of CEO of the company, reporting to the AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Previously, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Ilon Mask - officials thought he misled Tesla's investors because the businessman had bought all of the company's shares at a high price - $420 a piece of paper.
In the Loko match, "Ahmat" Turbin's mistakes fell out of the horn of abundance.
Former Justice of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the arbitrator Evgeny Turbin in the ninth round of the Russian Championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and took out the controversial episodes of the game.
- What do you think of Eugenia Turbin's trial in the Locomotive match, Ahmat?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his inability to judge Russian Prime League matches.
I am surprised that the pressure of the fifth tour of Spartacus - Dynamo - neither Turbin nor the DSI leaders themselves - made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, and private omissions of gross methods were spilled out of the horn of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute of a railwayman named Eder, the Ahmat's advocate, Rodolfo, drops his hands in his parking lot.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't charge.
- How do you appreciate the episode of Idov, which was at 82 minutes when it seemed like the ball hit him in the arm?
- I believe there was a deliberate play by the lawyer's hand in his parking space.
Turbin was standing next to the moment, seeing the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This was also to be seen by reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three had slept through, and no penalty had been imposed.
The match was therefore distorted and sports justice was violated.
This was the case where the judgeship, by definition, replaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin refused to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who broke the rules in the fight against Crimea, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he gave him a show of applause.
What do you think of this episode?
You had to show me the other one?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card weren't exactly on file.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards in the judiciary that some teams are being punished for violations such as those in the episode with Idova and some not.
What do you value the words of a footballer?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to me.
So the arbitrator doesn't give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge watches who plays.
He played Locomotive on Saturday, and Ahmat has serious concerns about Turbin's work because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played a rape charge against Judge Cavanaugh at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new Saturday Night Live series on NBC.
In a small sketch, Cavanaugh played at the Senate rape hearing.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories in an interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but he said that he had never been drunk before.
Cavanaugh also claimed that he was a virgin in those years in an attempt to exonerate himself on the charge of rape.
Damon also beat those moments.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in Matt Damon's office.
Cavanaugh was previously elected Chief Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found strange behavior in her cloned dogs.
American singer Barbra Streisand stated that her dead dog's clones were completely different from the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clouds] look like her, but it's impossible to clone the soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones from her 14-year-old dog, a coton de tulear named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are involved in cloning a six-year-old animal in an effort to understand why it is so miniature.
The US has been thinking about Russia's naval blockade due to oil and gas supplies.
In the US, a naval blockade of Russia could be imposed to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities have fought so hard for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are prepared to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's major energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, described the possibility of a naval blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior did not perform police functions but carried out civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Zinke ' s statement was therefore entirely within the competence of his department, although political colour was not lacking.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinka stated that, thanks to the U.S. Navy, sea routes in the Middle East region were controlled and could block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive a lion ' s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow's revitalization in the region, I am sure Zinka.
The Minister has made it clear that the US still expects to lead the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington would have to take over Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, an acceptable measure along that path, considered Zinke.

The serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director-General of the Southern Cyril Sipalo Central Aerodynamic Institute said so.
He said that the Science Centre was working on supersonic topics, both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Ministry of Promtorg.

There's a club in Russia I'm watching.
Former captain of Chelsea and England's team, John Terry, about why he attended the ninth round of Russia's Spartacus Championship, "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I'm watching.
I was just following him, and I was interested in seeing him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have and want to apologize again for the decision," Terry quoted the Chelsea fan website.
Remember, "Rostov" with 18 points went to third place in the tournament table, and "Spartacus" placed on the fifth line with 15 points in its asset.
On the next round, the red and whites will play with Enisey on the 7th of October, while Valeria Carpin's wards will receive Orenburg the day before.
Dear violin went to the pawn shop for a price.
When a man brought a violin at the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in the city of Somerville (Massachusets), a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for an old and unpresented instrument.
But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked for advice from an expert.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Gallano and is estimated at $250,000.
The only links to the violin are estimated at $168,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from a resident of the city and that the instrument had been returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin hit the man who took it to the pawnshop, but no previous clashes with the law were recorded.
The manager says that now everyone taking the violin to the pawn shop will be asking to play it to make sure it really belongs to a client.
In the ninth round, we are facing an exciting standoff: Spartacus will receive a man at his stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valerie Carpin, who is known to be no stranger to the "people's team."
The special spicyness of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal score of 15 points, and they divide 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, behind the far-fetched Zenitha and in the same glass as the Reddar, who plays with Dynamo tomorrow.
The red-and-whites are now in a difficult situation: the club is surrounded by idiotic scandals again, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew into Rapida in the League of Europe, and recently gave up the Ahmata home.
After the derby with the CSA, which ended with a fair tie, Spartacus played with a minimum score and wasn't easy to beat in the Cup "Montenegro" and it's too early to say whether Russia's most popular club is approaching the end of the crisis.
"Rostov" couldn't win three games in a row, but he hasn't lost five games.
Let's see if Karpin can prolong the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Carpina Rostov with Spartacus ended in favor of the capital team.
Starting at 7:00.

London broke out with accusations against Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the cold war, and the British Secretary of Defense, Gavin Williamson, has said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and enemies are operating in grey zones with cyber attacks and false news, the Minister added.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have repeatedly been denied and transmitted to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, ex-Colonel GRU Sergei Scripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is under way to join the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a warm supporter of the Republic's renaming of Northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today ' s vote are monitored by international organizations.
The Head of the Monitoring Mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan psychist, presented Euronews on how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams travelled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to the closing of polling stations, to the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.

The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans.
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a major role in understanding.
On 30 September, on the International Day of Interpreters, Barbel Sachs, a professional synchronist translator, spoke about this.
For more than 30 years, she has been translating from Russian and English.
"The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "are long delayed and fast."
But I don't think that's a big deal for understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter," said the expert in RIA News.
According to the interpreter, in order to understand that the two countries need each other, "it is enough to know history".
And in the future, Saxe pointed out, Germany doesn't need to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, and there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, a lot of things that define our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that the country was trying to "get in touch" with and maintain Russia.
For Berlin, mania, she said, the Northern Flow 2 gas pipeline, which was being built from Russia's coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, was particularly important.

Vladimir Putin, by decree, released Alexander Manjosin from the post of Presidential Director of Foreign Policy.
In place of him is Igor of the Unbelievers.
Mr. Manjosin has been in charge of the Presidential Office for Foreign Policy since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure from the Kremlin, JO's close source cited personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantive claims in terms of quality of work to the head of management.
Igor Neverov previously headed the Second European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
From 2009 to 2014, he was the Russian ambassador to Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble to a low-wage deputy.
In Yekaterinburg, the Man Foundation launched a fund-raiser for a member of the State Duma, Vera Ganzi, who complained about low wages.
The campaign can be traced to the organization's website.
"The Man Foundation expresses the hope that we will be able to save the servant of the people.
We ask all concerned people to give life a chance and a happy future!
All raised funds will be handed over to the poor in person.
"Oh, God save you!" said the fund's message.
The charity wants to raise 380,000 rubles for the deputy, which is equal to a month's salary.
Reports of assistance received are published on the fund's VKontakta page, where the organizers post scripts of remittances.
The most frequent donations are one ruble and 50 cents.
At the time of publication, Russians had donated 1,633 roubles to Vera Ganze.
Fund-raising was opened on 28 September following Ganzi's low-income complaint.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy was 380,000 roubles, which left nothing to do, so it was necessary to spend on a credit card.
Ganzia complained that parliamentarians did not compensate for hospitality.
Subsequently, in the State Duma, they stated that they would consider the possibility of paying representation costs to the deputies.

The Night School comedy led the American boxing office.
The night school comedy debuted at American cinemas last Friday, making $28 million for its first weekend in a rental.
This resulted in an unintentional painting with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the lead roles leading the US box office from 28 to 30 September.
On the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the battle for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has outpaced another newcomer in the west, the "Smolfoot" cartoon, a curious history of familiarizing a charming yett with a human race whose existence the main hero never believed.
Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Raisig's project for their start-up weekend raised $23 million, largely meeting the expectations of experts who predicted a 20-25 million ribbon for the weekend.
With regard to Smolfute's total fees, to date, they amount to $38.6 million (and it has made its debut in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active one, adding 3.6 million to the film's coffers.
Three of the strongest this time locked up a children's fairy tale, "The Mystery of the Hour," by Eli Roth's horror master, who finally proved that the director was able to make a quality movie for a 12+ audience.
In her second week of renting, the filming of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total global fees to $53.8 million.
Despite the flight out of the top three, he continues to be surprised by the sign "+" trellaire with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, "Just Request": in 17 days in the United States, Paul Figg's painting, from which some unrealistic financial performance was initially not expected by the word "all", raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and now has an even 62.9 million total revenue.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Monk's curse chorr, raising $5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-off, "The spell" for 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas, has $330 million in total earnings, and has recently been proud to be the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two tapes about the creepy doll Annabel.
Right after Corinne Hardy's horror streak, another genre debutant of the Hallfest, one of the top youth chorrows of the year, was placed last weekend.
On his first weekend, Gregory Plotkina, who had previously worked in a number of large chororororor projects, including the Happy Day of Death, which Hallfest has a strong resemblance to places, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
Seven became the "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million) who seem not to be expected to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week is the sixth largest genre in history, with a total of 165.7 million genre ribbons.
This is the amount the picture has so far earned on the domestic market, with the total revenue of the tape amounting to $218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky guys on the top ten in the US in September 28-30, they were Predator, White Guy Rick, and... Bug Mint, who earned $3.7 million over the weekend, $2.38 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
Let's add that next weekend in the United States, we're gonna have the long-awaited "Ven" with Tom Hardy, who, without any doubt, will be taking over the leadership of the American box office at the end of the first weekend of October.
From the other premiere of the coming week, we should highlight the musical melodrama "Star Born", the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."

God helped Siberia today.
Valeria Belov's chief coach of "Viteza" is about a defeat from Siberia (3:4) in the regular KHL Championship.
"The College was talking about Siberia fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," quoted Belov's official website, "Vitya."
"I hope they'll support it, too, 'cause right now almost every game is full of stadiums, great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps God helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
Our leading leaders lost the game, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, even though there were moments.
But I'll still take the blame.
'Cause they must have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's a freaky thing to do."
The audience is outraged by Agoutin's choice of voice show.
The audience on Voice 60+ is accusing Leonid Agoutin's mentor of being "unbelievable and insolent."
When he first learned the voice of his father, Nikolai Agoutin, in a blind audition, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the son's feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to join his team.
At the time, many people thought it was a joke, but they forgave the mentor for being biased in the first step.
But the joke went on long enough, and the star's father has taken the place of more worthy performers without any justification.
And now the audience is no longer ready to forgive Agoutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, as the audience of the show, we were outraged by the freaky and frank drag of our close relatives to the final stairwell.
I had already doubted that Agoutin had the strength and the conscience not to drag his dad all the way to first place," Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larina discussed on TV Man.
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin leaked beautiful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining what the audience still wanted to see on his father's show.
But, as it turns out, it's not like that at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and they want to see really talented performers in the finals, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I'm sorry for the voices on the Agoutin team-- they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, he was supposed to be a professional today."
"The competition has lost its purpose."
"Delete two talented people from the project and leave your dad on the project who doesn't sing but whispers, what can you call a mentor after that?"
"I love the way Dad sings, "organize him at the Kremlin for your money and see how many people are coming to this concert."
It's a Voice show, not a Cool Relative show.
"It was unprofessional on the Agutain's side."
"Then you have to propose on your own show that you show to daddy, not a show that's being made for 1 Canal's money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the Surgut worker have a great voice and a tambra leaked, and Agutin's dad got to the finals?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and on screen for decades!
'Cause you can't get through the mess!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's blather and neatness all over the place.
And the money for the family budget isn't gonna be too much!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of traditional Voice, Gradsky's son appeared on blind auditions.
It never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Agutin couldn't do what a professional could.

The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the Russian expedition to the Moon.
The head of the Institute for Space Research of the RON, a correspondent member of RIA Anatoly Petrukovich, informed RIA Novosti about a possible research programme for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was currently working on the development of guidelines for such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, thereby avoiding the interference caused by the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," Petrokovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, the cosmonauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite, according to a scientist.
It might help to determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of Roskosmos said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation could fly to the Moon by 2030.

Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, who had a tooth at the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour network store: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
So I decided to take revenge on my enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went into the store and dumped the contents of the basket on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
There were feces and urine in the basket that Simms borrowed from a nearby mobile biotualate.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the "venger".
He was imprisoned and released on $300 bail pending trial.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of property and a criminal offence, and was not allowed to enter the store and approach the manager.
Although Simms's crime seems funny rather than serious, the sentence may be quite severe, as he has repeatedly violated the law: it is characterized by large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and animal abuse.

According to the press centre of the SBU, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been wanted by Interpol since 2014, for which reason he had been detained on Russian territory and handed over to him as a representative of an insurance company.
When crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fake license plates, but placed them again at the entrance to Kiev.

In the Minister ' s view, there are two options: military and economic.
It would prefer not to use the first one, so it was necessary to put pressure on and remove Iranian energy resources.

Sergei Silotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it hurt so much.
The Russian pilot "Williams" Sergei Sirotkin commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"I honestly don't want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between two cars that got me locked up right away.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
It was hoped that after the rest of us went to the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air, and we'd get back to speed, but the rubber was gone.
Plus he was fighting his partner, and he was in contact, too.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We were in a situation like this on the slowest track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more," quoted the words of the orphankin RIA News.
Let's recall that Sorotkin finished his 18th race at the Grand Prix of Russia, and the winner was the British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.

The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR), Shamil Tarpishchev, commented on the suspension of football players from Moscow's Spartacus, Denis Glušakov, and Andrei Spenko, from training with the main composition after liking to criticism by the Chief Coach of Massimo Carrera, reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to things like that.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the rift in the team.
First of all, they're poems, they can be read and understood as they please.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second of all, everyone wants a funeral.
Listening and Sponge's liking doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italians lack flexibility in understanding the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to be blown up at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus has a lot of problems on different lines, and there's a lack of coherence after the introduction into youth.
Relationships within the team do not seem to add optimism to this match," I'm sure Tarpishev.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30th and begin at 7:00 p.m. Moscow time.
John Terry, who refused Spartacus earlier, led Chelsea's youth team.
The students of Sirius discussed natural technologies with scientists.
The students of the Cirius Educational Centre in Sochi, who attended the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute".
A presentation by researchers took place as part of a programme of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on 29 September, on the website of the Education Centre.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Kurchatova Codes", in which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, a member of RAN, Mikhail Kowalchuk, spoke of global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is available on the Sirius website.
The students learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
Natural technologies, which young scientists are currently working on, will help solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum.
Kowalchuk also raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies and the inherent risks that such technologies pose.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, a great asset.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural-like technologies is actually a technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's a backside-- a deliberate interference in a person's life.
There's always a risk.
There was a car, and people were killed under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating medically new technology, but I can also create weapons of mass destruction," quote REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask the participants questions.
Speakers included Julia Diakov, a candidate for physico-mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-Nature-like technologies, the Kurchatov Institute, and Vyacheslav Demin, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS.
The Sirius Educational Centre in Sochi was established by the Talant and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further professional support gifted children at an early stage.
Previously, in September, it was reported that the prizes of the All-Russian Online Information Security Olympics Cyber Call would be sent to Sirius for training.

Kemerovian insulted the herd of the sheep in the cemetery.
On September 30, a well-known Kemerov page on the social network reported by an eyewitness that a local cemetery was freely rogued by horny animals.
The animals went between the fences and pulled out the grass.
Commentators expressed differing views: one of the local residents pointed out that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery and that their appetite might even help to clear the area of the weed and grass, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not like the behaviour of animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the lambs to do.
You can't say they're sacrilege, but that's not the case."
One way or another, one of the witnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Pull and pull, how is it right?
There is no word for pressure.
That's the right thing to do.
The word "squeezing" in the meaning of "truth, influence, influence" exists only in the context of the phony, because we hear the sound of [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfaction."
We use this word to believe it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfied" are not only not very close, but even in a way opposite.
Make sure you do.
It means "satisfying enough, full enough, enough, enough to be enough for someone or anything, to be satisfied."
Satisfied, pleasure is related.
He used to have the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a smug meaning" - "to please himself."
The old-fashioned "wealth" is related to the words "worship" and "wolf."
Pushing and suppressing are completely different.
These words have really scary "parents": daos is "wolves" (hungry sheep), deyja is "die" and dvaid's is "push."
The similar background of the words "pressure" and "satisfaction", as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to engage in a contaminating process.
So we've got this very "d" that's also used in the letter through "a", which, in good faith, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the creation and development of these words.
All right, that's good.
But that word is outdated, in its correct meaning, no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember, it's cancellitis.

It will be interesting to observe his performances next year," quoted the words of Alešin SMP Racing.

Refugees and migrants should not be considered different, and migration itself was the mother of that society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations had sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In three years, the Russian military operation in Syria has killed about 100,000 terrorists, of whom 85,000 have destroyed Russian air and space forces.
On the occasion of the third anniversary of the launch of the Russian military operation in Syria, Victor Bondarev, former head of the FAC, head of the committee of the Federation Defence and Security Council.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-borne weapons: the air-space forces had carried out and continued to carry out all attacks on terrorist targets precisely.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, reinforced areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the jihadist defence was hacked - a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government troops - by transmitting "Interfax".
At the same time, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has also protected Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IG, prohibited in Russia) and the "Jebhat al-Nusru" (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of the IG, there were about 4,000 Russian citizen fighters and about 5,000 citizens of the post-Council countries, and TASS is being handed over.
It was only the registered persons, not including those who had not been identified, who had stressed Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and prepared to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our territory freely.
So, Bondarev pointed out, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at far-off borders - otherwise this evil would "blow to us".
Boris Johnson's phones and a number of British ministers have been made publicly available.
The personal data of a number of former and current British ministers have been made publicly available due to the security failure of the app created by the Conservative Party, which transmits Sky News.
In particular, the telephone numbers of the Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond, and the former head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, were available.
According to the television channel, several politicians received "unpleasant calls."
The technical problem has been eliminated, and the application is now safe.
We study the causes of the malfunction and apologize for any problems caused," said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data but also edit information in profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Ecology and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his photograph was replaced by a picture of the media magnate Rupert Murdock.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian town of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted, and carried out massacres of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law," he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists" because the objectives of the militants and the Western Coalition in Syria coincided with and meant "the breeding of chaos, death and destruction in their path".
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over and that the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to clear Syria of its illegal foreign presence and that priority in rebuilding the country would be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for Reconciliation of Hostiles in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two United States F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with prohibited phosphorus munitions.
The U.S. denied all charges.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine is entitled to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The Head of State said that during his visit to Kharkiv province, commenting on Hungary ' s issuance of its passports to Zakarpatia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, as President, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the Ministry ' s position in the Hungarian passport scandal, which is intended to expel the consul of that country from the coast.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says," the President said.
According to FACTI, on 19 September, a video was released online recording the moment when Ukrainian citizens were issued with Hungarian passports at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they swore their allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, who appeared on a video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, had to leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Zakarpatsk Region had initiated criminal proceedings in connection with the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the heading "State treason".

Putin had already visited Hakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuwa, this republic is one of the President's favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
In Damascus ' s view, hostilities are nearing completion and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Muallem, said in the United Nations: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing its reconstruction efforts in the areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which had made life more difficult and deprived them of their means of subsistence.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate and provide funds for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that first and foremost a political solution to the conflict must be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted his guilt for diesel in January 2017.
Oliver Schmidt, one of the company's managers, was sentenced to seven years in prison last December.
The loss of the concentrate is estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.

Volkswagen is all over the place trying to make up for the losses and restore the client's trust.
For example, the management of the project has recently changed again, and a major restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: such power was granted in February this year.

Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UTC to fascist acts
The head of the synodal division of external church relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany, wearing a yellow spicy star on a Jew, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for that purpose that this bill was created," said the mitrol on the television channel Rossia 24 (quoted "Interfax").
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainen conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the PCA and to "legitimate it", the clergyman believes.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the church's believers consider themselves Ukrainians, they're patriots of their country," he added.
Previously, it had been reported that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada were working on bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the PTC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The viceroy of the Pochaevsian Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The viceroy of the Saint-Uspen Pochaeva Laura Mitropolita, Vladimir, made a call for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) believers was published on Saturday on the home site.
In different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives of faith and spirit, Christians had to practice their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation that has arisen, and according to the information we have, and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive," the mitropolitan said.
He asked for support -- prayerful, moral.
The lieutenant of the laura also stressed that it is likely that "your physical presence will be needed".
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in the spirit threatening to kill, so we will protect our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaeva Laura, the Orthodox Ukrainian and universal shrine, should be prepared to protect it, says the address.
Mitropolitanism has called on those who mislead believers not to do so.
The CPI has a canonal status as defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make the news Patriarch and a friend of the Roman Catholic Pope dependent on Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has," noted the viceroy of the laura.
He recalled that the CPI had been canonically independent and completely autonomous in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative or financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
"Tomos, what else do we need?" said the Mitropolit Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask if other religions of Tomos have any other faiths, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers have sort of figured out what temple they're going to.
Some, however, want to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envied by the envy of the dome on the temples they want to destroy," the clergyman stressed.
The Kachaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
There is a laur on the top of the Mount of Pocaev, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it dates back to the early 13th century.

The social lion published another sad post at Instagram, rather than pissing off her followers.
"I never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life still keeps teaching me... and when I'm about to start knowing people, " Buzova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to the post and noted that the singer "have not seen the real life".
"You're the one who hasn't suffered yet.
You stick to every word, live in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliamama37.
There were others who advised Buzova to approach psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Maybe you should read some literature on psychology.
What do you do to avoid being a victim?" wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were others who supported the singer.
"Ola, don't be upset.
Your man won't speak loud words all over the country and then just don't do them," supported Buzova @arina_prostyle.

Keep your nose up and go on," wrote @kreszentia_f.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and to give up Buzova because the singer was not sympathetic to him.
He decided to put all his money on charity.
If we keep playing the right game, the wins will come.
The main coach of Moscow's Dynamo, Vladimir Vorobiev, was about the defeat of the Autobilist (0:1) in the regular KHL Championship.
"Good game was interesting, even though it was walking up to the goal," quoted Sporojev's official website, Autobilyst.
"We used to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
Didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent had a bit of a problem with us, and we survived.
But we got a little "fed" removed.
The guys played great, they did a trainer's setup.
I think if we keep playing the right game, we're gonna win.
They didn't score, zero heads don't win, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"Do you think Autobilyst added to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign link.
At the pre-season, the teams performed other tasks, and there were a lot of young guys playing.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
Autobilyst is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but they didn't."

Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, "The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitskoski, stated that he would not vote in the referendum.
As the party's spokesperson, Naum Stoilkovski, explained, Mitskoski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with a treaty that considered it "bad".
According to the Spokesperson, the current referendum is about renaming the country and nothing more, while the party ' s strategic goal is NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, President George Ivanov of Macedonia refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in the independence referendum, and the Macedonian leader considered the country's renaming to be a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign State with a new name is being created," said Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year at a solemn ceremony on the bank of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to NATO and the EU, remind TASS.

However, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that only two Czech tourists had been injured.
According to Dypnoty, the injured woman has 35 percent of the body burns, 15 percent of the male burns, writes RIA News.

The United States is pleased with the increase in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The sharp increase in the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was widely discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have launched a genuine terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record year in the number of bloody attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," noted Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles did not begin yesterday.
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Within a month, America and NATO allies launched a military operation there, "Destructive Freedom".
It's been 17 years.
The thousands of American troops are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghastly than it was then.
U.S. troops are trapped behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they're paying off fighters for money, so they don't get hurt.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller proportion of the country ' s territory - 40 per cent, according to Patrushev.
50 per cent for the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10 per cent is for ISIL terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The goal of creating a barbaric pseudochalyphate in Central Asia is exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
It is also encouraging that the production of narcotic drugs ( opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40fold in 17 years of American presence.
The growth of opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits has been enormous.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum for EU and NATO membership, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour the right to be called Macedonia, seeing an assassination attempt on the same name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Blessing this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is entitled to a better future, a hope of social change.
And Greece will assert the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot bring happiness to all."
The ruling social democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favour of renaming the country.
It's against the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Florin Chilmanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "A lot of those who don't like the agreement think that the present socialist government, led by Zaev, is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain a sovereign country in the Balkans."
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole."
