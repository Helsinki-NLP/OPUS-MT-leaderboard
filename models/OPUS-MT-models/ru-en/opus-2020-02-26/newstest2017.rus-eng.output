28-year-old chef found dead at the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "He's finally on his way."
- The body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco citizen Frank Galicia, reported to the San Francisco Forensic Office.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told KGO's ABC television and radio company in San Francisco that Frank, a former supply line cook in Boston, had his job as a dream cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were "shot and depressed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss him very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying in hostels at first, but lately, "He's had a good time."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Louis Galicia said KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family was always to make us some food, to make us dinner," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who sailed along the current.
"With all the bad things that happen to this world, he was the unshot diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone in possession of information is requested to call Hotline SFPD at 415-575-4444.

He explained that, in the closed consultations of Sovbeza, he had provided Member States with information on incidents on the territory of the Republic of Crimea and had read a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation "expressing concern and outrage at the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage on the territory of the Republic of Crimea".

Italy ' s public debt has risen to record figures
Italy ' s public debt in June 2016 exceeded 2,248 trillion euros.
At the central bank, the country stated that this amount was the historical maximum and was transferred to RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
Then the government's debt reached 2,228 trillion euros.
It is noted that Italy ' s debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros during the first half of the year.
It was previously reported that Italy ' s public debt stood at 132.7 per cent of its GDP at the end of 2015.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, predicted a decline in the figure to 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
Payment from the airport was received by 141 victims of the Domodedovo attack.
One hundred and forty-one people received charitable payments from the Aviation Foundation, which was set up by the management of Domodedovo Airport to assist victims of the 2011 terrorist attack, reports Interfax.
According to the spokesperson for Alexander Vlasova Airport, two more statements are under consideration.
"The fund continues to provide charitable assistance to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides comprehensive assistance in resolving the issues," Vlasov added, recalling that a fund site with full information on how to provide charitable assistance had been set up specifically to facilitate interaction with victims.
In 2011, an explosive device exploded in the landing room of foreign airlines Domodedovo.
Thirty-seven people were killed in the attack and 172 others were injured.
Scientists found an animal that could live for 500 years.
An international group of biologists has concluded that the most long-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandian polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystal of 28 Greenland sharks' eyes.
The largest shark with a length of more than 5 metres can range from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in shark longevity, leading to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach puberty by only 150 years of age.
Previously, it was thought that the neighboring shark, a Greenland whale, lived longer than any vertebrate animal.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years of age.
Putin changed the composition of the Russian Sovbeza.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, by decree, changed the composition of the Russian Security Council and informed the Kremlin press service.
It was previously reported that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff and that Anton Weino had been appointed as his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as the President ' s Special Representative for the Environment, Ecology and Transport.
From among the permanent members of the Security Council, the Russian Federation has excluded the Council's undersecretaries Rashid Nurgaliev.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vineau, half-pre-president of the SFO, Sergei Moylo, and half-presidency of the SDF, Nikolai Zukanov.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of his position as Chief Executive Officer of the Presidential Office.
President Sergei Ivanov's decree removed the head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for environmental, environmental and transport activities.
Anton Weino, formerly Deputy Sergei Ivanov, has been appointed as the new Chief of Administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to move to another job.
Should we go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the Olga Bogush sanatorium.
And if a man is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need sanitary resorts not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and obtain advice from a doctor on how to live his life so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations would not be superfluous.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it shouldn't be brushed away.
Persistent stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% of visitors.
People from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are most affected.
So it's best not to complicate things and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people lower their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfort to the whole family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
Children, even the youngest, are provided with health-care programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatrics, testing and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children ' s pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and therapeutic exercise.
The course of procedure determines the doctor according to the individual statement and the characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, children ' s clubs with animators generally operate in sanatoriums, where children can attend play classes and various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with babies, provide the necessary facilities for the breasts, and provide an experienced nanny.
The soft winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round rest at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Water.
And then the body needs more than just summer rest.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are done in the room and don't depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, the treatment mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuqui, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects various systems of the body.
The water varies in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's health.
For example, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating effect, re-establishing the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
The Essentukey Four affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers the sugar level.
Essentucky's new has an anti-inflammatory, gillish and urinary effect.
The water of Slavinovsky also has the same effects.
The condition of the circulatory system must be taken into account by a doctor when appointing water.
If there are signs of hypertension, he picks up less salty water because salts delay fluid, which leads to increased pressure.
The intake of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, at the appropriate quantity and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the person and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of rehabilitation based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus can be obtained from resorts in the region?
In the vicinity of Fiveigorsk, for example, there is a salty lake of Tambukan, which has tin mud that is useful for joints, spinal cords, and internal organs.
It carries out an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immuno-immunizing act.
These are health walks along individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge spa park (the second largest in Europe).
It is popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the Narzan mineral source.
You can also take wine, pearls, iodine, selenium, sage, and cranky baths, depending on what the doctor appoints you.
Let's extend the fertility.
What can we do to make the harvest go through the season?
Says Julia Belopukhov, agronomist and daughter.
It's time for the tall tomatoes to have a haircut: remove the new stepson, cut the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruit, and the flower with the small tie, they won't be able to grow.
All tomatoes, regardless of "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with a salt-super phosphate extract, processed by bio-preparates (Prospector - to accelerate the filling and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from disease, Immunocytophyt - to increase immunity, Bioxybacillin, Lepidicide, Phytowerm - if there are pests).
Only copper coporos, colloid sulphur, and green soap should be used in chemical products at the end of the summer.
Let's do the last of the plants.
The long-leaf cucumbers in the greenhouse are attached from the scalar in such a way that the lower, naked part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, waters the warm water and the Circon solution, and puts the stem to sleep between 5 and 7 cm compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruit production of the courgette: cut off the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of integrated fertilizer, and put the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect you from the colds of the night, set up an arc with hidden material above the bed.
Keep the plants open by day, and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia coming out of the longest recession in 20 years.
According to the Bloomberg analysts interviewed, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend: in the second quarter of GDP, it fell by 0.8 per cent in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to recent Rosstat data, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The Stabilisation of the situation was also recently announced by Central Bank and Mineconom Development.
Slow growth ahead.
In the opinion of the CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is behind us and the economy is slowly growing ahead," says the Bank of Russia's bulletin, "What Trends Talk About."
The unit estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been raised to 0.4 per cent by regulators, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the Russian Federation ' s GDP declined in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified decline in GDP was 0.2 per cent by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15," quoted the representative of RIA News.
The slowing down of the Russian economy during the last five quarters indicates that the "day is over".
Among other markers indicating signs of a recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg calls for increased demand for electricity and rail transport, and a revitalization of business.
If we correct that the year is leapy, then it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half as a result of extra working hours.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight traffic, but it's hard to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the six-month volume can also be explained by seasonality," Cyril Yakovenko from ALOR BROTER explains.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
Looking at the course of the ruble, which, while showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year in August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that the real sector of the economy should follow," Yakovenko points out.
In addition, there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation since April.
In June, the rate rose by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.4 per cent, also showed positive developments.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent) below.
Despite the favourable situation in the labour market, the real disposable income of the population was not as good as it should be.
The annual rate decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder economic recovery, as household expenditures contribute significantly to GDP.
In general, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia ' s strict policy may also be cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5 per cent, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
Lack of investment was also a negative factor, which hampered the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," says the analyst of the GC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so developed in summer sports.
In the Rio Olympic Games, former foreigners speak for Russia, but in most cases they are natives of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
At the same time, in Rio, we can see a reverse process: quite a number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality varies.
Some parents took someone to another country when they were little, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't compete for a seat on the Russian team.
And someone thought that a better environment would be created abroad for the development of sport.
Aife.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport says a 27-year-old girl's name is Lisa Red.
But earlier, she was Elizabeth, of course.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to pursue a light athlete.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump six.
If she stayed in Russia, I don't think Elena Isinbaev would be able to "get off the throne."
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only countryboy, even if she was, in the jumping sector with the sixth.
Her best achievements in this sport are the 2010 European Championship bronze and the silver continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
She was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious preachers of the evangelical direction.
Because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight children in the family.
They all lived in a small town called Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting back at school.
After showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued to study at the U.S. Training Centre under the leadership of another former Russian man, Vladislav Izbojnikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup that same year, it's a win.
Before that, she was able to win silver at the 2010 World Championship.
Since then, there have been bronzes in 2013 and silver in 2014.
Mary, 26, was born in the city of Jaroslavle, where she first met the synchronous swimming.
But saying that our coaches raised her in Russia wouldn't be right.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
She soon joined the United States team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America it is a ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Shaldybina at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue her education in art gymnastics across the ocean.
Until then, the girl had a favorite sport in her native Jaroslavla.
After she emigrated to the United States, she quickly joined the country's junior team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She certainly didn't have to fight for the first time on the world stage, but for the US, she set up a real breakthrough -- she took out a star-and-field team at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Another of our former artists is Jana Beresko-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospect of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It's true that Ian was only able to take 17 places, not enough to get into the finals of the personal championship.
Two years earlier, however, she had managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, a young man's medal.
Another gymnast, only this time sportsman, Irina Sazonova.
While the emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she became the country's champion.
True, Ira's training is still in Russia - he comes to his home country on purpose to keep up his skill.
In Rio, she didn't do as well as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in a personal row.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkovoy in the Russian information space.
Mary has lived and trained in Switzerland for a very long time.
For a long time, however, it had been flying the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record at 200 metres of trampoline.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4×100 complex relay.
In order to get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfanding project that helped to raise some 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batyrov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hasawrt's native was a three-time champion of European championships, a Russian champion, and a master of international sports in Russia.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the gymnasium.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batyrov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-rossyanin, Michael Kudinov, is even less known in his home country than even the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was his 40th place on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her simultaneous swimming activities, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl was ranked sixth in synchronous swimming.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Crouter stands for Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitri became the country's champion.
He won the World Youth Championships that same year.
A year later, Croyter also wins the gold of the Singapore Youth Olympics.
In addition to jumping up high, Dmitri does a long jump and a triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another Hasawurt native who, after a long campaign for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he promoted the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports, even becoming the country ' s champion in 2011.
Oleg Antonov, 28 years old, was born in Moscow as a family member of the USSR volleyball team, Jaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before his son was born, Jaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family stayed permanently.
In 2015, he joined the national team as the bronze winner of the European Championships held on the territory of his new home country.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was caught with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was the original target, but it was not possible to enter that northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to study the free struggle.
He soon won the world's highest ranks among juniors and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the competition.
Once again, free struggle, and again, ex-Russian.
This time, it will be about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain, the Taymuraz of Freek.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the country ' s national team.
Before that, it was true that a 30-year-old athlete had a high performance in Russia as well.
He became the bronze winner of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The code of non-recruitment, Tymuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in Dagestan Mahachkale, the capital, Arthur Byarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has become Canada's champion three times, and in 2012 he became a world champion among young people.
In 2015, Byarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new home country since 1975.

Why are kids in Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, "it's not stocks and parades that need to be raised, it's systemic."
They must grow up and realize from at least seven years of age that they must be cossacks and education.
But so far, it seems to me that this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes bring together all the positive things that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I would be happy.
If everyone's excited and unknowing, the new idea will turn out to be a cheap populism.
LHC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is a violation of funds allocated to public utilities from different levels of budgets.
According to the Attorney General ' s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of HKK.
As a result, energy consumers in the region overpaid more than 170 million roubles.
Recently, the Prosecutor ' s Office of the Krasnodar Region found that unnecessary costs had been included in the tariffs.
And IW Consulting (cold water) was charged 4 million roubles for rental of cars at a higher price than the market.
And there's a lot of such examples across the country.
According to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund that was responsible for the renovation of urban facilities, Makarov had contracts with entrepreneurs, which were not actually executed but were paid for.
Businessmen were just giving him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the PC, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and the tenants is millions of rubles.
Makarov's scheme of schemes is, alas, typical of Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who had embezzled citizens ' money.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, also a former member of the Council, who has been accused of cheating 91.7 million roubles, is ongoing.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established six company managers and three limited liability societies in Elyzovo Kamchat province.
One of them was contracted by the CC, while the other two played the role of clearing house, i.e. receiving money from the population.
However, by energy, A. Kohan did not transfer funds, but spent on himself, the loved one.
It's hard to sue in the LKH area.
Cases don't get filed, they get delayed.
And "helps" in this highly complicated housing legislation," Svetlana Razvernev, Executive Director of the PNC, HQ Control.
We don't have time to make one law, like we're making up a new one that's supposed to make the previous one work.
There are also few professionals, including judges, on LAC issues.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in higher education institutions.
The Office of the Attorney-General also refers to refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and to the conduct of investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes under investigation in 2015, less than half were referred to the courts.
The rest of the investigation was protracted and one in five suspended owing to the failure to identify the accused.
The shortcomings of law enforcement agencies are often addressed by them to gaps in existing legislation.
The law is in place, but the investigative authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, with only 60 prosecutions.
Over the five months of this year, the number has increased only slightly, to 99.
What's falsifying the minutes of the tenants meeting?
This means that the change of management of the house, financial and other matters go against the views of the owners.
It also means that the market for housing and public services cannot be reached by normal companies that want to work honestly, not "destroy" the population.
So the tenants are in the minus, the small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the State, I am sure Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Matters.
This work is now well under way.
These are not just isolated actions, but are targeted against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
Especially in the capital, it doesn't smell like scandal.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the area of LHC, as in many other regions?
Because the capital government showed iron will and order, Anatoli, a member of the State Duma's Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AIF.
I am referring both to the personnel issue, to legislative amendments, and to legal education.
The managers of companies are subject to close supervision and all have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are dealt with quickly in the public space (and residents ' appeals and responses are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many people do not just pay for monthly receipts, but they keep an eye on what the house says.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs on housing and public services, because a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
That's probably all together, which explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the uninvolved should change their place of work.
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkey's president, Recep Tayip Erdogan, put forward the U.S. ultimatum, proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He spoke to his supporters in Ankara about this.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support for the "terrorist organization of the fathullahists".
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US is called upon to change its position.
Experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.
Either the organizing coups of FETO or democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," quote Anatoli Agency, Erdoğan's address in Ankara on Wednesday night.
The President of Turkey once again, but even more severely, demanded that the US comply with his demand, which he first made when the rebellion was repressed.
It will be recalled that on the night of 16 July, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in Turkey, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Recep Erdoğan addressed the population, the rebellion was repressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, some 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, they were mentored by Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the coup might involve Americans directly.
The United States of America denied all its claims by refusing to extradite Gülen and recommending a change of tone.
The last statement made by the representatives of the State Department on this subject was made at the time of Erdoğan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey from insisting on his own and also demands on other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil her obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels sets a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens", announced on 9 August by the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelick.
He said that Ankara ' s amendment of the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
On 1 August, Vice-Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words responded to the relevant statement of the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Mevluth Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu was made on the past Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it received the support it expected.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign States in the defence field — they import missiles," said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to build its own defence system on the basis of its own technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others," the Minister said.
The experts believe that this reflects Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and the country ' s shift to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Science, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go into a violent confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West and business, and from the military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance his relationship with the West by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient man in this position," the expert Aife.ru explained.
He said that, following statements by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for a visaless space with Europe, and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he might be under pressure.
"Recept Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," Minchenko says.
The head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexei Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view with Russia as soon as he benefits.
Eight months ago, Erdoğan took an extremely tough stand against Russia and sought favor in every way in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after some time.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
When he is between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to obtain the maximum benefit for himself," Muhin believes.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and it is for that to happen that he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US support for Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey," the expert believes.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasova, has a different view.
Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policies that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis will worsen in relations, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have stated that they are prepared to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, to settle relations with Israel, to engage actively in political interaction with Iran," Aife.ru Glasova explained that Erdogan's next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
She said that Erdoğan ' s current policy was a return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in terms of "zero problems with its neighbours".
Turkey's President's visits to Russia and Africa have now been very successful.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and strengthen Turkey's position in both the regional and international arenas," the expert believes.
The eye thinks that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, but the question now is whether the EU will respond harshly to Turkey, which can open its borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
A strike by junior doctors: Call for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the union to authorize further collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full board to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract negotiated with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Helen McCort said that the government continued to keep quiet about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "In view of the prevailing situation, the JDC leader voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for a formal re-negotiation of all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, JDC's leader today made a formal request to the BMA Council Extraordinary Assembly to approve a continuous programme to expand collective protests, starting in early September.
The dispute led to young doctors participating in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA's junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the contract, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to take during the pre-voting meetings of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of the Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to the gilded palace hall in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed tight, and he hardly had the heat even according to his own discreet standards.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, in contrast, has repeatedly referred to his "dear friend" Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the prolonged chill from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that moment was violent.
Mr. Putin sprung up an angry tirate, accusing Ankara of kicking Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on a supposed friend.
Restoring real confidence will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media have carried out a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be held responsible for everything.
The most serious allegations were made by senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But St. Petersburg has received an official signal that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he requested from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring in several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're peaking at the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, State television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"Turists over there, tomatoes back here," according to the report in the Vedomia newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil to the West for what she considers to be a weak response to an attempted coup.
Add to this her long-standing displeasure with the turtle's talk of joining the EU and Mr. Putin's move to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.
Bear in mind, this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this shiny palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as the "alyans of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps it is self-explanatory that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, when the two Presidents gave a press conference, they did not even address the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member, Turkey hit a Russian fighter jet — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-up role, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told Scotland's BBC that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to the World Cup champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a client and employee tour in Invernessshire.
He said to the BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be busy, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"This is a good time for us to move a brand bank, because we asked ourselves how we focus on improving the bank for clients?" said the CEO.
It'd be very cynical three years ago if we said we were gonna be a great bank for clients and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a New Market victory on the Predatory.
The baby's splashing champagne after taking a shot at New Market leads him to 3,000 wins.
Frankie Dettory's Jockey won his 3,000-British victory at New Market on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with his second winner of the night on his home track, the Pride trained by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who has reached this outstanding point in a smooth race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
The three-time Dettory jockey champion who had previously won Ghyyar said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm really glad it happened in New Market, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very uncooperative.
Children accept applause when they bring Predisposition after victory
The two jockeys reached their peak in the race with obstacles: Richard Johnson, the jockey champion, and Sir Anthony McCoy, a retired 20-time champion, who had more than 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, Derby's nine-time winner, 4493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this point, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical sage that separates him from others in the weight room.
He's a great racer, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big race!
Seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners in the UK for the most part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a vibrant character, which is good for British races, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettorie celebrated this remarkable mark by a brand-new fast jumping horse.
From fast finishes to fast jumps, Frankie Dettory is a symbol of British smooth races for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big race, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed great willpower to challenge skeptics and return to shape.
And he may not have finished for a while, but Dettori said earlier that he wanted to continue to compete until he was at least 50 years old.
Putin's firing Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's trusted close circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed Environment and Transport Representative.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President," but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov ' s deputy has been appointed to succeed him since 2012, Anton Weino.
Mr. Wino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IMIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the Office of the President ' s Protocol and the Office of the Government, reporting on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task for the administration is to support your activities as head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release and recommended that Vino replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
It's a move that's perplexed Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on State television, both men stated that the Chief Executive had resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it did not convince anyone here — especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So these are the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that a man who had once been campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy — was met with great scepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this very difficult position, even a problematic position, for four years.
Well, I guess I was head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putin's second term, because Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, took over the post.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson's star in Criminal Minds is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was in a fight on a show in L.A. last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on the scene and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that monitors the FBI's team of agents is expected to follow later, according to ABS Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor who previously played the lead role in the Darma and Greg sitcom has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I like to think like a criminal and put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but it won't be possible now.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sandstones left by a water twilight.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted the scene to Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the arrival of two-inch fish.
The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The 1.35 billion pound project now has to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers connected the northern passage and the Viaduk Quinsferry Crossing, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the paintings that are now approaching completion near all three pills of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge Section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The economic minister, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to engineering art on a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the Viaduk and the bridge painting is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of all the bridge paintings are now in place, and for the last section, concrete coatings are being poured into Rosty today, which means that all the paintings are ready to rise on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first connection on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this incredible project, this linkage is the most modern building art.
Once the last section of the road was installed and connected to the expanding North Pylon roadwork, we were left to close the remaining gap on the north — or toward the shore — side.
This was done by pulling up the northward Viaduk 700 millimeters south.
It was a massive but also very elegant operation.
Large, because the Viaduk is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to about 3%.
Beautiful, because the tolerances that the team was working on were tiny — only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it went very well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men lucky to be alive.
Three men were lucky to be alive after they were thrown off a fishing boat in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 1:20 p.m. British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfr.
Three men tried their best to travel to a safe place while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship circling next to them and assuming the worst," said Moelfre's lifeboat, Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we got to the water, the strong wind had taken him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, while a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and caught in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were taken aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men thrown into the water are lucky they're alive and completely unharmed.
The boat engine had an emergency defrosting device, but somehow it got away from the man who was driving the boat when it fell over.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching the screens, has been a complaint to many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go pulls people away from the couch and gets involved in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games, and lately smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the obsession that Pokémon Go is, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (subsequently producing a series of cartoons, play cards and other parts).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this became obsolete a few times before this new game became available in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed at that time due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, players with smartphones go looking for Pokemons that are tracked on GPS and, when found, can be photographed (through a screen shot on your phone) or caught.
The generation that played the game when it was younger joined in the festivities, breaking away from the sofas to search for it.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a "normal" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people being tracked, who performed 30 minutes daily, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it's just seeing the initial levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not responded because most health messages are boring and spoken by people who seem unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who engage regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she takes people out to do what they love.
Thus, three health pillars are covered: motion, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring pricks looking for something to complain about.
And, yeah, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
There's been a break.
Because despite the fact that smartphone applications like Fitbit could previously track our physical activity, they didn't give us the reason to do what this game gives us.
The new one will come, and the use will weaken over time.
But the success of Pokemon will produce more games that combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Beyles wins the gold of absolute female gymnastics.
Forget the blood pressure.
Forget the mess.
Simone Beyles is invincible for all of this.
It's dynamic on the back jump.
Unforced on a log.
It's stunning on the floor.
Amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well away from the silver medallist and teammate Eli Riceman of the Final Five and the Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafana.
The Biles from the United States performed at the gymnastics log during the final of the individual female absolute championship in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Beyles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the championship of absolute championship and fifth in general, consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she showed her final overall score and her long journey was over by now.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Beyles has spent the past three years dominated by sport, winning 15 medals of the World Cup - including 10 gold medals - with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between Beyles and the others in this field, but between it and a load of over-expected expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an untruthful expectation.
Simone Beyles of the United States, on the left, and Eli Riceman, hug after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Beyles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karoli's farewell party.
While Beyles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, she wasn't.
Part of her free exercise program, the one that includes her signature passage, is set up on Latin American music that would go just like houses on the street right outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a child and opened by Coach Aimee Burman's mother during her visit to the room where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single competition since the summer of 2013, which should last as long as Beyles wants.
Although Mustafa was given a small advantage by two rotations, it was a mirage.
Hymnastic logs and voluntariness — where Beyles defends the title of World Champion — are ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.43 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Riesman hugged her gently while they were waiting for the final score — a clean formality — and tears appeared around a brilliant red with white and blue eyebrows, when the design she had once recorded in her cut-off album came true.
Riceman's performance was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she divided third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafana on a tai-bracket.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team called "grandmother" was far ahead.
She would send kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, encircled by return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
With regard to Beyles, the viral tweet 19-year-old from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack on Phoenix's first serial killer in a decade sat in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, claiming to be the authorities.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight shots from a pistol standing on the passenger side of the car, then fled on another vehicle, and the report reports.
The police claim that the triple homicide does not appear to be the result of the robbery, as the intruder did not take the wallets or $2,900 that were at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted investigators to verify whether he had been involved in four previous attacks.
Only seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a branch of CBS, early this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan late 1990s, the black BMW late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lyner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup truck 30 minutes before the triple murder and was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and recovered the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "Better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivoto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephalus, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivo didn't know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
What really isn't true -- of course you're signing up for it, she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people did it yet," Pixivoto explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he turned three, and he's still not talking.
But it's going through some stages slowly.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth's showing the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can arise from a variety of different circumstances: genetic infections such as Edmund during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Pixivoto remembers the emotional loss of an uncertain future.
Did I always tell you what would happen?
What's gonna happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for mothers of babies with congenital defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, floods cause rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday inclusive.
The numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi have left the coast and threaten widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were received for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said it was only Tangipahoa that asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The danger of flooding remains until Saturday in much of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in the statement that an extra three to five inches could come to the area.
In southern Alabama, the waiting period for the flood was until Friday, as the rain continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton-Ruge and the Amit River near Deny Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a flood level record for the past weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Ruž.
He also said that the flood downstream in the Assenschen parish was a threat, as these rising rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The River Tikfo, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the flood in Amit and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi State.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepdaughter were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually over 400 feet from his house, quickly rose overnight.
He said that another stepdaughter who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford it was the largest tributary she'd seen in 48 years that she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the rescue workers rescued all three of them with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is "rapidly spreading," as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from the Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in the Tangipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, according to the authorities.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reports that counselor Tanjipahoa spoke about 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both flooding now.
The chairman of the parish, Robbie Miller, stated that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets in high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the parish of Tangipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sandbags were available for delivery to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Rupert Lacey, Head of Emergency Services, reported that the cover rain continued on the Gulf coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Tawson said, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "shot-shot" remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
Grandma and Grandpa identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was ripped by bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in hospital in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men is said to be in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car near a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
Semi-automatic weapons casings attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons were attached to the location.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," reported the station to police captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and the police are reported to be searching surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for a few reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Beyles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Riceman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American presence of women at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, African-American female gymnast number one has been.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America was very pleased.
The world could now witness the incredible performances of the three-time World Championship Simone Beyles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected yet virtual gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold in a woman's personal absolute championship.
And Eli Riceman's teammate earned silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like that in gymnastics sections all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's coachship.
But in reality, gymnastics is expensive sport, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents, paying for tuition, equipment, travel, uniforms, competitive contributions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's an expensive and long-term responsibility for gymnast families.
Aimee Burman, Coach Simone Beyles, and Maggie Hani, Coach Lori Hernández, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have already provided free and affordable gymnastics classes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand in Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to be able to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline, and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, school success, and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls into gymnastics, and that's great.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this serious demonstration by the Women's Force to win Olympic team gold and to motivate so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors took up the announcement of further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer.
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted had rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying that NHS was on "no one's land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors were transferred to a new contract, which included changes in night and weekend work to improve out-of-hour services.
Dr. Hélène McCott, chairman of the committee of young doctors, BMA, said in a statement last night: "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that he will fuel the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA's attempt to resolve the dispute in negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction, and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not do so, the junior doctors are clear that they are willing to organize further strikes.
The last drink at the end of April delayed some 13,000 planned surgeries and 100,000 nursing appointments, while nurses and consultants were hired to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing on a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better holidays for 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said, "Stayings reach little or nothing, but put pressure on already-working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Junior Medical Officers Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The employees hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after a break in their careers, the cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine — was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to comply with the conditions reached by VMA in November, February and May.
A drug for £2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with heart attacks are going to use the drug for £2 a day, after the authorities have recommended that more people be given it for a longer time.
The anti-deploying drug Takgralar reduces the risk of repeated seizures for people with heart disease.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another stroke.
The UK National Health Service (NICE) Supervisory Service advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the National Health Service of the United Kingdom has now advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people in England have a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them have another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of arteries and the formation of plaque.
If the pancake breaks apart, it can cause a clot to block blood access to the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can travel through the flow of blood and block the blood flow to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticcallor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilige, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of Takgralar for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the existence of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of the people who have already had a heart attack have had another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that tickerlor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased to have the opportunity to expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the tickerlor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
The culture of PC ownership allows the falsification of votes to flourish in Muslim areas
Ex-Mayor Tower Hamlets Lutfour Rahman was removed from office last year because of corruption, serving as a trigger for the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the destructive government report released today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former Cabinet Minister, has come under criticism of the police, election observers and city administrators for ignoring evidence of election irregularities due to "excessive sensitivity about race and religion".
A former community secretary, now an anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, voters should simply indicate their name and address.
The report even suggests that ink should be worn on people's fingers when they hand in their ballots, in order to exclude anyone from voting twice.
We need to give better protection to the informants, Sir Eric said.
He called for more access to the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a vote scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office because of a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, had "led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes cast doubt or were the result of a person voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concerns about mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clear the voting system, including a requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: "There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of seniors, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were fears that... government agencies had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of "political correctness" to ethnicity and religion."
Cheese Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the removal of political activists from the ballot papers to stop "the harvest of votes".
The report, which is under consideration by Teresa May, also calls for enhanced registration checks to prevent the use of the voters list for immigration fraud and privilege fraud.
Consideration is being given to requiring voters to present their identity papers before voting.
Use ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Establish a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
To remove political campaigners and activists from working with completed by-pass ballots and post-voting envelopes.
To empower the police to install cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People's Act.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Increase training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, claiming that it is "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfour Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts," he said.
He was found guilty without reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "check-ups" of the electoral registration offices of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's ruling in the Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and hidden spread of selective fraud and the denial of certain organs threaten this good reputation.
Cate's bicyclic and other doppelgangers of the famous Olympics in Rio.
The 2016 Olympics in Rio this week were demented by French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be an impressive Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic player is not the only girl fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous doppelganger — at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people on our screens to date, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics with more than a superficial resemblance to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: A member of the U.S. Archer Team Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid.
In addition to Kate's twin on the cycle track, a lot of people online have rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. Brady Allison male archer team caused a hurricane on Twitter after images of him looked scary like a Wall Street Wolf star.
And in fact, the archer found out about social media insanity and admitted that he heard he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will undoubtedly show even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Razerford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Aliya Mustaphaine, with her great radiant eyes, is said to be the exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burga was compared to the star of Glee Club Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is a "sportful version" of the actor Start.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who may boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julia Efimov, may boast not only the same tanned skin and blonde hair as actress Anna Lynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte".
Hard women: Hope Solo's football star, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, have the same faces and eyes.
Not alone: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
In creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason why this couple has similar appearances.
A Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize her delight that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, U.S. football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linnie, and the gold medal winner of Gabby Douglas's gymnast, who can boast of her own beautiful big smile, which looks like the smile of star Gabriel Union.
Olympia commentator at the CBC apologises for saying "dead as a pig" about a Chinese swimmer.
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place on the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on the 4x200 m women's relay pissed off on the CBC live broadcast of the Olympics.
CBC's Canadian broadcasting company had to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stink" and "dead as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was offline when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay 4x200 m freestyle.
You could hear McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC comment team to "sweak her in color," say, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman threw the ball, baby."
Too excited, starting like a stink, dying like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, aged 14, sailed the second phase of the relay in 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to clear the gap from China.
The audience across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language used.
Emmett McPharlein tweeted, "Did CBC's broadcaster just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China died like a pig?"?
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the 4x200-metre-long women's relay final, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Critics on Twitter immediately crashed on Byron McDonald, and many urged him to fire him.
Twitter users couldn't resist hearing how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance being aired.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who were tweeting in response to this statement
The commentator's friend Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers live and our social media followers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not about her as an individual.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words would be interpreted as assaulting an individual.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said at the CBC Olympic Games.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
The buyer Primark insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store.
Buyers didn't know where to take a look when some woman exposed herself to try on panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place store in Falklandston.
The Primer store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Falklandston, where a woman tried on tricutane panties before putting them back on the shelf.
The mother of two kids, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after setting up her underwear, the mystery woman had "dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties off the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find somewhere private to do it-- she just stood there, shameless."
"Everybody was staring when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she liked, dressed again, and went out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, or what she thought of the person who would eventually buy those underwear she tried on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's disgusting to think that someone's gonna take home the underwear that someone else was wearing, and they weren't washed."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff were apparently trying to remove these clothes from the sale after she left, so better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find another woman wearing and taking them off, and they weren't washed."
Primek reported: "Primmark knows about the incident that happened at our store in Falkland on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been removed from the market.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using a crava-mag.
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, Master of the Crava Maga Federation in New York City to find a way to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follow the knee in the groin, and as the attacker bends to the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a gun, and step back, holding the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, forward-looking, execution method is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and punch the assailant in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before you step back and aim at him.
Does that sound hard?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a master of crava mag -- is to give up your cash.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright spends his language on the most filthy places in Europe.
The British traveler has tested his immune system and vomiting reflexes seriously, licking some of Europe's most filthy and disgusting places.
The host and author of the travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, conducted the euro banknotes, the Circus Piccadili rails, the flushing button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment to be called "Lizun Traveler's Guide to Internal Force" has produced some remarkable results.
The thought of licking a flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout Europe, Wright talked to doctors and health workers about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of the licked ones brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing his bowel strength by traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railing to the train station to the flushing of the toilet, this task has no doubt been tested by its immune system.
In the film he made, he said, 'I've been completely carefree of my health ever since I was a kid, and I've been pulling a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, the newly washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer was over 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a film about a traveler called "The Guide of Traveler-Lizun on the Internal Force", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, for example, in the toilet.
In the film, he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the bathroom.'
There's nothing more filthy than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lizun Traveler's Guide to Internal Force" was filmed with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice-President Valio, on snacks, juices and new categories, Niko Woorenmaa, said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at, and at the same time could explain the usefulness of protothetics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it related to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some of them were rather rigid.
I'm glad that some of these licks have been recorded.'
In a survey conducted in 2015, Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated acidic bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestinal conditions, while 58 per cent said that they used products containing added acidic bacteria at least sometimes.
The hooligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall municipal house, on the eve of the eviction.
The hooligan family left their municipal home at a loss of £50,000 after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After being forcibly evicted from the real estate, the shocked officials of the housing and building cooperatives discovered the property in a condition that required repair.
The walls were left with shiny holes, floors were opened, the trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was dirty.
The family is now resettled and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, the resettler at Cornwall Houseing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was a total nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed, because this property is likely to be known as the not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in real estate from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
Several rooms in a house that could be knocked down found some old trash.
The floorboards in the house where the drugs were sold in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Houseing forced her and her partner to leave the house this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The resettlement was welcomed with relief by neighbours who said that their lives had been transformed into a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet, we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of the Cornwall Houseing neighbourhood group, said that the family had been unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly.
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the middle of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a shame the tenant couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Houseing is considering.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying for her surveillance neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police, and members of Devon and Cornwall's community have done, bravely, to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that a social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20 then.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the eviction.
The resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as scales, related accessories and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possession of Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She claimed that the money was to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being rendered homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the rooms in the house have been stained with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they're gonna try to evict tenants who don't comply with the rent rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall police, stated that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can behave without the prosecutor's accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such conduct,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aweiro in Portugal, tourists who adore sunshine were terrified for their lives.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that he was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk.
Here's a moment when scared tourists start panicking, while the moment a low-flying plane picks up over a crowded beach.
Dramatic shots show a military plane flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand strip to Aweiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped to their feet as soon as they became clearly concerned about the sound of the aircraft's engines, but were unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aweiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few recreationists who published a video of a shocking social media fly, said, "It flew very low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed like it was gonna break."
Nuno Arroga added, "I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Aweiro beach tourists were terrified when the plane appeared from fog and flew at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft had conducted a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and had to go down so low as it was the only way to check them out.
The pilot stated that the flight was slightly lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and also claimed the lives of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the thick fog and smog from the forest fires, which worsened the visibility of the pilot.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was assigned to locate fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASP system has been mandatory for public food for over a year, but most of the Petersburg cafes and restaurants have not yet implemented it.
Checks are increasing and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian version of the HASP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - are mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as companies in the field of general nutrition in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Checks of compliance in Petersburg began in February 2015 for Rossimnadzor's business.
But so far, officials only issue fines for certain violations of regulations (see "List of documents"...
Failure to comply with the regulations would generally cost an enterprise of 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second.
The HASP was designed in the United States in the 1960s as a risk-based and food-prevention system.
It was then about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now used in all food plants, not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASP has been operating in TC territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was four years old (the HASP requirement appeared in the TC Regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule applies only to food production and not to restaurants, as explained by the head of the Elena Cereteli Public Council.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
Expected date for resumption of charter flights to Turkey - end of August - early September.
But they won't call for hot demand, because their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts point out.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday asking for the charterers' permission.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of the choice of quality and accessible sea rest is not resolved, as most facilities have already been booked at the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea before the end of September", notes the authors of the letter and emphasizes that the opening of charters in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian sea-based tourism products.
As reported at the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union for Tourism (RUT), if the Russian and Turkish aviation authorities agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed, as yet, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the aircraft can fly in September, even August, if the tour operators quickly build the programmes and arrange with airlines for the necessary on-board flights," said Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RTS.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters was good news, but would not have much effect on market power, because the main buyers of chartered tours - families with children - had already returned from vacation and were preparing for school or taking vacations in other countries.
During the velvet season, the tour is mainly bought by single travellers and couples.
Chartery programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Pavel Rumyans.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now offers very budget proposals – 50 to 60,000 rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of the Optio-Travel Travel Agency.
Otherwise, it's not exactly worth it. The bulk of the journeys have already been planned.
Paul Rumyans also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charterers will also be required, but it is not worth waiting.
"For Turkey, charting is now a rehearsal of the next season," says Pavel Rumyans.
"The opening of the charterers in Turkey is positive news for the next season," agrees Valerie Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from NPFL of statutory compensation payments, within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for injury or other damage to health.
Article 222 of the Labour Code provides for the issuance of milk in accordance with established standards to workers engaged in hazardous work.
However, the rules and conditions for extradition are established by Order No. 45n of 16 February 2009 of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other food of equal value is made to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these rules, the Federal Republic of Russia concluded in the letter under consideration that under article 217, paragraph 3, paragraph 2, of the Russian Federation ' s Constitution, income in the form of the value of milk given to workers on the day of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions is exempt from the imposition of the provisions of article 217, paragraph 2, of the Constitution, in accordance with the rules and conditions approved by the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia ' s Order No. 45n of 16 February 2009.
The Moscow Gasstroybank has not been licensed by the CEC.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the licence to carry out banking operations from a credit organization, the equity commercial bank "GASSTRAYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, ASRA's "GASTRAYBANK" had a highly risked credit policy relating to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and accurate recording of the value of the bank ' s assets have led to the credit institution ' s being justified in taking measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in questionable transit operations.
At the bank, an interim administration has been appointed until the time of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization have been suspended under federal laws.
ASC "GASTRAYBANK" is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It will be recalled that insurance payments to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On the insurance of the deposits of natural persons in banks of the Russian Federation" are provided in the amount of 100 per cent of the fund balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will commence no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the accounts, on 1 August 2016, the ASC's assets of GAZSTRAYBANK ranked 335 in the Russian banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
The Sultanate ' s Kadiza, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akundji stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqqah, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian air strike in Raqqah, the group's sanctuaries in the country, according to ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all this, like a headstone and a will of others, is precisely the risks involved in a trip to a war zone - to convince people to ever make the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, the Sultanate and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Chief Justice if elected.
Democrat leader in the Senate Harry Reed says he's convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected President.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court Judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at the conference call on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland "with a degree of confidence."
The representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would put Garland forward, and simply made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reid claimed that the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "priests" and "associators" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't suitable for the job.
Treats says that erotic calendars are for women, just like for men.
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Ballmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by the Pirelli 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to return to the display of an eternal and classic naked figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can provide pictures online or in person on public castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscow's gonna be given memo about bad-faith Internet shops.
In Moscow, they're gonna issue a memo that's gonna tell us how to avoid being a victim of an Internet shop.
It was reported in Rosspernadzor, written by M24.
It is reported that specialists in the department are preparing a memo that will help citizens to correctly choose an Internet store and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure has several sections.
These will be general information and legislative frameworks, rules of delivery, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to prepare the claim correctly and so on," explained in Rossupnadzor.
The memory is currently being finalized.
It will subsequently be posted on the website of Rossimnadzor in Moscow, and it is planned to publish a printed version and distribute it to Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in an organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Citizens of Ukraine and Russia who had assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts had been detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zachtei Andrei Romanovich.
"They all give confessions," says the report.
Previously, a resident of the Zaporozh region of Evgeny Panov, who had been detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty during interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google with 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation of 438 million roubles, which is mentioned on the website of the agency.
"Google's fine for violating anti-monopoly legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fine soon," the deputy head of the FAS, Alexei Docenko, said.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplied smartphone manufacturers who were sold on Russian territory with Google Play applications only on condition that other applications of the corporation were installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine that should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the FL "On protection of competition" (on abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the enforcement of the regulation will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law "On the Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, among others," noted the head of the Russian Federal Office for Communications and Information Technology Regulation, Elena Zaev.
The police suspect 16 Russian stores of conspiracy.
The New Books Network has been fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The New Bookshops are fined for selling Stace Kramer's 50 days before my suicide, reports the Moscow City News Agency.
According to Rosspernadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be regarded as "producing or motivating the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents".
The Sstankin District Court confirmed that the requirements for the distribution of information products to children had been violated and ordered a fine of 49 copies of printed materials arrested by the Rossimnadzor Department.
A source at the New Books confirmed that it was a work by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstore in Moscow has been tested for a book entitled "50 days before my suicide".
There will be an Ernst Unknown Memorial Day in Moscow.
In Moscow, there will be an evening of memory of Sculptor Ernst Unknown, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literary House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown personally in the US.
So it was decided to organize this evening for those who wanted to remember him on their own land," said the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
They said it was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown are invited to the evening, including Evgeny Eutushenko, artist Boris Messerer, president of the Pushkin Irin Antonov GMII, director Mark Rosovsky, and Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Department of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, deputy mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pechatnikov.
It has previously been reported that relatives of Ernst Unknown are planning to hold a sculptor memorial in New York, presumably before 14 August.
The final user of vinyl: Who actually buys records?
Middle-aged single men like vinyl.
And as long as you're not trying to contaminate the section of the comments with gross insults under the pseudonym The Lonely Men Middle Year, this allegation is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, so many of the records that have been discussed are due not to the boom among the generations of 2,000 who want to enter the new material object, but to the nostalgia of middle-aged years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are highly likely to be between 45 and 54 years old, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering by amateurs - it has an emotional value: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings within themselves (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and enjoy loneliness (69 per cent versus 66 per cent).
But are the results of YouTube correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of Soho's busy street, wearing a modest gray suit and brute gesturing before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Well, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and mud — hotels, cafes, and Paperchase stores have now flooded buildings once occupied by independent vendors — several music stores with fantastic experts remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores, and I'm trying to assess their age and emotional attitude through observation.
Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, followed by Sister Ray, who is a half-day student, and goes shopping for a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, as shown above (he e-mailed me a picture, I didn't chase him home), follow lines on the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles is in part based on his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out and buy the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my fault.
Waz, 25 years old, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouTube profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people under the influence of media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the obligation to buy their old records.
Based on the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
The customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among the vinyl rebirth figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Ouez, some older clients, among others, are insulted by a cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to be removed to the constants of familiar envelopes for records, objects that awaken memories of serenity.
"I think sometimes it could be filling a void or possessing material things as a sort of calm," says Waz.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the shelving records.
An ICM poll in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a player that they never used, while 7% of those who bought vinyl did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news story, I would probably look seriously confused, paving a shelving of Bosanov's compilations.
The "good" aspect of recovery is what Johnny, 42, has noticed, who works at Sounds of the Universe (calculation: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came in and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it in my shelf," he says.
That's not a big percentage, but that's definitely what happens.
More of a piece, less of music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not old, they're a little less than 20 who just get to know it.
Fopp, who's just taken almost the entire vinyl floor, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores — the last single and sexy pop Wild Beast rather than jazz improvisation — it is nice to see diversity in its clients.
None of them look particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish with 30 seconds standing next to someone.
Eleanor, age 27, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available on the market.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much, she says, so collecting records isn't a very good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she dives into dreams with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it -- it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: city fashioners.
While I create the illusion that I'm looking at jean-skinned shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid every minute before dad and his daughter start talking about buying a Crosley player.
There's a stairwell on the left with the walls of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mix of modern styles and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — perhaps because they are just ornaments, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real art vinyl.
But, given that any focus on these subjects could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients back to Soho for a while, there's almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a segment of the population that is more likely than most people to have more time and money than most people have is one that spends most of the money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouTube results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of women collectors and vinyl amateurs who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in schools or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday walking through Berwick Street records stores, ploughing records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's Arctic Shark — The Longest Live Liver Animal — Video Report
Scientists claim that Greenland's polar shark has the longest life expectancy on the planet's vertebrates.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the female was aged 272 to 512 years and five metres long.
The French court rejects the offer to tear down shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the offer of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees lived.
At this week ' s court hearing, the Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to tear down a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for several euros in homemade restaurants.
Kale's prefecture has said that these places should be demolished because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian teams told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those who needed it.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people who ran 72 homemade shops, but stated that the problems of the Kale prefecture "was fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that groceries, cafes and restaurants were much more important than just feeding people who "live in very precarious conditions".
He said that the spaces provided safe reception points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened with demolition was a children's cafe Book of Jungle at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes and shelter counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors at the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to Guardian stated that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under eight years of age".
Two charitable institutions, Aid to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp had grown to over 9,000, the highest in history, after a dramatic increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The neighbourhood libraries invite young free people to educational programmes.
This week, Philly libraries will hold meetings to celebrate City Day, the Year of Russian Films, and even Physician Day.
The programmes are aimed at the children's audience, so most of them will take place in game form.
Today, 10 August, the library-file number 2, in the librarian neighbourhood, is invited to the Cruise-presentation "My Town is Small."

Britain stops at silver in rugby-7 after Fiji's master class lets them take the gold.
An impressive British episode in Regby-7 was crushed at the final obstacle by Fiji's team in the finals on Thursday evening, when they were completely destroyed at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has been given a master class in ball management, splashing, evasive, playing support, running lines, and brute power to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor comfort in the form of silver — Britain's third in a day — and they were proud of their efforts at the first regby-7 Olympic tournament, where New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated along the way.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, could have come back to affect them in the finals.
But no matter what, Fiji in this form won the best team of 15.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one Britishman will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's Chief Coach, Ben Ryan, former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost one.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started out great, kicking Britain's efforts to intercept the ball for fun.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osei Colinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the watch, Gerrir Tuway added another touchdown to the right flank, which was implemented.
12.0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to intercept Mitchell has kept Leon Nakarawa's horde from killing a third man, but it has only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption, and the clock still had more than a minute... in the first half.
Vathemo Ravo then broke through a few more slow attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
Implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby-7, while Britain was still mastering the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is true.
The UK made massive replacements for half the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several shiny Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK, making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was long on the way to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
One could not but admire Fiji ' s approach.
Mata William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need to be adorned, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on a fully defeated lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji won Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and the UK did a little bit of South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt at each — the difference in British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great leg work, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, a brother 15 to England's team, Anthony, ensured a victory — and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the coach's cancer fight.
There'll be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 hard climbs into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance for their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the buckets, there were three votes in the boat, Coach Robin Williams' echo was always there as long as they were looking for a second in a row for Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in British sports annals to get to that height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we're seeing is two brilliant athletes, sliding over the surface with the elegant swans, not fully reflecting the nature of triumph.
Each gold was surrounded by a battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to incremental gains that were important, and no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's a little bit of a changer for your future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014 in the interseason, keeping the break of the schedule minimal if that could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to pay, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Grabble itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The next moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, the captain of the artillery regiment in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a single race in five years.
This couple has a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We were really in phase.
Helen called: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
It's important not to get carried away right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get in and out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I became an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the deadline for the destruction of the sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of food products prohibited from entering Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitrimedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed on our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, now in effect until 31 December 2017.
Some agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited from entering Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported outside the embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from sale.
Hunting for "prohibition"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, bringing precipitation and lowering the temperature of the air.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees by day.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow, short-term rains will take place, and storms and gusts of wind will be possible up to 15 m/s.
It is expected to rain by day with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12 to 17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also projected in the Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezh provinces, reporting to the Days.
Next week's rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO arbitrators ' panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization ' s rules.
Import rates exceed Russia ' s commitments upon accession to WTO.
"This is the first time WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation," says a message on the official organization's website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "comprehensive".
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is mentioned in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which had imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the U.S.'s behaviour in resolving disputes in the WTO undermined the organization's principles of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made a similar statement because of the American refusal to confirm South Korean Judge Jan Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The president's office has been replaced by a leader.
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration, former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Wyno.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the administration of the President and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
Anton Weino, in turn, stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that President Ivanov ' s administration had begun to carry out to be important and pledged to cooperate with the Government.
Izvesa had previously written that experts considered the situation of Sergei Ivanov's resignation as head of the administration to be transparent and understandable and reshuffling would not fundamentally change the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who has been working for quite a long time in the administration of the President, has effectively organized the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by the deputy head of administration, Anton Weino, a man who knows the specifics of the job.
In Poland, it is accepted that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years ' time the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the shift towards fuel from Norway and other countries.
The Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogslav Mazez, reported this.
His words go to TASS.
"It may happen that we are not going to buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," said Mazez.
Gazprom now dominates the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had supplied almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, a 30 per cent increase over 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
It will be recalled that on 22 July, the Polish competition authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the northern stream-2 gas pipeline.
This month, Poland left a request for gas from Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of gas through the "Northstream II".
Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board, said so.
The North Flow 2 auction will take place in 2017 and the auction is scheduled to be held in autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom did not yet plan to take any action with regard to the intention of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alexander Medvedev stated.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year the Poles had only increased by 42% the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
Gazprom's Deputy added that the mere submission of a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal did not yet mean that the negotiations were terminated.
Previously, a Polish company went to the court to lower the purchase price of Russian gas.
It is recalled that the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimski, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
The Polish contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Petr Naimsky, stated that his country could give up the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new liquefied natural gas terminal, Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
North Flow 2 provides for the construction of two sea pipeline threads with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMA) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
Alexander Hugh, the first head of the SMM in Ukraine, reported this.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, responding to a question from journalists, transmits RIA News.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm and security incidents have not been recorded.
Observers monitored three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainen border.
There was a video of a Jak-42 passenger aircraft landing at Ufa airport that rolled out of the runway 400 metres and landed on the left wing.
The video was released on the 360 channel.
The emergency occurred at 4:30 Moscow time.
The Krasavia flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates normally.
The VVC Security Investigation Department has been investigating the reason for the heavy landing of the aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistur, considers the fact to be incontrovertible.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which is due to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
United Nations specialists have initiated an investigation into allegations of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas attack, suspected of chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft had dropped bombs with poison, but in Moscow the charges had been called an attack.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakat Nour Al-Din al-Zinki of what had happened.
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC as one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, started burning my eyes, became difficult to breathe," quoted an eyewitness's publication.
At least seven people died in the attack and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, action will be considered a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mystour, stated to journalists: "The evidence that this has really happened is a lot."
The non-use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the shelling of its areas is carried out on a daily basis and that terrorists are preventing the population from leaving the city.
As Reuters say, the UN expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in military action.
The current three-hour daily calm regime in the organization is considered "not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped".
Staffan de Mistura, Humanitarian Adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver relief and evacuation sick and injured persons to the city every week.
"We have to send bulk cargo from a convoy of trucks in an area where the roads are almost destroyed and the remaining ones are mined," said Mr. Egeland. "But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are ongoing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will operate every day from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to enable the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to withdraw its military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiating process.
Four people were killed in a series of explosions at Thai resorts.
There were several explosions in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 injured in the attack.
The epicenter of the explosions was in Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners were among the victims, and there were no Russian nationals of four States.
None of the terrorist groups had yet been held responsible for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had hastened to state that the Islamists were not involved.
Several persons have already been detained on suspicion of causing explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the country ' s military leaders.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong beach in the Phuket area and Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Tani cities.
After the military junta took power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, as reported by Colonel Krisan Patanacharone of the police.
It was too early to say what the objectives were, but he added to the Ministry of Internal Affairs that "it is certain that they are not linked to international extremist groups".
It is too early to draw conclusions,' said Mr. Patanacharone.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they're actually local sabotages, and we're trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to police general Sithiči Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely at a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees in busy streets filled with restaurants by tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identity of the remaining victims was not yet known, but it was known that they were residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, there are four Germans, three Dutch nationals, two Italians and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the bombings, according to the Ross Tourism Press Service.
Local experts also linked the explosions to the referendum of 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters needed to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the country ' s Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
It will be recalled that on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country's army, Prayat Chang-Ocha.
To that end, he said, the army had been driven by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed a curfew and censorship, and dispersed the protesters and the upper house of Parliament.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, led by the premiere of Yinglak Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions took place in the centre of Bangkok at the victory monument, where a major protest took place, affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosives were carried out by unknown persons on motorcycles.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The development of conditions began in Dry Loga.
According to JO, the Government was requested to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhumi Log gold mine with two key limitations.
It is proposed that companies with 25 per cent or more of foreign ownership and applicants with no minimum capital of 25 per cent of the State should be excluded from the auction.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the Government a draft order and auction terms for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Sukhumi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), describing two sources of IO familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday night, one of which is specified.
In the Ministry of Nature, they confirmed that the project had been submitted to the Government.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Chloponin's representative said "YO" that the official's office had not yet received the project.
"The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the issuance of the Government's order, and given the deadline for the collection of applications by potential bidders (at least 45 days), the tender may be held in October," says the Ministry of Nature.
According to JO, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as described in the version that was sent to ministries and FOIVA in July (with JO).
The first is the availability of at least 25 per cent of the public participation in the capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on an understanding of FH-57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the draft FL, as already written by JO on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may be excluded from the auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Dry Log is a federal asset (over 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry of Nature, it was confirmed that the project "shall contain restrictions on the admission of foreign companies" but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The requirement for public participation in the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, spoke in December 2015 by JO to the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, "had investment agreements with Rostech".
Those who lobbyed for a restriction on the admission of foreigners do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give up control in Russia's largest gold field against the background of Western sanctions," the interviewer JO, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction, argues.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, stated on 1 August that foreigners "may join a consortium" if the applicants engage them "as financial partners, technological partners".
The interviewees believe it is unlikely that conditions will be adjusted in the government.
A consortium of the largest Russian gold miner, PAO Polius, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostecha, is considered the main applicant for the Dry Log in the industry.
According to AO, in July, partners created SL Goldo, where Polius has 51% of its shares, and Rostech's RT-GR structure has 49%.
In Rostech, the comments were abandoned, Polius stated that it was "indeed interested in the asset" and had all the necessary competence and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," added in Polius.
APLOSA may participate in the auction, but the Russian government's decision was made by the sources of the AO.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets on Chukotka, claimed to be eligible for participation in the development of the Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to JO, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Russian Union of Gold Producers, Sergei Kashoub, estimated the US$ 2.5-4 billion investment in the Dry Log.
The majority of potential applicants are deterred not only by the level of investment but also by the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious re-examination of stocks and technologies for handling complex ores, explaining the JO's interlocutors in the industry.
In the retirement market, the largest M&A deal – KIT Finance Pension Administrator – started the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, a NPF of approximately 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of the GasFund Pension Savings.
The launch of the merger of four pension funds, namely, KIT Finance, Promgrofund, Heritage and Gas Fund Pension Savings, was announced yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of KIT Finance Pension Administrator's funds.
"Reorganization shall be effected in consultation with the CEC, subject to the requirement that the terms of the existing contracts be not impaired", the company's communication states.
The association is based on the Gas Fund Pension Savings.
According to the CEO of the NPF, Oleg Baloshitzki, the consolidation of funds has several objectives: to expand the geographical presence, to concentrate resources for development, to reduce costs, to replicate the best practices of each fund and to optimize corporate governance.
He said that the target date for completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, GasFund Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As at 31 March, the pension savings of the pooled funds had exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts on the fund website, the beneficiaries of the fund owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are now Anatoly Gavrilenco (with 65 per cent of the OA under control) and Gazfund (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched the competitors much later.
For example, the O1-controlled NPF "The Future" absorbed the Stahlfund at the beginning of this year.
The joint NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
"The integration into a single structure, in addition to cost reduction, is necessary to meet structural challenges," notes NPF's CEO, "The Future" Nikolai Sidorov.
The Safmar pension group, the European PNP, Education and Science and the Regionfund, has been working actively since April to integrate into the Safmar PNP before the end of the year.
In 2017, they will be joined by NPF Trust.
"The consolidation of funds will have the effect of increasing control over risks, transaction processes and costs," noted the Safmar retirement group.
The break in the pool of funds held by CIT Finance Pension Administrator can be caused by several reasons, as indicated by experts.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds on which the group was actively located.
Following the amendment of the EC Regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought out by one major player," says the director of the financial institution rating group ACAR Yuri Nogin.
Several top-15 NPF asset managers have been called another possible reason for pauses by the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, by staff appointments in a single fund, which were to be agreed upon by the group owners.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
Gazfund did not respond to a request by JO to the NPF either.
While consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and costly exercise, this solution will be justified in a long distance.
As the CEO of the Pension Partner Consulting Company, Sergei Okolesnov, notes, Gazfund's Pension Savings has fewer outflows, joining will stabilize the base of the group's other funds.
Better experience of the KIT Finance NPF and Promgrofund will be required in the construction of OPS retail sales, as well as in the use of more modern software.
The BC's demands on the NPF's processes and personnel are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, and the director of the company ratings "Expert RA" Paul Mitrofanov considers it inappropriate.
"The effect of the reduction of duplicate functions will definitely cover the possible costs of consolidation," Mr. Mitrofanov notes.
The cost of merging the four funds of Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at 30-50 million roubles.
"The cost of the four funds of this size is about 400 million roubles per year, and if consolidated in the medium term, the budget will indeed be reduced by half", I am sure.
The Russian rental was the best Disney movie "Pete and His Dragon."
New Zealand's beautiful species, a loving dragon, a heart-wrenching story, and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again.
A frightened baby picked up a dragon that became a human baby and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy in a book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, he's so full of grass and a silly bandage, he can't be distinguished from another smug forester, Mowgli.
This is how Pete finds Grace's red haired woman (Brys Dallas Howard), while Gavin's team (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressive in the forest.
Now she's not only gonna have to believe in the existence of a dragon, she's gonna have to help save it.
Pete's going through an accelerated course of being human, surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their hearts, and smiles more dazzling than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible to be truly hated or feared by an audience.
Even Gavin, who has discovered the hunt for an untypical resident of the forests under his control, is far from an incorruptible villain.
A huge, furry dragon, too, was not a scary one, with a good face of bulldog, an air-lined wing and the ability to become invisible.
It's funny, it's purring, it's even snoring, and it's lucky it doesn't talk, but it's always like ironing, and it's good for it, and it's different from all the famous film dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of keeping it together provide such a high degree of emotional engagement that, at the most tense moments, they begin to weep desperately in three streams, not only for small viewers, but also for adults.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuosoally gives out a canonical grandfather that every child would be happy to have.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantasticly cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie Dragon Pete, mediocre from the nose to the tip of his tail, and remember only the mix of animation and play movie, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
It was only a miracle that helped.
In his painting, Lowry basically took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There's some music numbers and a lot of weird jokes left behind.
This fairy tale reads features from the Bambi, the Alien, and many other nice children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the 21st-century gallery of high-quality remakes.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as stunningly beautiful as the same Book of the Jungle, and there's no skilled villain Kate Blanchett's role as stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magical castle are gonna get director Lowry again for the artistic adaptation of the Pieter Pan story.
Worked at Pete and his Dragon, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks have entered a new ambitious project on a non-growing boy in James Barry's story.
The RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged again.
The lawyers of the RBK journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found shortcomings in their client ' s case.
That the D.A.'s office made this presentation, we heard from the investigators just yesterday.
We were scheduled to attend a court hearing on the limitation of access to the criminal case file, but the hearing did not take place and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office," quoted the RBC as counsel for Olga Dinze.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had pointed out to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were inadequate.
The investigators will now have to fill the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (PC) would appear in the case or the same article would remain, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Deanze explained.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015, as reported by JO.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation removed from the charge against a RBC journalist the phrases "disturbing the political climate towards instability" and "conversion of power by illegal means".
The reporter, Commersant boscosport, ALEXANDR ZILBERT, lived the life of an Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian team's house, ate in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test.
I don't think life is going to stop here for a second.
Even at night.
The last start is sometimes completed at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half and two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village are carried out without interruption, as some athletes are completing their performances and leaving Brazil, while others are only arriving here.
As early as 7:30 a.m., heads of all Olympic delegations reach out to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues," says the head of the Russian Olympic team's sports delegation, Igor Kazikov.
The hot water problem is, I'm sorry, the toilet problem.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinical came in, but they just put some stuff on the floor, and that's it.
The floors are, you see, innovative.
Like, you can't wash them like a human being.
We know these floors are laminated!
Anyway, there's been a change in the clearing company, and now it's all OK.
The Olympic village is like South Bootovo, a sleeping area on one side of the mountain, and on the other side is an impressive moat, filled with water.
And for safety, there's still a two-metre-long iron fence around the perimeter, along which automatics walk.
In total, up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in 3,604 apartments in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-story buildings, there's a huge Russian flag - this house is entirely for our team.
If you look at a small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems seem to be the most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the front desk: "Please don't throw paper into the bathroom!" and "I'll take badges for you."
The bar itself drowns in the booklets.
Their hilarious color contrasts with the titles of the brochures, "The Pest for Infective Diseases for Traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, getting a foreign body into the airway, loss of consciousness - stages of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation", "First aid for Burns, Heat Crash, Broken and Bleeding".
The text inside is actually encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, not everyone is looking forward to a favourable outcome.
Of course, Russia has a health centre that is ready to provide qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage, to its residents at any time.
The health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster, "No matter what, we're gonna win!"
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are completely delusional!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, it will not break!
And there's an ad for even more spirit-raising: "Dear brothers and sisters!
Under the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Rusi Kirilla, Protojery Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeyev exercises spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer and other beans on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for meditation and religious rites for all denominations in the village.
And the Russians, it turns out, in their privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Due to the pressure of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, he tripped over the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, it was a sleeper employee of a new clearing company.
I guess they're ready to throw themselves at the innovative floor wash at any moment, and they've decided to have a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I had a meeting with a long-standing acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our Batutists who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his child, the European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
There's not much to complain about," says Russia's well-deserved coach.
It's one for four, but it's spacious.
The closet is funny, of course, out of tissue, untrustworthy, but things can be put down.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Its main name is at least because it is a 2,700 square metres space and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 meals per day for free.
The menu options are "Best of Brazil", "World's Kitchens", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta."
The last option, as I peeked, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the giant restaurant units.
- I'm surprised at the soup.
It's a good thing I brought the Chinese with me, the weed.
And a kettle.
But just so you know, the food on the court is even worse.
There's something you can choose, despite the insufferable uniformity.
I personally picked a cod for a pair and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A tablet with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens, is placed next to each dish.
Well, I'll admit it was edible.
I don't even understand why it's a local McDonald's all the time.
Rich, relaxed, you can say "hot" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
It's tricky-- Victorian, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
They're gonna trigger it, you know!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight questions out of ten.
I've got some questions in Russian.
But he attacked the wrong guy.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, naturally.
The situation has already worsened on the second question: "If I have received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I'm talking about option B, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost his guard, so to speak.
I forgot that WADA wasn't gonna let you down.
Anyway, we gotta get in there right now.
And in the seventh phase of the quiz, my situation became very critical.
I thought, for some reason, that if I find it hard to keep a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and I'm having a hard time!), I can use bio-additives to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
An no, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly in several sentences it is not.
It's not fair for WADA to play it!
What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go behind Efimov, Isinbaev, and our entire bloody team.
That's why I'm focused and I've won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I snuck into a fitness center next door.
I got carried away with counting the gyms.
It's down to 250.
Surprisingly noted that no Russian athlete had ever been found in this build-up of racing tracks.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the one who can't play practice!
And there's this guy in the nearby clinic.
In line for the eyeist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
The clinic, like the entire village, has a condom distribution machine in it.
On it is an encouraging call: "Get rid of the condom!"
The only thing left to do from now on is turn a gland like a door lock handle, and a condom made of natural Amazonian latex readily drops out of the machine.
I took one to remember.
The athletes won't die, they've been brought in 450,000.
There is an entire entertainment centre in the Olympic village for a celebration and celebration.
There's an educational sign outside of him that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, pool tables, tennis tables, table football and hockey and some kind of weird device that looks like video training.
I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team that's actively using a wild toy.
You could have just said you didn't want to talk to a man in the form of Russia, and that's all.
By the way, it's kind of weird to see a bunch of guys in freaky-bleazy.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the whole village by looking into every corner of the village.
But if you're gonna walk, not drive electric cars, you're gonna get a Canadian team house with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a rehab bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday items, and a post office with unique stamps (only you can't wait for the Chinese philatelists) and a bank, and a finder's office, and a photocopier.
And later in the evening, you will sit by an olive tree hung with coloured ribbons to remember the friends and relatives of athletes who left the world.
And you're gonna be under the machine's accompaniment, randomly spraying insect-killing fluid, thinking forever.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding its breath, watching Australians almost punish American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Deriglas won gold at the XXXI Olympic Games was the first one I got.
Maybe I'm the only Moscowian who's ever seen it happen-- except for the ones who, of course, were watching the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from the bottom, as always by 1:00 a.m., wake up and start to scream at each other with no anger, but very loudly.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's a crane in the kitchen. There's no time to go to the market and buy a new plumber.
The TV schedule doesn't make any sense, so it just kept the Mitch, the First and just in case of Rossia, even though it's almost pointless.
Rossia is a home country of repetition, and sports are on record for some reason.
It's a live show.
Hope, of course, for "Match" all night, a young man yelled in news issues first about the great semifinals of Deriglas-Shanaev, then about the coming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball -- U.S.A. -- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong with that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put them in place of America's freaking greatness.
As a result, they lost, but as we now say, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a fight with Di Francesca, and there's no change on the screen.
I'm starting to lose channels in an easy panic.
I feel like they're spinning for the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep to the cable.
None of the thematic "Match" fencing.
Oh, it feels like the fight's about to start.
I don't like the text and tweeting of some sports sites.
Super-road surfing is an unexpected but brilliant result.
The site "First" shows a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at that point in time.
I'm gonna fencing, I'm gonna fight for gold.
Dericlesova's doing a great counter-attack, going forward on the glasses, and she's obviously starting to take time.
The Italian woman's playing almost the whole thing.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesca throws herself at Deriglas, she retreats, time runs out, an Italian woman gives a shot.
Victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic Massier on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Muslim Spiritual Authority (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenary of the DMA ordered its imams to preach Friday only in Tatar to force young Tatars "to learn their own language".
The Office states that this "in no case shall prejudice" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The Imams fear that their sermons in the Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenary of the DM-Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the country ' s mosques only in the Tatar language.
As Tartarstan's mufti Camille Samigulin has said, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learning their mother tongue".
"For those who say it's hard, in every big mosque, we intend to teach the Tatar language entirely free of charge," Mr. Samigulin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques of the sermon "should be already in the Tatar language".
He recalled that DUM Tartarstan publishes a magazine called "Shura" with model sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who doesn't speak Tatar well, "may well prepare for them."
DUM Tartarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the muftis, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language in the districts.
At the same time, in Kazani, a number of mosques had previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, the mufti indicated that this had been practised in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership is responsible for ensuring that all students speak both the national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm to non-Muslim Muslims can be said," Mr. Muhamethin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, essential part of the prayer".
However, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, while lectures and lessons in Russian will be retained in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said that there was no serious threat that the Tatar language would be removed from the mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the Republic.
The decision of the DMA was actively supported in the executive committee of the World Tatar Congress (WTC).
WCL's executive head, Rinat Zakirov, said, "The mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tartar language were to be removed from this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "the wish of the imams themselves," but in the WCL Executive Committee "considers it right".
Imams interviewed by the YO who preached in Russian are willing to execute the decision of the DMA, but they believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the priests.
The Tartars and the Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand language.
They'll be a little tight, of course.
"I have to rebuild," says the imams of the Burnaev mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
He said that Russian-language sermons were closer to many Tatars, since "Russians are both in schools and in kindergartens and radio are everywhere in the first place".
However, he believes that lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days, can be continued in the mosque.
We put our trust in God.
Allah will bring about a way out of this situation."
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will "get to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience".
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"I, for example, will feel better because the Tartar language is my mother tongue," Gabdullah Galileo concluded.
Former Director of FIN has been brought to justice
The Prosecutor ' s Office of Moscow confirmed the indictment of a criminal case investigated by the SRA on the misappropriation of budgetary funds allocated to the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service.
Alexander Reimer, former head of the prison department, and his deputy, will be brought to trial, causing more than 2.7 billion rubles of damage to the FIN.
The capital prosecutor's office has sent criminal proceedings to Zamoskorek Rabst against Mr. Alexander Reimer, former director of the Federal Penal Correction Service, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapova, and Viktor Obrenov, director of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service's Information Technology and Communication Centre (FCN) of the Office of the Procurator-General.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the Criminal Code, pursuant to article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, paragraph 4 of article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (a fraud committed with the use of their official position, in an organized group and in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, between 2010 and 2012, the individuals fraudulently stole from the State Treasury the budget allocated by the SIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for persons under control, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal money, the group developed a scheme whereby CITES, a company under its control with which the relevant government contracts had been entered into, carried out technical controls and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and implemented at a price that had been overstated several times.
Despite the fact that the CITOS FGP did not have any production equipment, buildings or facilities for the installation of production facilities that would allow the production of a complete cycle of "electronic bracelets", five State contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Russian FIN.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were deposited in the accounts of the Samaritan branch of the FGP, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As a result, Mr. Raimer personally received more than 140 million rubles of cash in his office from an accomplice whose criminal case has been assigned to separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the scheme, was found to have an unknown source of ammunition for the award gun, which allowed him to be charged further.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penal Correction Service filed a claim for compensation of 2.7 billion roubles.
Football player Hakan Shukure is suspected of being involved in a coup.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then MP Hakan Shukür and searched two of his family ' s houses.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, the attacker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the national authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who graduated from a sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group".
This is the "Hismet" movement, a society associated with a prominent Turkish religious figure and oppositionist, Fethullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdoğan who considers the attempted military coup of 15 July to be the mastermind.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukür had been issued today, and the police had already carried out searches of two houses owned by a former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, his father was also a member of the Fethullah Gülen organization, in addition to Hakan Shukür.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated for the country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaraya.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as English Blackburn.
True, he hasn't spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur is still Turkey's most effective attacker: 112 national team and 51 scored balls.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post because of an ongoing corruption investigation around Erdoğan's party and its immediate environs.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurryet, arrest warrants for at least 42 journalists were issued in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and of being associated with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the seriousness of the charges, the media can wait for long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Conchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian movies, which cost two to three times less tickets than for foreign films," he said.
Mr. Conchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for a viewer with large golli-wood tapes.
We make more than 100 paintings a year in the country, with an average of 20 to 25 tapes.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in which huge budgets have been put in place," the film director said.
On 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began work in Crimea.
Participants include creative teachers and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian backgrounds from all over Russia and a number of neighbouring and long-distance countries.

J.N. - The new general contractor promises to turn in Zenith-Arena by December 26.
The new general contractor for the St. Petersburg stadium, which is to host the Games of the Cup of Confederations 2017 and the World Cup 2018, Metrostroy promises to surrender the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the Interim Commission of the Federation Council for World Cup 2018 Wadim Tulpanov.
"Today, together with Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, we visited the construction site, and we were accompanied by the CEO of Metrotroya, Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd give up the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious peterburg company, it never breaks deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I were satisfied with what we saw and heard," quoted by the interviewer's agency.
Vitaly Mutko had previously come to St. Petersburg to inspect the venue for future large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipanov also noted that his Sovfeda Commission would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would make regular visits to the construction site.
It will be recalled that it was reported yesterday that Metrostroy would complete the construction of Zenith-Arena and that the contract would cost approximately 5.4 billion rubles, and that the same company had won tenders to improve the area around the stadium, the contract value 2.4 billion rubles. The contracts with AO Transstroy Corporation, the Transstrom Engineering Corporation and the Transstroy Engineering Corporation were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to compete for the stadium.

In Miasse (Chelabine province), the lawyer of former Vice-Governor Nikolai Sandakova Konstantin Akulić has been detained.
According to AL-South Ural, another defendant's lawyer, Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulić, was summoned today to the investigation unit of the CSR Miassas to charge him in a one-year-old beating case.
Then Konstantin Akulić went to the scene as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"It was originally brought against unidentified persons, and now that he has begun to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turns out that it was Akulic," Sergei Kolosovsky says.
Konstantin Akulić became the ex-resident ' s lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before a lawyer was summoned to the CSR, the defence was informed that the deadline for reading the fraud case file against Nikolai Sandakov was due to expire on Monday.
Two criminal cases have been brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first case, the fraud case, he is accused of a promise for 1.5 million roubles to facilitate the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer of Ozersk Evgeny Tarasov to the post of Mayor of Magnithogorsk.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe which Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from Igor Kalugin, Director of the PEC, in the form of illegal donation of property services amounting to at least 1.3 million roubles.
Read more about Mr. Sandakov's case in "The former Vice-Governor demands that his affairs be united."
The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is prepared to assume social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has undertaken to modernize one of the country's oldest and most environmentally polluting enterprises, the Karabash copper-melting plant.
The Karabash copper mill was founded by an English joint stock company led by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the economy, and it actually ensured the life of an entire city.
In the 1990s, however, production was halted due to financial problems, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to reactivate the Karabash copper smelting unit.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant, the ecological one, also needed to be addressed.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious for environmental disaster.
The situation for Karabashmed began to change in 2004 after the company was placed under the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company has begun to modernize production, gradually reducing the environmental burden.
The Governor of Chelyabinsk province, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the Karabashmed in early July, also recently noted this.
The head of Southern Ural described the huge changes that have taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmed joined the RMC group.
The main modernization of the Caribbean Media in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphur acid plant to capture up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Allwold Levin, investments in the project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage in the modernization of the Karabashmad is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, dusters and gas canals is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
It is also planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant at a cost of 1 billion roubles at the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes charged to the Karabash city budget will also increase.
For the entire duration of the Tominsk GOK project - from the start of construction to the entry into operation of Phase II - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
And once the GOC is operational, all levels of budgets can generate taxes of 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varen region, 346.3 million roubles were allocated to different levels of budgets.
And that's the first year.
"The longer the business works, the more the deposit may be," added Valery Ulanovsky.
In the RMC, it was clarified that in 2015 the taxes from the Miheev GOC were close to 1 billion rubles.
However, RMC enterprises ' participation in the life and development of their territories is not limited to taxation.
RMC enterprises help repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and the improvement of territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was the major renovation, and in fact the almost complete restructuring of N9 kindergarten by 95 children.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency state.
Also located in the area of RMC Arena is a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and overland parking for 600 machine rooms, cafes and sports stores.
The RMC Arena will allow for the holding of spectacular professional sports events at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise and sports in comfortable environments accessible to Chelyabinsk residents, especially children.

The staff of the Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that young people living there were engaged in prostitution.
On Thursday, August 11, it is announced by The Local.
According to him, some teenagers told the agency that "someone in Copenhagen is organizing prostitution".
According to the publication, the concerns of the shelter workers arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan spoke of similar stories in Malma.
In 2015, the European Union experienced a crisis due to the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has placed more than 20,000 of them in its territory.
A rare blue lobster was caught by a fisherman off the Cape Cod peninsula in the United States.
The man found a shellfish among the others caught in his underwater trap, reporting to ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to the local aquarium.
Lobster weighs about a kilo.

The pensioner turned the stairwell into a "budget beach tower."
Network users laughed at photographs in which an elderly man had installed a stairwell on the beach and turned it into a jump-to-water tram.
The picture was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the "My Taganrog" group on the social network "VKontakte", which led many to believe that the photograph was taken on the shore of the Azov Sea.
In the commentary, "innovation" was referred to as "budget tower" and "mobile springboard".
Many praised the man for his inventiveness and "smoothness," and some pointed out that the man was seriously at risk of getting hurt when he jumped from his tower because he had established it at a low depth.
However, one of the switchboards on the Pikabu portal pointed out that it was not possible to judge the depth of the sea from a photograph.
"First, we don't know what depth it is, the beach can be in the floor with a sharp descent of a meter right behind the stairs, and second, even if there's a meter of depth, you can jump a couple of metres with the right skill," wrote the user under the name C0JABAMDJZ.

Migulu was found guilty of offences under articles 286 (Excess of authority), 285.1 (Unearmarked expenditure of budgetary resources) and 285 (Ill-use of official powers) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that an official in December 2008 had provided his acquaintance with land in the village of Muhinka, in violation of the procedure established by the land law.
In 2006, he illegally ordered the acquisition of the city's road bridge over the Chigiri River, at an overpriced price without competitive procedures and the conclusion of a municipal contract, specifying Interfax.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Miguli changed the payment dates of the contract for the sale of the land that had been provided for the construction of the dwelling and also exempted the company from rent in the interest of the commercial organization under his control.
As a result, the region ' s budget has lost more than 5 million rubles and the city ' s treasury has lost about 21 million rubles.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Thailand has accused local saboteurs of bombing resorts.
The bombings at Thai resorts are "local sabotage" and have nothing to do with the activities of international terrorists.
According to Reuters, the Thai police reported it.
According to the police, they have not yet been able to determine whether any of these explosions are related.
The main theory is that their organizers were trying to sabotage the tourist season.
It is possible that the explosions are being carried out by Muslim separatists from the south of the country.
Several people have already been detained by law enforcement agencies.
Four dead and several dozen wounded are now known.
Prime Minister Praute Chang-Ocha ordered additional security measures to prevent further explosions and to exclude possible casualties.

The owners of the media and postal services must identify the users and remove the prohibited information - this is the outline of the draft law drawn up by the Media and Communication Union (MTS) which brings together the largest Russian telecommunications operators (at Vedomosti).
The employees of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of democrat servers.
US officials are considering the imposition of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama's administration is reported to have to formally charge Russia's servers or Russian-supported hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyber attack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name hackers.
The exception is the 2014 break-in of Sony Entertainment Pictures, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, writing a publication.
Even if officials had concluded that the hackers had acted with Russian support, they would have to weigh the consequences before deciding on disclosure.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that the Barack Obama administration allowed sanctions to be imposed on a State whose hackers had hacked the Democratic Party ' s National Committee servers.
WikiLeaks published e-mails from the National Democrat Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the break-in.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles.
The reason was the lack of competition in the mobile application market.
The anti-monopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-positioning of applications from other developers, in particular Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company had abused its dominant position in the market and imposed the installation of other applications with Google Play.
On the basis of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google and informed the deputy head of the FAS, Alexei Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition law.
Google, in turn, intends to examine the decision first and then decide on further action: to execute it or to challenge it.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to do so.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will lead nowhere.
A leading analyst, Mobile Research Group Eldar Murtazin, expressed this view.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.
Volzhanin rented the apartment and then stole 84,000 rubles from it.

Anime effect Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon on Asians.
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users per day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character into a painting of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lenses are crude, curved tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become known to the public.
Snapchat's lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of their faces or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week, which gave them pink eyes, crooked teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon for Asians, the yellow-faced.
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to a more serious diversity problem for the company.
There were reports on Wednesday, followed by anger in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced that it had been removed.
The company commented that the lens was conceived as a tribute to anime characters, not as an Asian cartoon.
But experts who know about racism are familiar with the lens's reminiscent of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "insulting and at least embarrassing".
She added that "it's hard to argue against comparing a very rough Asian caricature and filter effects side by side.
This shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a highly humiliating yellow face.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the développements that we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to be understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Ju, "it's much harder to go undetected than it used to be."
On Thursday, Ju, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in recruitment in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the company's white leadership, consisting of only men, and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: "Of course they didn't have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they don't hold positions in which to speak safely and openly."
Other observers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented sectors of the population and actively try to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Ju said that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them that this isn't going to work."
The military leadership distorted ISIL intelligence, reports the congressional committee.
Officials from the Central Command of the U.S. Armed Forces changed their intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the reason for the events on the ground, reported to the Congressional Commission in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by the Republican Presidents of the House of Representatives Committee for the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Sub-Committee found "broadly widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who claim that the leaders were guiding their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by Centcom's highest command tended to give a more optimistic picture of the US anti-terrorist action than the actual evidence from the scene confirmed, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," said a news report.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military is suffering," said House Member Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the irregularities that occurred continuously in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American activities aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered false reports, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
"For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than actual events," the report reported.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's certain," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the highest U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service authorities forged command intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been tampered with.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, pending investigation of Centcom's intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"between 2014 and 2015, the Centock created an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and Iraqi security forces," states a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the main representative of a democratic party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiffa, has "suspended the issuance of intelligence documents", has damaged the morale of analysts and "is not sufficiently reflective of divergent views".
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to bring their findings under a "intended or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of the Pentagon, opened after Centcom's analysts complained.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, the Pentagon's spokesman, said in the statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congressional report while the Chief Inspector's investigation was ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now claims to be increasingly active).
But last year's statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics of intelligence on the Islamic State repeat disputes that occurred more than a decade ago when Centcom Intelligence Analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that President George Walker Bush's administration, due to protests by many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State intelligence protest.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the aerial bombardments at the Islamic State-owned oil refineries did not cause a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Central Command Gene Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins four consecutive women's grass hockey games, bringing us closer to a decisive battle with Britain.
She once scored three goals in a match that ended up winning Japan with a 6-1 score, and on Thursday, Katie Bam opened the account with the first two goals for the U.S. Women's hockey team on the grass when the Americans won India's 3-0 team.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, age 27, says she's not sure if she'd ever do something like that.
"I can't put it in my head," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who tracks his goals.
She knows that the American 4-0 at the Olympic tournament, and they're competing for the first place in their band with Britain, which remains undefeated after losing Japan with 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first tour.
Both teams compete for the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will be the first in their group of six teams and who will be the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little while before the quarterfinals begin.
Saturday's game, however, shows that Americans here made a noise in their surprise series four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time taking a hockey club on grass when she was three (her older twin sisters were playing this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't go through the final round.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates weren't getting along well.
The following year, Coegue Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical training change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity we have now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative into her own hands.
She made a long walk with the ball down the left side of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral and sent the ball abruptly into the gate, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa González added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first in the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs tournament to miss one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's on edge.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it is depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the ferocity of the Olympic Games, "Zen" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio appear to be constant and inevitable, a rabid combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is that burning torch that passes from the archer to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper, or overhear your neighbors' conversation in turn at the cafeteria and not hear about Simone Bays, Katie Ledecki, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who first participated in the Olympic Games, a handsome guy with ducks on his cheeks, might well be among the celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-approved commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fencing artist.
But Dooley, 28-year-old, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic jumping contests on the trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
From the centre, in part in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: gun, bow, Badminton, Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak out modestly in defense of my personal addiction, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the trampoline.
Although Batute jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I have interviewed have not been aware that they are at all Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won the medals on the trampoline, and their athletes didn't make the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians generally share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on the trampoline has an outsider charm, particularly because for an unlit ear, it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a ground enthusiast.
They do have comic potential — the caricature of endless jumps — but also the grace of gymnastics and jumping into the water, the two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batute" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín" meaning "trunk for jumping into the water".
The contestants jump on a giant trampoline, flying almost 30 feet into the air, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and flips) before finally landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to performance, complexity and time of flight, according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
The medal applicants should go further, faster, higher and higher in the gold chase, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth in the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of television cameras, another tingling frontier: the world record or the Olympic record.
This obstinate pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical — enough to make even an spectator cry.
But, in my opinion, it's a bit exhausting when you watch the Games.
He's giving us a break from jumping on the trampoline.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she leaps, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And, of course, there's no competition or difficulty in them, but there's no crazy enthusiasm for the finish line, no long jumps, just a wonderful, elegant loss of time and gravity.
It is the closest to Zen's Olympic sport.
The women ' s qualification competition, followed by the finals on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1:00 Eastern European time, and the men ' s on Saturday, also on an hour.
The NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon programme from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, there is a calm, beautiful moment that can easily be seen in a common landfill.
And if the rise in consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to the desired views and objectivity — as the Wall Street Journal has recently suggested for male hymnists from the United States — Dooley is just waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"The Generation Objections" in Ethiopia, a long-standing U.S. ally
The violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrations calling for political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the Government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of being divided?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country by expanding its territory.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have come to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response had been harsh.
Witnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot dead by police officers.
Video recordings from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It's always been hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it's gonna be even harder," said Rasheed Abdi, the head of the African Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia had hardly been a model of democracy — human rights organizations had consistently referred to government repression — opposition in the territory of the State had been stopped, at the expense of de facto silence on the part of dissidents.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly repressed and left with no option but to protest, there will be an uprising," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints ranged from land use to the taking of power by a government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the government party and its allies completely overcame the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, which have been boiling deep down for several years, are now exploding.
The first one seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government closes down Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxie servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves for the protests.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian high places in Ethiopia has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will work together under a single lead," said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics, are unfairly dominant in Ethiopia.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly able to recognize the first signals of displeasure and used spies to obtain data and clear the enemy.
"The current regime lacks common sense," Abdi said, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hylemariam Desalen, came out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Halemariam is southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed as a result.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005 was when thousands of people protested against what analysts said seemed to be elections that the government had screwed up and then forged the results.
During the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in a smaller number than in recent months, a period of unrest that passed relatively quickly.
The development experts commended Ethiopia ' s leaders for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this did not stop the Ethiopian Government's growing internal displeasure.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city of Amhara, attacked businesses belonging to Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming comprehensive.
Analysts claim that protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose its strength in an already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this tight rope," Abdie said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to put an end to the last conflict affecting his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party's presidential candidate to approach the American people wisely.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward position, because they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
In making this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded ISIL.
But in a Twitter post early on Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just freaking out.
This post was a direct contrast to a statement made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, the Republican presidential candidate did not seize the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to shift his campaign to the economy against the background of a downgrading.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the Michigan economy this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to get back to the subject.
Once again, by using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to higher taxes and said that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm as an excuse before.
At the end of July, after he came across a general criticism, practically suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course I'm joking."
Such an approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and to take his words back when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that find feedback among his fans, watching them act, and then "explaining" them to some side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analysed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows they're vague enough to be treated differently.
Instead of softening the rhetoric for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, released on Friday, showed Trump's downgraded to Clinton, with a large weight in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and with it she is at the same level in Florida.
Although Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the subject of increased attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have embarrassed his faithful allies: they have to support him publicly, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputies to Trump, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIL was almost unknown to a tiny organization, he called it no threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he withdrew from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans claim that Obama's administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East in a harsh manner.
Prior to the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for disillusioning and prejudicing each of his words.
He bullied the "poor poor" television experts who tried to solve it and said, "They're weak!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuses as unnecessary proof that he wasn't eligible for president.
Once displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
The Wireb Coffee House was scavenged, accepting only cash in Williamsberg, which did not contain Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was removed from her window on Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri store, which took the place of Werb in the summer of 2014, sells cupcakes soap.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a new town.
"New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and "Werb" is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is in turn being updated.
The Renaissance Virb coffee shop opened in November of last year at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original site.
The new Verba has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor it in a new place, he said that he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left much behind.
Werb works with the same bagels distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even contains chandeliers from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu contains bacon sandwiches, eggs and cheese, and has caper topping or fried onions.
There's brown rice.
The coffee shop doesn't serve beer anymore, but now they're making fresh juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old regular clients.
"A lot of former clients have been priced out of Williamsberg, too," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often attended the Virt.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still stopped by.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that I had been embezzled in Verba," she said.
Now she's drinking her coffee again, although that day, instead of her usual ice coffee, she ordered a bathed tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been a dedicated visitor to Virt since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At fifteen past eight, every day as clockwork, I came, and for me my bagel was made with butter and all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez told me he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still making a routine order, but someday he'll change things with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the stuffing.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap shop once owned an old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri suggested that they make special soap for Verba using coffee from a cold coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice point plans to spill bottles and sell cold coffee.
There's a possibility that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new "Virb" will put their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and told him that he was devastated when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he came inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long have I wanted to feel that scent," he admitted.
Depressive diet of depression at the Twilight Eat
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fancy Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato mashed potatoes, and prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
The last book, "Raga in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Zigelman told the story of her life in a rental apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "Hom 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new joint work, "Slot Food", to be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
With some of their own cooking solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny little diner in the Flatairon Quarter, which has been in operation since 1929, the year of the Mayor's Crash.
Zigelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and an olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, potato mashed potatoes, and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussing food in the depression era.
"The wheels were in great demand," said Zigelman.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Cow's wrinkled.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a rock," he said.
In the years before Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and freshly baked pie served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The "Slot Food" describes how the country managed to stop being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and casseroles, became basic foods; casserole is "a fine way to dispose of scraps," Zigelman observed, because cooks could hide non-appetite ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
For many years, meat, the former base of American food, has become economically distributed by luxury.
People tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
In her research for a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a dish from that era: baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table was not a success," said Coe.
Zigelman added, "It was really weird."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the liver onions at all.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
More than ever since then, domesticists — including Louise Stanley, the head of the federal Home Economics Bureau from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country's food habits.
In publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget preparers," accept the challenge, and transform the burda like a paghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"Slot food" is a feast of curious historical facts.
The government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let them eat pies" attitude, is particularly interesting.
Publicly glorified by the simple farming of Iowa during his childhood, he fed like a sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, such as pickle sauce fish," Coe said.
He ate in a practically gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantasticly removed from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, and this led the White House "to consume not only the saddest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgusting food ever made."
Many of the cooking techniques of the Depression era were forgotten once the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they understood better the food habits of Zigelman's mother — that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being careless about food," said Coe.
Zigelman says, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was one nasty case of pros.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert they made at home: the prune dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune mousse," said Zigelman, adding that it was a common technique - to give humble recipes to throw names.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly put a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe asked for more twice.
He said to his wife with the voice of a confident budget maker, "A little pickle walnut wouldn't hurt."
The arrest of the figures in the case of the massacre in the Howan Cemetery was extended until 14 November.
The Presnen Court left the case of the massacre in the Hovan Cemetery under arrest until 14 November, granting the investigation.
There are 14 accused persons.
It will be recalled that on 14 May, there was a large-scale fight in the Hovan Cemetery of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus using weapons that killed three people.
Alexander Bocharnikov, former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the civil organization Healthy Nation, is charged with organizing the murder.
The second pension indexation in 2016 can be decided within the next two to three weeks.
On 12 August, Olga Holodec, Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, reported this during a visit to the Bryan region.
We have specific parameters in place to increase the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now taking stock of the six-month period, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," quote the Hunger of Interfax.
Commenting on Alexey Kudrin ' s proposed six-month pension age increase scheme by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, the Vice-Premier reported that the issue was not considered in the cabmina.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a full indexing of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigorian went to the finals of a small-calibre rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Cyril Grigorian went to the finals of a small-calibre rifle at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and ranked first, a new Olympic record.
Cyril Grigorian was second, 628.9.
There were eight best athletes in the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opponent Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état," quote Gulena, French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opponent also stated that "if any part of the charges is confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gülen denied any involvement in the coup d ' état, emphasizing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
Let us recall that the attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead companies will reimburse for legal fees during a patent dispute with Merck for hepatitis C.
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to be reimbursed for the legal fees it incurred in connection with the Hepatitis C patent litigation with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc., ordered by the Federal District Judge.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other unethical acts.
In an appeal to the court on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead was entitled to recover the costs incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work at the base of the Sophosbuvira, an active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
United States-supported armed forces claim to have intercepted full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The United States-supported armed forces took full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, informed the group's spokesman on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, and informed Reuters of Sharfan Darwish of the SLM military council of Manbija.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing cleaning operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic Party presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced $3 million in revenue from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, US Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign adviser, Jennifer Palmieri.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and breaking his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It's common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the inspection of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
"Your move," Tweeted Clinton Jan Sams, campaign councillor, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's declaration.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump Michael Cohen told CNN that he wouldn't let Trump release them until after the tests.
Critics of Trump, including the presidential candidate of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republican fellow Republicans, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grasped the issue and released an online video on Friday that focused on the outstanding Republicans who convinced Trump to make the tax report public.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done without exception for decades: to make his tax returns public," she said.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and New York Times, a business columnist, quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who felt that it might still be the case.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people who received over $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was "feared" not the tax collection agency, but the voters.
Clinton's election headquarters has issued tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York City, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index trust fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The Tanzanian environmentalists use an unconventional way of preventing elephants from sneaking into settlements — throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguid Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, together with the American Nature Conservation Committee, took over its promotion by training volunteers in northern Tanzanian villages to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"We have seen a change in attitudes within these communities since we invented the toolbox, and as a result they are much more confident that they will be able to prevent elephants from entering their fields without harming elephants," said Executive Director Honeyguid Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light the torch before the broken elephant and to signal with the horn.
If he couldn't be scared off, the so-called chili cloud was thrown away.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with cotton in a condom, and its end is wrapped, and only the wick remains outside.
When lit, the condom bursts loudly, spraying small dust with chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey since the coup d ' état of July this year.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs head, Mevluth Chavushoglu, cited this information in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 career diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 did not return without objective reasons and explanations", said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
Let us recall that an attempted coup d ' état took place in Turkey in July.
The authorities officially announced that the coup d ' état had failed and had also reported the detention of over 6,000 people, including senior and middle-ranking military personnel.
The attempted coup d ' état killed 290 people, according to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's phone code on the Arab "request", reporting to RT News.
A French director of Jewish origin started a scandal in the media, finding that the Hotel Campinski Bristol in Berlin did not have a telephone code in Israel, and employees referred to "requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanceman, the author of the Holocaust documentary Shaw, expressed his displeasure at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanceman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the hotel's telephone code list.
However, the country was not mentioned among States where it could be called directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
It was written by Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel administration counter.
The answer he received there, according to Lanceman, "shot him."
The hotel clerk said that this measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move caused even greater anger on the part of the director.
"The majority of our Arab guests demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lanceman, a hotel employee.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as "a terrible shame," reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that it happened in Germany, and it's in this hotel network, is even more shameful.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident had a significant impact on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "inquiring about" the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"We would be ashamed," said another post, which indicated that the hotel on the glorious street of Kurfurstendamm was located near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any charges, calling what happened "unattentive" and "excusing" to Lanceman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list," quoted the representative of the Hotel Campinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The students encountered the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Disturbances began when police officers attempted to disperse students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
In line with the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alcmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing on graffiti walls against the Acting President, Michael Thamer.
This last protest happened just a few days after the protesters went to the streets to support President Dilma Roussef, who was removed, when the country's Senate voted in favour of her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, reporting to RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagarian.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in doing business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies resume their ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagarian said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was due to the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Jagarian is also projecting that this year a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly to tourists, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record on the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, which preserve the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
The State continues to spin the nuts in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the CEO of Almam-Antey, the "miss of work" and the "loss of trust".
Gennady Benderski has been appointed as head of the NGO for the next three years.
Dismissal information was not available until Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media coverage.
How can such silence be explained in the context of large-scale rearming of the army?
It is likely that the leadership of the Russian Federation does not wish to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This confirms once again that the defence and industrial complex (PAC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract increased public attention.
The removal of the Nestreod is undoubtedly an important development in terms of industry order.
The NGO Almamaz is a leading enterprise of the Convergence, which specializes in the production of sea- and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems.
At present, Almaz is in the process of establishing the Poliment Redut and Morpheus Zone, which are to be installed on new corvetes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitri Kornev, believes that the termination of the job was due to the delay in the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of the Morpheus started in 2007 and was expected to take place in 2013.
The "Polition Redud" should be the main air defence system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I'm receiving, no truly successful test has been carried out in a few years.
The truth, as far as I can tell, is that there's no definite guilt in this, "Alamas," said Cornev.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning might also occur with the C-500 ARC.
The pilot project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are due to enter the force during 2016.
The DOD is assured that "work is planned and all will be completed within the prescribed time frame", although in 2014 the DOD acknowledged that there were problems with the development of C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the qualifications of the non-Scorodov, who has been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that project delays could be both a cause and a cause of termination.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on domestic processes in the PCO and management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money is known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defence companies leave their posts of their own free will, under a contract of agreement between the parties or are transferred to other jobs.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the leader of the Almasa may have been a streak and resisted the top-down charge.
It appears that the State no longer intends to tolerate such conduct.
By the shareholders ' hands, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the DOD installations and fail to fulfil their tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation is trying to punish those who have been led (machine at the Starship).
The President personally pays increased attention to the issues of the sector.
Vladimir Putin chairs the Military Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of PKC managers by seeking to have loyal directors under hand who will follow orders received from above.
This is a far-fetched policy, but the State does not have other instruments in the face of corruption and lack of normal competition in the JPC.
The present defence situation is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment is encouraging the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces back into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the PTC, the Russian leadership is taking very successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army has acquired a new quality by assuming the post of Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigou.
The president seems to have adopted a famous saying, "Want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow as a sphere of influence on the continent.
The bipolar system has worked well for all its shortcomings.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved this.
The victory ceremony in the cold war eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in a "civilized world," I don't think there's a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and reach the new frontier of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner runs through the finish line, resulting in British capture of bicycle gold.
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to the triumph in a male command sprint at a bicycle in Rio last night, as a result of which the British crew trio defended its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow was the strongest man his Scottish buddy made his own, Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man was proud to enter history, running through the finish line to take out the victory from the favorite team in New Zealand.
Britain claimed its right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning Hoy's fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they finished modestly sixth at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Stuff.
They did it the same time the Indes showed up.
Hoey's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crumpton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing potential in a Scottish man who was now realized.
Hindez, Kenny, the champions of Hoi four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualification, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for the gold.
Hindez was definitely behind him after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindez was on a bigger show to slow down and let Kenny and, in particular, Skinner keep his pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited expert to the BBC and caught Skinner's, Kenny's, and Hindez's eyes when they joined the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make my name.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and won the world's champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez acknowledged that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a failed start.
He later rejected the comment, and there was no way to appeal by British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindez said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many world-named races that winning the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then five more successful days await the cycle.
With the form Kenny showed, it's not out of his reach to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would make it possible to see Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoey, who was also born on March 23, (it seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave's birthday, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister) — bring his account to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It'd be like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old Bolton man said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely winning alone, to be honest.
Hindez said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get knighthood."
It was the only medal prank in a day, but there was the next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dull are the fastest four-kilometre team race in the world.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world gold winning record in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualification race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngawi have improved the world record at 4:13.260.
The British team came to rely on a powerful cyclist team to take over the middle of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After, in fact, exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not the last - the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first-night bike race, it seems that Britain's legendary glory in reaching the top at the right time may be repeated.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all the supply contracts will be terminated.
This is a consequence of the Victorian Government ' s decision earlier this year not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Point Henry metallurgy plant, which led to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland Steel Plant loses money and risks closure.
These actions were the result of reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strong position of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlled portion of the plant is owned by the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not cease," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called hedge contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"Of course, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of revenue in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by projections for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of the "preliminary termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate a steel factory or to supply electricity to a steel factory".
The American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but that it had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the CEO of AGL, Stephen Mickelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It would be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not just the reality star of Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of September's Vogue issue.
Kendall Jenner, aged 20, the model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Chris' mother manager, appeared on the September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder's brand and defied for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"As I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at the cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover news was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) prepared by a reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitlin deboshires, who also joined them as the most popular uncle of the show business, producer of the Kardashian Family, Ryan Seacrest), forgot about their sister's appearance on the cover and, at the end, a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost every episode of children's TV shows dedicated to their birthday (Cycrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed this glory to be given to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to September's Vogue issue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
May Kendall Kim's older sister be on Vogue's cover earlier (she appeared with her husband Kanje West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the most sold issue of Vogue in the year.
The issue attracts a large number of advertisers (from the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year ' s 832-page issue) by the thickness of a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine.
The news of which of the stars will be on his cover is so much to be expected that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have merged to the official annotation.
Among the previous women on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "signs that work as models" than "models that are celebrities" have certainly been presented on the cover.
The Oscar award winner and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga came out.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, described by the magazine as the "excellent model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality shows, or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They're really talented women in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, it was one of the most successful years of his career with the release of Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past television reality show star, was always supposed to be sloppy.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
These moods have buzzed again after the news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover.
But it doesn't make sense to be obsessed with displeasure.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of September's Vogue issue.
It is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sells to you her photos in her own apps, which are available on paid subscriptions.
She sells handmade photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's in a reality show on television.
Public legal centres deny services to 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected people are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further reduce funding to already marginal activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been denied access to free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating beyond capacity are preparing for further reductions.
As of June next year, these legal centres must lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people had been denied a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision wasn't reversed, the situation would only get worse.
"The public legal centres of Queensland are constantly under-funded, meaning that thousands of people are denied essential services," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and failed debts, families through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers all have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected people in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland George Brandis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the funding of free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities and their clients, and the Government of Palmuk is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters was sued after the employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump ' s election headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after it was reported that his operations director in North Carolina had threatened a staff member with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordini said he'd been waiting for months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that "it's not gonna happen."
Director Earl Phillip "took out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and put the blow on Vincent's kneecap," Bordini claims in the complaint.
By complaining to the local and regional office of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, and was being confirmed in a report.
"The guns don't have to shoot to cause harm," Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit took place only two days after the Republican presidential candidate produced a furor, telling North Carolina that "people of the Second Amendment" — understood as arms owners and amateurs — could act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could elect judges.
Trump's election headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in favour of violence.
Bordini's complaint calls for compensation from the campaign headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for threatening physical violence, insulting and causing moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks has been slow to respond to the request for comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip wasn't a success.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Donald Trump, presidential candidate for the Republican Party, ran a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trunmp For Present Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, High Court Division for Mecklenburg District, Charlotte.
Britain must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Rebirth and prosperity, not only in our localities here and in London as a whole, will also bring tricks, but also throughout the country.
To me, it was exactly that great advantage Heathrow had, just like it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make sure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
For our communities here alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment on time and within budget, from T5 -- chosen by the best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two most occupied airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third airstrip, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a huge success for Britain, and I'm sure Heathrow's expansion will be as well.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-mice about blocking advertising.
For companies that make money on Internet advertising, trying to bypass advertising software is a game of cat and mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social media again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the page around its ads to make it harder for advertising blockers to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication Adlock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those who try to circumvent it continues from the moment of the invention of the advertising block", and Facebook may present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network is in the fight is a clear indication of how much of the problem has become of industry advertising blockers.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, according to last year ' s Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times as many people used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising income.
The company, however, is after the public service announcements on the desktop, as mobile advertising blockers are inefficient in the mobile Facebook applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, the desktop advertising is a sufficiently profitable article for Facebook to consider such a step to be a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertisements" tool to give people more control over the way advertising is handled.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters were disturbing, as they would also block some unadvertised content on the website.
"It won't be a good experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the Facebook representative in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rude tool, so instead we've focused on creating tools such as commercial preferences to pass control into people's hands.
The woman was moved on a Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after the woman has moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in a clear suicide attempt.
The incident took place at A1 near Morge in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49 years, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have called on them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logistical" step in such a situation, as counsel for Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve stated.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the highway — the decision was passed that motorists could not expect to see a pedestrian on the highway by accident in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of manslaughter after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Piern last night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and passed out on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a female police officer, who responded to an emergency call, was driving a vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "an exceptional and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Anyone with knowledge of the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus was probably once inhabited, according to the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nassian Space Institute Goddard developed a model for the study of the past Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether there could ever be conditions on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and an atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, like Earth.
The scientists had previously assumed that Venus' small rotation rate was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin atmosphere similar to that of the Earth and still rotate slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but at one time there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid volatilization.
Early Venus was also in favour of the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
According to GISS models, the slow rotation of Venus puts her afternoon side of the sun almost two months at a time," explained in a press release a GISS scientist, Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface of the planet from a significant portion of solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to that previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have been inhabited at one time, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans have vanished and its water vapour has been burned out by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen flew away, all that remained was a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere with a fatal greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model, Venus, in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving as coach of the Avalanche team.
Patrick Roy left as coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
The executive vice president/chief manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as Chief Coach and Vice-President of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of coach and vice president hockey must fit perfectly with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season, and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
A goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with Montreal Canadiens and one with Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Working strikes on oil workers ' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the discussions are beginning a new round of negotiations, as reported by the parties ' leading representatives.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Union and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiating process to resolve ongoing disputes," says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to look at the issues with fresh eyes.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market tensions.
The decline in the company ' s rates occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would provide it with the space needed to overcome the market recession.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries by up to 10, as it would rationalize its activities by its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the declining prices of raw oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision of the UK to withdraw from the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rates of the stars in the Pleiad cluster.
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of orbital speeds of the stars in the Pleiad cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star formations, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at the California Institute of Technology, in a press release.
The Pleiade is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they're never gonna be again.
At their peak speeds of rotation, these growing stars throw out large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds cause retarding effects on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between known star spots, such as solar spots.
The newest rotation speed catalog suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger pirouettes are slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster tend to be very light stars," Ribal said.
Since the Pleiad cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars with rotation speeds.
"The Pleiade's star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both junior and senior," Riball said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where, and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nails.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiad's rotation speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
Two departments are investigating the activities of a group of Ukrainian subversive detainees in Crimea, writing "Commersant".
The FSB gathers evidence of detainees ' involvement in the preparation of sabotages in Crimea.
As previously reported, a confession was made by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energydar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chimzaf in Armjansk, the Fyodosia oil base, the Kerchen ferry transfer, the gas pipeline and one of the military airfields as targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement thinks that not all of the subversives' associates have been apprehended.
This led, inter alia, to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Rise Court of Simferopol, noting the publication.
Stanislav Churchesov was the lead Russian football coach.
At a meeting of the Russian Football Union's executive committee, a decision was taken to appoint Stanislav Churchesov as Russia's chief football coach.
The contract will be for two years, until the end of PM-2018.
On August 11, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Churchesov as the head coach of Russia's football team.
This is a famous football player who previously played in Moscow's Spartacus position as a goalkeeper, as well as a trainer with extensive experience who mentored Russian teams such as Spartacus, Sochi Pearl, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and Warsaw's Legia, who became the winner of the country's national championship and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Churchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will last for two years.
He thus falls under the obligation to prepare for the 2018 World Championships.
It is known that his coach's headquarters will include Mr. Marioslav Romashchenko, Mr. Gintaras Stauche, Mr. Vladimir Pannikov.
There's information that the salary of the entire coach headquarters is 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation has set Stanislav Churchesov the goal of bringing Russia to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considered the creation of a competitive team environment as a priority and was going to give footballers the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad that he took the choice.
The first match, led by Churchesov, will be held by Russia on 31 August in Antalya, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
As a reminder, Leonid Slutsky, the Russian football coach, had previously joined him in training at the CSCA club.
He announced his resignation after the failure of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad results of the team.
Congested between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since its independence from South Africa in 1990, South Africa, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous progress, particularly in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success was the Government ' s emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as self-evident, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools demand tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce "cost recovery" fees.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has become free.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of income inequality, has fallen by 15 points.
At that time, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rating of freedom of expression in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other rich States were far ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable ranking - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Index of Perception of Corruption", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even at a time when commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than one third of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems as well.
The unemployment rate, at least in traditional estimation methods, remains high at almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection, almost 17 per cent of the population being infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is among the upper-middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in weak economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The deserts are inhabited by isolated nomads of hunters, who in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
This is even more difficult for Namibia: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
Namibia, however, did not hesitate to give up, and the country is addressing the challenges it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that their neighbours did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate in sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, and encouraging investment and student exchange.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has rightly considered that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities are aware that the income from Namibia ' s natural wealth needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country ' s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency was crucial to that process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of expression was so important.
As Head of State Hage Heingob noted, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has received, says the President.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and follow-up.
Many have heard of "Golden Varna", the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
It was probably the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the digs of the Varnen Necropolis, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found - more than 3,000 pounds [6 kg] in total.
Only one grave, known as "Higil No. 43", was removed from 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon turn to the unsightly bead type found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port town, Tel Yunacite is located far from the sea near the village of Yunacite Pazarjik district.
Busina is a gold stripe folded into a ring.
Yavor Bojajiev, the director of the Tella Yunacite dig, dated the discovery 4600 B.C.A. and declared that it was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
Varna's treasure, we recall, dates from about the same period, 4,600 - 4200 BC.
There is currently no technology to date metal with perfect accuracy.
How, then, can you be sure of the more ancient gold?
Apparently Professor Bojajiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite certain that Yunacite gold is older than Varna's gold."
It's an extremely important finding: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojajiev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal and will re-examine and study more thoroughly the archaeological sea where the gold artifact was found.
It'll help you date the bead with as much precision as possible.
The location explains a lot, too.
Tel Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yunacite is now considered Europe's oldest city.
The Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium B.C.E.
During the centuries that followed, metal processing in the region grew rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-scale industry.
In domestic history, this archaeological community has a special name: Balkan-Carpathian Steel Province.
In the 5th millennium B.C.E., urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centres.
They are now called ancient cities of Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunacite may be the oldest, since the artifacts of the year 4900 B.C. were found here.
I'd call Tel Yunacite the prototype of a modern city, even though it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place older than Schumer by a thousand years," says Bojajiev, with the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
There, the first cities were formed in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tel Yunacite have been under way since 1976.
Archaeologists have since dug up nearly 12 hectares, about one third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the serf wall, once three metres high, were found.
There is little left of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, city-wide, "business centre" and residential margins.
It is often called "The Bird City", where dozens of clay figures of birds were found.
All birds are shown in a state of rest, suggesting that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
The "Bird City" was destroyed about 4100 B.C. - possibly by the Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
No nomads had cities, but horses and guns.
The three-metre serf walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists found clear signs of a brutal massacre: remains of the elderly, women and children were found inside the houses, with traces of gunshot wounds.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing the familiar notions of ancient human history.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
The "Golden Varna" found relatively recently in 1972 was a powerful incentive to seek that civilization.
Logically, Varna's golden luxury had to have been preceded by something like a tiny golden bead made at Thel Yunacita.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially aged.
It is officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is prepared manually by specialists from the division who work with serial machines.
"Retro-Low" consists, for example, of the special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted into this color.
In addition, the Targa received a signature white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some parts of the body presentation painted in "white and gold metal".
In the interior, the retro-rings are markedly smaller: they differ, in large measure, in the gray-blue shape of the unit, in the new chairs with extended electrical adjustment ranges and in the separate black steel anodized thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a vehicle cover and a rich album with photographs of the production process.
The force setup by the Porsche Exclusive specialists does not touch steel: the retro-targa is quite similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a turbocharged six-cylinder motor of 3.0 l, which develops 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited print, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers have launched an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented advertising on social media pages, provoked decision makers to block the publicity for retaliation.
AdBlock Plus released an antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus promoted its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Social media representatives noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblockable" advertising, the AdBlock Plus decision, along with commercial advertisements, also blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a social media source in TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop website will be available within the next hour.
Thus, social media and blockaders launched a kind of "arms race" in an effort to beat each other, but the injured side became users who missed interesting notes from friends or saw advertisements where they were not used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have been a hot issue recently.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to trial in the Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been concluded with the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmansk Region.
The 54-year-old man charged with sexual assault is very serious.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the Pavlova Street area in Murmansk had committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl, and that a criminal case with a confirmed indictment had been referred for consideration on the merits.
This article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring a Fengguang 370 cross-van to Russia and a Rich New pickup, a driving site www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a popular car class in China that combines the merits of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms in Moscow's International Automobile this year have decided to ignore, so the void of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor will be a powerful front, having large species on the Russian market and intent to offer a number of interesting innovations to our motorists in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which was sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 Yuan (a little less than 550,000 roubles at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach 11th place on the list of the most sold minivans in June, although due to a large road clearance (175 mm) and a protective plastic sheet on the lower perimeter of the body, it could easily be attributed to cross-overs.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the lower model Fengguang 360, with the same wheel base of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), and the design is solider and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden tablets, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on early cross-van exhibition copies, and cars with "music" were sold in a simpler way.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a level loading area 1650 mm long, with a maximum volume of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine has only one - 1.5-litre petrol "atmospheric" of 115 horsepower coupled to a 5-speed mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a spare budget of 6.7 l/100 km for the owner of the appetite.
The Rich New Picap is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a little bit of Chinese design stylists.
Despite a morally obsolete design, the model still has a steady demand for Chinese consumers as a reliable and unattractive "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New is likely to be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 L (137 Ls) or turbodysel 2.5 L (116 Ls).
The gearbox is only mechanical, the drive is for rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected front.
He will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship sedan A9, his Russian premiere was announced as early as June.
Mine-like crossovers on the Chinese market are growing, some of the latest innovations are Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: Sedan S30 and H30 Cross hatchback.
In seven months this year, Chinese dealers have sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by post, the driving website www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the way property tax notices are sent.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the unchanging pattern of years: in the summer and autumn, they receive mail receipts for the previous year's transport tax.
However, many will not wait for them this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without undue noise.
Those who are registered with the Taxpayer's Private Office on the official website of the Nalog.ru agency will come in electronic form.
In the inspection, Russians were automatically considered to be online users and removed from standard, paper-based mailings.
All vehicle and real estate owners will be affected.
Everyone else will continue to receive regular letters.
However, there is also an opportunity to return to the old scheme for account holders on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the writing, while the letter will run for a few days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the online tax inspection service has passed over 18 million, which will allow the agency to make significant savings on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed procedure.
Some people could register in a private office to get a one-time service and forgot about it a long time ago.
These people will not wait for mail notices and will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Taxpayer's Private Office is effected in three ways: through the Gosuslugi.ru portal's record, by electronic signature or by entering the logic and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any branch of the tax inspection (irrespective of the place of registration).
We recall that this year ' s transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
Notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G class, where the refinements are designed to achieve very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept was not embarrassed by G-Power's masters, who took on the modification of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and up to a hundred in 5.4 s?
By inflating the muscles of a crazy gelician, the masters took advantage of the benefits of a 5.5-litre aspiration eight.
Now, the speed of the hundreds has improved by the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying brick is capable of pushing in 5.3 seconds.
However, the accelerations at medium speeds are likely to be much better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h, then a tuning all-road vehicle with a deactivated electronic collar is capable of producing 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of other wheel discs, the 23-inch Hurricane RR measuring 305/35 ZR 23.
The Luke division of Mercedes-Maybach announced an amazing six-metre-long conceptual coupe, which will be presented as part of the Elegance Contest at Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the Green Subbrand BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate brand.
A minimum of four green innovations are expected to emerge in the coming years.
