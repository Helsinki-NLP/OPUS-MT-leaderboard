In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1:00, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging in Lugowa village.
It is known that he has attempted suicide before.
What led a man to take such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, at 11-50, a 41-year-old male resident of Kineshma died in his home.
No signs of violent death have been found, as reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service "Kineshemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the falling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box carefully built on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated American highway financing system undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring arena of motorway planning suddenly generated intense debate and coloured alliances.
Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and, perhaps, where you pass them, and then use that information in tax accounts.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Union of Civil Freedoms is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They reflect on how to move over the next decade to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not a question on which we may have a choice," said Hassan Ihrata, the Executive Director of the Association of Southern California Government, who is preparing plans to begin tracking down the miles of every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
This is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Roads Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't been up for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even one cent at high petrol prices.
"The gasoline tax is simply impossible to keep," said Lee Mannich, transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
His State had recently installed 500 tracking devices on vehicles to test the mileage system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
The assholes call it a mercy user's fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning authorities in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the ambitious state laws against global warming.
However, House Member Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), President of the Chamber's Transport Committee, said that he too saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-market members at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled that drivers will be forced to pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a pardon.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters, who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are recruited to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers are about to pay the state for miles away instead of the gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every move.
"Satisfaction about a big brother and similar things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, the head of strategy and performance management in the Nevada State Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were well under way, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website that it would be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of several states where it is difficult to find low-cost technology that would allow the state authorities to keep track of the miles they drive, but without information about the place and time.
If you could do that, Han said, society would feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It has sought to enter the developing market of the type of car insurance in which drivers pay on a mileage basis.
But the devices that she's testing attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and their location," said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot state programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can give up the device altogether by choosing instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
In other places, they're hoping to sell the idea to the alerted public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax device that will also accept parking meter charges, provide "pay as you drive" insurance and collect real-time speed data pools from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobilists will attract the benefits offered to them," says the urban design document.
Some designers of transport systems, however, wonder whether all the talk of a pardon is simply a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU is preparing support measures for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is in the process of negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential IMF loan, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences about the terms of financing.
Neither does the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step on Friday, to "B-" with "B."
However, the EU representatives said that IMF could be flexible in lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to provide Ukraine with gas, the majority of which is now supplied from Russia.
It's probably going to be a northern stream gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "insulation" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse transfers to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and is likely to result in a decrease in transfers to other regions.
"The EU and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from sources other than Russia or from the same source but on other routes", Reuters added.
Russia outside the struggle for urban pollution by motor vehicles
Efforts to address the transport problems of large cities have been evident in most mega-cities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
In general, these were either the upgrading and expansion of the motorways or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time of their use.
The case of Singapore is well known, with a strict quota of private car growth and the right to purchase it by auction.
Its price can be two to three times that of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fees for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, which are only allowed to enter vehicles with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a "five-year clean air plan" with a total cost of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
According to JO, the Director of Transport Pollution Control of the Beijing City Environmental Protection Bureau, Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no greater than 6 million (now 5.2 million) and to increase fuel use per vehicle by no more than 5 per cent.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are the restriction of the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes for road owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the Green Five-Years include the accelerated transition to Euro-fuel standards compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the labelling of cars and fuels, restrictions on the entry of vehicles into the central part of the city, the prohibition of obsolete vehicles (other than the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old cars with hybrids or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service vehicles), and the development of public transport (including high-speed).
The car innovation in Beijing also includes a ban on all private cars within the fifth transport ring (all six in the PRC capital) one day a week (this information is contained in the vehicle licence plate), as well as the issuance of lottery registration plates for cars (e.g. in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third of the 2010 number).
According to the current State programme for the protection of the environment for 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution is expected to decrease to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, 41 per cent of all emissions to the urban atmosphere in 2011 were "mobile sources".
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are 10 times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Policy, Institute for Transport Economics and Policy, believes that administrative and fiscal measures to suppress the demand for road travel are not popular, but can be adopted by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal vehicles, as well as vehicles of "privileged" users, with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total Moscow fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers are that the city centre is twice as equipped with roads, and most motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time in parking or simply in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking but car storage facilities, not to expand, but to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the area of the historic centre's security zone (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will rise once in a while.
According to the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often do not pass appropriate sanitary controls.
Which means the health of the vlogians is in jeopardy.
Thus, the lower penalty for unauthorized trade will increase sixfold from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles as of November, according to the Press Service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which does not slow down much," declared Goldman Sachs' chief economist in Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday's quarterly report of an investor in the Russian economy.
Russia's nominal wage growth is now about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today we see a substantial increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP rises by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafé explained.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and increased unemployment.
Russian business cannot raise wages, comments the major economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise their salaries in order to lure their employees from outside or to keep them from doing so.
Russia's consumption is supported by a very rapid increase in the demand for credit.
In Mr. Grafe ' s view, because of the very high rates of consumer loans, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the country ' s economy.
"The benefits to the economy of increasing demand for credit have not been seen, the money has not varied in the economy, but goes back to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in default on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide for their welfare.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently", Mr. Grafé noted.
Therefore, the second threat to Russia's economic growth is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.
The Director of the VSE Banking Institute, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to State banks, were forced to raise public funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the warpath and began to lower their credit rates, an economist continues.
Small lending organizations cannot lend at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have negative interest margins.
If the state banks don't give up dumping, Russia faces a full-blown banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The withdrawal of a number of banks ' licences in recent weeks has been seen by an economist as a harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the increase in consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investment bank, due to the rejection of the indexation of government and military salaries in the current draft budget.
The impact on consumption will be offset in part by the freezing of natural monopolies (and consequently by lower inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and the prerequisites are not yet available - see the statement), the increase in consumption will slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the drop in the price of oil," he says.
He estimated that Russia's economy would begin to decline with oil prices below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the BC is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
There was a paradoxical picture: inflation had declined and banks had begun to raise their stakes.
This may mean they didn't believe the C.E.C. that announced the move to tariff inflation," said Clemens Grafe.
The interest policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, but only interbank lending rates.
"For the BC, it's a failure of all hope," Clemens Grafe appreciated.
The money obtained at the BEC auctions is used by banks not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the money is trying to get into speculation against the ruble.
"In time, the BC will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the State is planning to release the ruble into "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do it sooner or raise the key B.C. rate (5.5 percent), he thinks.
He estimates that the ruble's rate is now artificially overestimated by 10%.
There's only one way to get weaker, the expert concludes.
But if the BC casts doubt in the financialists that dismantling the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much more.
The Second Congress of the South Ural peoples was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum commemorates the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all towns and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, totalling approximately 350 persons.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We have no differences of opinion or opinion.
We live in complete understanding," Feofan states, the mitropolitics of Chelyabinsky and Zlatoustsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of national cultural associations in the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the US intelligence issue.
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence debrief, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about his activities.
A German deputy, Hans-Cristian Ströbele, met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented by the deputy to the media in Berlin on Friday, stated: "Even though the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political discourse by criminal charges that offer no protection."
However, it is not a crime to tell the truth.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA was wired by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group in charge of the intelligence service, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely", it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, MP of the Green German Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "rigid and constant" harassment campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the world's reaction to "his political rhetoric".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials — including those in the United States — have found exposing the uncontrolled surveillance system to be beneficial to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers for carrying a hand luggage aboard their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to bags in the upper baggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said she'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers paid only when they arrived at the landing.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 fee should get the passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for this," she said.
The airlines began charging fees for the first and second bags delivered in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into a hand-cooked baggage compartment, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier clients claim that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper baggage compartments.
Passengers who buy airline tickets will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at Frontier's flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and at the Frontier registration counters is intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they reach the landing point.
The new Frontier collection for hand luggage will not start to be collected before summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to indicate that airlines collect enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not deal with hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual treasure collection three years ago, and another Allegian Air DVDer later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said J. Sorensen's airline consultant, who is closely monitoring the surcharges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand baggage fee was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former headmaster of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown a Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the entrance when passengers faced an unusual collection of Spirit for hand luggage.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see a brush of teeth and a fight at the entrance to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the whole can and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
She'll still be handing out free water.
U.S. Airways tried to collect drinks for a short period of time in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its last step in attracting clients to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to go to a tourism online agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many bonus miles to frequent customers who bought tickets via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles she travelled.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose their seats in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her hometown Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
The grant declined by 9 per cent, and the flight capacity declined by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republica is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers, for shutting down the site.
The hidden National Security Agency announced on Friday night that the shut-down of their site for a few hours had caused a technical breakdown, not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update," the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed "failure to maintain" [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site was still not accessible to some users.
The NSA representative had previously informed ABC News that the agency's internal secret network "not at all" had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists claimed that it was responsible for shutting down the NSA website through a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to cover the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the target system's internal network.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once known as "No such Agency", has been at the centre of public attention and intense criticism in recent months, following a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and domestically, all of which are reactions to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has given rise to the fact that today's incident was the result of deliberate action by hackers.
Bombardier's profits are falling with the drop in supplies and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday due to reduced orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway unit.
The company Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for its latest CSeries, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by the next September would be implemented.
After the first flight of a pilot aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test phase was on schedule.
The results did not meet the projections and resulted in a fall in shares of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating on Thursday from "more than average market" to "average market" because of the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
"Despite the generally predictable decline in the number of aircraft, we are certainly disappointed with the rate of return of the transport division," said Dørksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not yet too high — 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the flight test results to verify the company's fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements are now in place with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bauduan was confident that Bombardier would reach his goal of 300 firm orders by the time the first plane was commercialized.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
"The plane's test model did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Boduan during the telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades had been planned for the time of the aircraft's stoppage.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for the update, and that's what we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest will soon follow, as the company has reported.
And yet analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the commissioning date and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although apparently in line with the Bombardier internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, which ended on September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted return on the action was 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that it delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The Portfolio of Orders of the Aerospace Department was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change since December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor," said Bauduan.
Gross revenue from aerospace activities fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that gross income in this sector had increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit's portfolio was $32.6 billion on September 30, which is slightly higher than on December 31.
The revenue of the transport unit was adversely affected by several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock, which also announced that Google's chief financial director, Patrick Pichett, would join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C $4.83 at a bid in mid-Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest rival Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent decline in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, after completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of profits for the current fiscal year.
Sony ' s results from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected, owing to the fall in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially because of the declining demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where sales of companies are growing at a high rate, especially through automobile systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen in operating profits against the expected 230 billion yen previously.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts assumed that the figure would be significantly higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to emerge from the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sales of smart watches were announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need to pull a smartphone 100 times a day out of its pocket.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and revenue forecast, the company lost over 11% of its share in opening the horns in Tokyo in the morning, falling to JPY 1,668 per share.
The speech gene proved to be a catalyst for synapse formation.
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that makes Foxp2's "gene of speech" a function that stimulates the formation of new links between neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be found on the magazine's website.
The gene Foxp2 is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 with the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak the words correctly and sometimes even understand one another.
Scientists found that the work of the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their function is Foxp2 as a catalyst for the formation of new brain synapses associated with speech.
He's doing it thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 acting on it.
The fact that SRPX2 does affect vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mice experiment.
When animals' gene activity was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, so was the frequency of the sounds.
Previously, mice also showed the connection to the Vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene were more likely to feed at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 and the SRPX2 it manages relate to the purely mechanical properties of sound generation or to more subtle processes.
A lawyer with cocaine addiction who warned the gang leader about a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A predatory lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed on to criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information about his drug-trafficking investigation after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who had been called a "cool lawyer" among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation against Scarborough, which he had previously represented at a drug trial.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County, Lancaster, while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta had "regularly used" Class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two persons on Scarborough ' s behalf, as well as of one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at that time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancastire, Kambria, Mercisaid, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
42-year-old Ditta was passing information on to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Ditt Royal Court of Liverpool, which works for the Forbes Socitors Law Company, located in Blackburn, he was disgraced after being found guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer's disclosure came after Scarborough's investigation police found out that he had been talking regularly to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's trash drawer.
Shortly after Scarborough's transfer, he had multiple calls with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta had "regularly used" cocaine after the tests found traces of a Class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted a "lawyer's secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all were confiscated and a hair sample was taken from him.
When he was questioned by the police, he said that along with his workplace, he had a home office and his clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the Court learned that, after important arrests, it had called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell them that detectives knew about them.
In an indictment speech, Anne White said, "If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has had too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove to be legitimate because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal relationship between counsel and client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible from continuing their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but embarrassed it.
He was too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, to question his lack of interest.
Ditta didn't plead guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer I wasn't, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough the information, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancaster police said, "Mr. Ditta became a criminal lawyer as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main participants in criminal groups, who have instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Ditt was led by the Lancaster Highly Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already reached his conviction in three cases of cocaine possession, and now also in obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain a fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case warn criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted for 14 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the scheme were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta arranged a question-and-answer session in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect partner for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and the motivation for his work is inequality.
The stadium in Jaroslavla is not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, and police officers who were present today at the meeting of the FRC.
The ticket programme is, in their view, about double.
During the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with Spartacus, only a thousand flight attendants were involved, with a standard of 9,000.
Spartakov fans were given 2,200 seats, 10 percent of the stadium's capacity, but were sold 5,000 tickets by agreement with the Moscow Club.
Arthur Grigoriantz, head of the FCC, read this information.
Americans eavesdropping on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the American intelligence services, who chose not to reveal his name, stated that the States were eavesdropping on telephone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several audition points in the rising sunland.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, reported NHK in spite of allied relations with Americans in the post-war period.
No official comment has yet been received from either party.
Let's remind you, the news of the U.S. intelligence surveillance of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany came out last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel's phone for the last 10 years.
The chancellor herself, according to some accounts, took the news of her wiretap very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed to be the FRG and the US for decades were unacceptable for such surveillance of the head of government.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was willing to share details about the telephone conversations of Angela Merkel with German prosecutors.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA employee.
Bashkiri can tender the grain not before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria, in the course of public procurement interventions, may tender the grain not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales into the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, it's demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be tendered after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that the current year ' s crop cultivation for 2013 was 3.1 million hectares, of which 1.7 million hectares were cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
In 2014, 550,000 hectares were planted (by 105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The squares have been increased to winter wheat and tritical, and the birth has remained at the same level.
There is no "Brat Circle" group in the Ministry of Internal Affairs bases that Leps was assigned to in the United States.
In the databases of Russian silovists of the Brad Circle, to which Washington has assigned the singer Gregory Leps, there is no record.
According to Interfax in the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, all databases have been checked after reports have appeared in the media that Gregory Leps, the U.S. Treasury, has entered control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brat Circle", but no such group has been found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, is regarded in the security forces.
"Even in the very name, 'Brat Circle', there's an element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very much like a PR campaign," said the agency's interviewer.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced that it had entered its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brat Circle" of Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lalina, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Schlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who have been considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps is "a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
At the producer's center, Gregory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "delusional."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama designated the Brad Circle as a "significant transnational organized crime group" and directed the Minfin to "fight and prohibit their global criminal operations".
The blacklisting of a person in an American mine has the effect of blocking his assets in the United States and banning his business contacts with people living in the United States.
Scandal video went to the police.
Toronto's head, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless stunts, got caught smoking crack.
The Canadian city police said they had a video and were ready to launch an investigation against the city chief.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reporting to CNN.
Information that the authorities had evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
Bill Blair, the head of the local law enforcement agencies, held a press conference on the subject.
The Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but that he was assured of their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford's compromise video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement guards in the summer of 2013.
The existence of the video had been previously reported by the Canadian press, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself makes no comment on this matter.
He's just saying it's not his fault and he's not gonna resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lisi, accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illicit profits, and criminal conspiracy.
Lisi sometimes acted as Rob Ford's driver.
The people of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He had repeatedly fought journalists, appeared in public in a drunken manner, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has been recognized by Rostovoeroinvest as the winner of a tender for the choice of the project's genetic designer.
The contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the State expert review in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport upgrading elements.
In the first phase of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, with the possibility of an increase thereafter.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the design document will take into account the prospects of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was finalized, the architectural concept of the South air station complex, developed by Twelve Architects, a British company, had been established.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Donu and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetievo International Airport and a new air station complex at Knevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksay District of Rostov province and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed down and eventually integrated into urban development.
Construction of the air station complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, and all facilities are scheduled to start in 2017.
A politician in Turkey went on a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of Nusaybin town in south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD Pro-Kurd Party spoke out against the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaybin Ayshe Hekhan, on the border with Syria, on hunger strike protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported to RIA News in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PFM) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed protests.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Muammer Güler, first denied the fact of construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"The Mayor of Nusaybina Ayeshe Hekhan, a member of the PDP, went on hunger strike, turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhuman situation that the Kurdishs will never agree to," is quoted by Aisha Hekhan of the party's representatives.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaybin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, the Bolívara, against the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported this with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of $10,000 a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country ' s bolívares at the time of departure.
The specific rate of bolívar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolívares per dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolívares.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolívar lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
On 18 October, the Minister of Petroleum Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolívar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to reduce the national currency following the municipal elections in December.
Policies to contain the prices of products and commodities of high consumption, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of a number of products and the operation of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of Southra, Andrei Belmach, noted that it was difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new chief coach.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it would take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, "ITARC-TASS says Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find some coach, but someone who's gonna work at our club for a few years and get some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: What can Parliament prevent the independence of the judiciary from being destroyed in the future?" reported the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media judiciary "will always be biased, as it is a continuation of government", and content and advertising restrictions will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to "take the media with a dead grip," and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "received a serious blow" and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at Westgate Trade Center.
The Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where the troops who had been sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted an expensive shopping centre.
The reaction of police chief David Kimayo was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass protests by the media.
Under the new law, publishers could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, with an additional risk of being "delisted", i.e. prohibited from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations".
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called live blogosphere.
Politicians realize that by silence, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote National Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
"The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenya's legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing the cuts appointed by the National Wages Commission and restoring their huge salary of some 532,000 shillings per month, which is tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new line of expenditure in the Vorones ' utility payments, which is for major repairs to the house.
Based on the best estimates, the standard two-room flat will have to pay between 100 and 400 rubles per month from the new year.
The Government of the region will define a precise standard.
But when you paint the entrance, clean up the stairwells, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klavnikov, Chairman of the Voronezhsky Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to establish order - to prioritize the renovation of houses, to accumulate funds not in the managing companies - which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be to establish State control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for the renovation of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the State, it is now joint construction.
The law protecting against fraud was approved by a clutter in final reading.
The document wasn't born empty.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by unfair developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the joint construction.
Vladimir Klavnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, stated: "It is no secret that abuses have also started in this area because the shareholders were the same in '98, and in the 2000s, the same shareholders."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including by adopting these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament had passed such a law not only under pressure from the federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region are worth the while.
In the past year, for example, a little over 100,000 foreigners had entered the migration register.
But only one in five has a formal work permit.
Where the rest of us work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klavnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They have broken the law but are not criminals."
There's no trial, and we have to deport them. We have to keep them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that, through regional means, such places should be equipped.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined as the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk District.
Well, last but not least, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families raising 5 or more children are exempt from transport taxes.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million, but so do parents with many children.
Secondly, and above all, those who adopt 3 or more babies will be granted housing subsidies from a new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
For example, a family of six — the father, the mother, the child, and the third — were adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires 108 square metres of housing, for 3 million 300 thousand roubles.
For the left bank or the southwest neighbourhood, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy an entire cottage at the Ridge Center for that amount.
Baumgertner is nominated to the board of directors of Uralcalya.
The current board of directors of the UAO, Uralkaly, has nominated the arrested CEO, Vladislav Baumgertner, in Minsk, for the new board, and is posted on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner joined the list of 11 persons nominated for the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for the extraordinary shareholders ' assembly on 29 November, at which a new board of directors will be determined by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his arrest in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
However, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenka, later stated at a press conference that the charges against Baumgertner had been reclassified to "theft".
Gateman Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's departure from his position as a mentor of the Lower Rocks.
The Golkyper believes that Acting Chief Coach Dmitri Balmin has a great deal of authority among the players and will be able to perform his duties.
Let's remind you, the oil chemist retired Creekunov today.
To be honest, I wouldn't like to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's dismissal, quote Dalton RIA News.
All I can say is that Dmitri Balmin can handle his responsibilities, which I have no doubt.
On the team, he has a great deal of authority, and this young expert certainly has a big future ahead of him.
"Juventus" defender Leonardo Bonucci won't help the team in the next Italian match with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coach's office decided not to include it in the game to save it before the fourth round of the League of Real Championship.
Nor will they fight with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quallarella recovered from the trauma and is ready to play.
A tax manoeuvre that includes an increase in the oil tax (NPI) on oil, coupled with a reduction in export duties and an increase in excises, will lead to an increase in fuel consumption.
In the view of the experts, these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.

U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies have sometimes gone too far in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that American intelligence agencies sometimes went "too far" when collecting data and wiretaps, but the politician noted that the news about the wiretapping that appeared in the media was not accurate.
I assure you that innocent people were not hurt in this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and was unlawful.
I admit it, as the president also admits... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," quote Secretary of State AFP.
Italian workers with years of experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment beats records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population were now unemployed.
This has not been the case since the Second World War.
Among young people, the rate is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
The country ' s largest energy company is already carrying out such an experiment, and the laws that have been adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for long-term employees.
On the other hand, Italy faces a common European problem of ageing populations.
And economists aren't sure if an idea with premature rotation of personnel is gonna work out.
The construction of TPVs in Moscow will lead to
Every year, the capital authorities promise to build more and more transport and transport hubs (TAPs).
It is planned to put 255 TPVs into operation before 2020.
What the project actually turns out to be, our reporter was looking into it.
A couple of months ago, the Smolenne subway of the Arbatsko-Pokrov line had a construction fence.
The inscription stated that a transport hub was under construction.
This was all very strange, as no ground transport stops near Smolen and therefore cannot be moved to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cross about 130 metres, including the ground crossing of the Carmanice alley.
Right now, Smolen's almost done.
The flower shop has disappeared, the newspaper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt has been replaced by a tarpaulin before the entrance.
There's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transport facilities can be flat and capital - explained by the Press Service of the Metropolitan Transport Department.
There's no capital TVU yet.
And the flats involve parking, the withdrawal of commercial objects that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, it is not even the transporters who handle flat TPVs, but the professional builders from the Moscow Capital Repair Department.
The transport hub, which is not necessarily a complex design, explains the director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough roofs and placards to indicate when the transport will arrive.
For example, the Jasenevo subway has recently opened a fully-fledged flat-plane transfer Node.
I'm not gonna have any curtains, but I'm gonna have a lot of parking and a sign to tell me when the bus is coming.
But in pursuit of the number, the officials write down everything in the TVU.
As early as 2011, the City Hall planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans for 2020 now include 255 TPVs.
One and a half of them are gonna give up this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of TSS, there are no qualitative criteria, notes Alexander Morozov, co-chair of City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplants at each site often deteriorates.
The criteria, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, reduced transplant time; secondly, comfort.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, the TPV sometimes comes out exactly the opposite.
That's a good example of the subway.
The suburban buses from the Jaroslav Highway used to come to the Square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now they've moved them to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the Cosmonaut Street.
Far from the subway, far further from the monorail, but closer to the homes.
It's a gift that residents didn't want the bus station under the windows and complained to every possible authority.
With the capital TPVs in Moscow, it didn't start at all.
The first one started building five years ago at the Planner subway.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And there's a really good example of how a transfer knot that's been bought out to investors turns into a platoon mall.
No, there's bus farts, a curtain to avoid the subway in the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
However, the number 202 and number 203 trolleybuses in Moscow's TPV did not have a place in principle.
They've been moved away from the subway like strangers.
But there are more places to trade.
There's only 32 store clothes, and there's almost all of them, from zootowers to autosalon.
In fact, what if one of the passengers on the bus needs to buy a new car on the road?
We always have a mall when we build a capital TSS.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot decided to market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planner" TPV, there's a brute trade among the semi-parked parking areas.
Vegetables, spice, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards looking at our photographer angry.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the Planner subway used to have a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the traders were sorry and let into the overtaking parking lot of a transfer hub.
Still, because of the high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was destroyed in order to build a new flat TPV.
That's the rocking.
The Calugsky subway had a distance of 50 metres from the subway lobby to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the mall, it is alleged that the TPV has increased its distance to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 22 hours when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on Planner and Kaluge will soon appear to be flowers.
In mid-September, the City Hall Urban and Land Commission approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPVs.
Four of them will be 25-story, apart from two or three underground longlines.
The main monster will grow up at the Tushino subway, with 418.7 thousand square metres of space.
Representatives of the RZR railway station directorate responsible for the construction of TPVs by the subway have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be available in the future.
In doing so, officials say that the multi-tiered parking lot is between one third and one half of the square.
Let's take the "people's" garage for example.
Let's say the 258-place garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 80 to 15 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 quadrants to park for 2,600 cars at Petrov-Zuzmovsky.
That's less than a third of the machine they're gonna build there.
Let's have one or two floors on all the bus farts.
At least 150,000 square metres of commercial property remains.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMs.
If railwaymen build the capital TPVs at stations and stations, the other sites will be taken up by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional objects", including hotels, offices, and even gymnasiums.
By the way, the Moscow Property Department recently told journalists that it was drafting a regulation that would allow investors to apply directly to officials for a TPV site.
No contests.
Because it said that transport issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TSS is, for example, Harvard Stations in Boston or Spadeina Station in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morosov.
There the trolleybuses and trams go underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway wagon to the tram is only 50 metres without going to the street.
There's no extra trade around here.
But Moscow's officials are out of line.
Either we build nothing, or we destroy 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to treat extremism as an insult to patriotic feelings.
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Justice Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to punish them for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legislative amendments, prepared by Oleg Miheev, Deputy to the Doum Committee on Energy, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and to the Government for an opinion.
By patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to mean an emotional relationship between a person and the country of which he is a national, characterized by love for that country, responsibility for its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, there are sanctions under domestic law for abuse of the formal features of State authority - flag and coat of arms.
However, in the view of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be hurt and insulted by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is not sufficiently developed in Russian law.
By way of example, he cited the debate that was taking place every year on the eve of Victory Day, when some media figures were allowing themselves to question the heroics of the people of the USSR in their struggle against fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the Victory Day of May 9th, a real Wachanalia is to take place every year.
By practicing wit and "alternative view" of history, some publicists have come to reason that it is a pity that cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I find this totally unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "soul-stamped" nation, which is outraged by Oleg Miheev.
Moreover, Miheev said that patriotic people in Russia were far more numerous than religious ones, but the law punished them for insulting the feelings of believers and insulting patriotic feelings could be almost with impunity.
In the opinion of the people ' s elector, it is necessary to equate the insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for the offence of insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100 to five years ' imprisonment.
The 6.6 magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, near the town of Coquimbo in central Chile, and is being transmitted by Reuters.
The quake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, and is updated on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website.
The shocks were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on 1 November in Moscow).
No casualties or subterranean shocks have yet been reported.
Again, Chile is located in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so earthquakes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history, with 9.5 magnets recorded there in 1960.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace will be heard fairly
On Friday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitrymedev announced that the Greenpeace case would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee adherence to the law," said Dmitry Medvedev in a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpease activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizan, like other activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted Mr. Ero's RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, no one can violate the law," Dmitrimedev stated.
He said that any structures that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "like a powder keg" and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, were transmitting RIA News.
The UN has announced new goals to overcome poverty.
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs due to expire in 2015, until the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the evening before.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the previous evening that it was now time to "be above national interests".
"I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and control the process of establishing universal sustainable development goals — SDGs", he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the successful achievement of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
At the top of the statue of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We Demand Security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital Area of Independence.
For two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been one of the most brutal clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era, as part of an effort to destabilize the country ' s independent Government.
After the 1992 Armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have caused anxiety among foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Fremmo Party, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo are accusing each other of creating tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government was the mastermind of the recent clashes, attacking its members in Sofala province, Renamo ' s traditional fortress, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times, Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebusa tried to dispel fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt "a loser" who wanted to use "all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government".
Both Fremmo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears have increased following reports that Mazanga has declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Fremimo party.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tensions that have been exacerbated by the series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have browsed," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The vote for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to resign next year when his second term ended, wished to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is not clear what Renemo is capable of, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Bayra, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renemo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted "to warn the international community that Mozambique is not doing very well," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the government's frustration, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, a protestor, said that people simply wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Fremmo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to roads," he said.
The Art Mainstream premiere series will take place in Moscow.
The film series "Art Mainstream", where the audience will be able to see one Russian film and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reporting to RIA News with reference to the organizers of the project.
Opens the Art Mainstream program to the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi, Paris at any cost.
This is a story about the French capital's Maya model (Kerichi's own), which is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Doek "Mibius" and the melodramatical biopic Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: a story of love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts as lead and lead film of the May Cannes Film Festival "The Life of Adele" by Abdelaltif Keshish.
The only Russian member of Art Mainstream will be Alexander Veledinsky's film, "Geographing the Globe" on the basis of Alexey Ivanov's novel.
The film featured Konstantin Habensky, a charming loser teacher, who was also awarded the "Cinosaur" prize.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models of a way of life," says the author.
The Torah could show that "brutal power cannot defeat sophisticated tricks," and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
To say that many myths will be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too indecent to be taught in schools", Crossley-Holland advocates "prudent selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I advocated their introduction into the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that "excessive morality" by authors and teachers "disturbed" children, and the basic ideas were "sublime" in fascinating stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from the English-Saxon language and wrote "Norwegian Myth Collection" for Penguin and "British People's Tales", said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And that should be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In the Voronezh region, a football fan was detained, breaking a window in the waiting room at the train station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans from the Moscow region were removed from the passenger train by the transport police at the Grozi-Voronezh station.
On their way to the game of their favorite team, the guys were making a drunken trip on the train.
Young people were taken to the on-call section of the Liner Police Department at the Dirty Station for a report of an administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police put administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets to the next train and began to wait for him to arrive at the train station.
At half the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window of the train station.
An officer of the transport police and a guard of the CDC "RZD" rang the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend an intruder who was trying to escape the scene.
The officers of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are conducting an inspection.
The question of the institution of criminal proceedings is under consideration, and a senior referee of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation informed Sergei Olkhovik of the communication and public relations concerning the transport of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we've been back 15 years.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, expressed his opinion on the riots at the stands during the Russia Cup match Shinnick-Spartacus.
I'm in favour of being responsible for all this by the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone from the outside to come and clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite the right one.
We have to organize the fans, the clubs have to invite their flight attendants, not let the case go on its own.
We have now drawn up a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it's accepted, we'll take care of it.
But I'm gonna have to ask all the football organizers to join me.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state, say, give the law quickly.
It's like the Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl are here and they're all set up.
And we're outsiders.
In fact, it's awful to see the stand water from the fireplace.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10, 15 years," said Mutko.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia.
A former U.S. intelligence officer, Edward Snowden, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify in the telephone-tapping cases of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As "Interfax" said on Friday to a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from representatives of the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in private in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure outside Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by U.S. allies," said the agency's interviewee.
"In addition, in principle, the General Secretariat of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia could send representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the matter should be developed at the inter-State level.
Previously, a German Bundestag deputy, Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case concerning the wiretap by the US intelligence services of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German territory.
A CIA ex-boyfriend made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined," reported Shtrebele to Euronews.
Snouden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of Interfax's source, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about secret surveillance operations by U.S. intelligence agencies on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the United States authorities, who had made serious allegations in absentia, and remained in the transit area of Sheremetievo Airport until the beginning of August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum on Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sheremetievo on the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client was employed by a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported to the German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor's phone calls began to be auditioned as early as 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing the information, stated that the surveillance of Merkel violated German law and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Justice Russia.
A member of the State Duma from the Justice Russia Party, a member of its office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he filed an application with the Party ' s Novo-Siberian Regional Office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of "justices".
We're sitting here drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Ilya Ponomarev puts on the table, but there is nothing so landmark about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the Regional Office of the Esers.
In the meantime, Ilya Ponomarev, a deputy of the State Duma, has no intention of relinquishing his mandate.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not legally leave the party.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
Dmitri Houdkov and Valeri Zubov were reported to be leaving the "SR" with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fumio Kisida, met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
Japan ' s Foreign Minister recalled that since Japan ' s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today to demand that the land lost after the Second World War be restored to the country.
There are cars in the Japanese capital that say on the loudspeaker, "Return the northern territory!"
The police don't stop protesters, they make sure they don't exceed the noise level.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
You can safely say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the singer Frank Faye, who worked as a conferenceist at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's innovation has over time been picked up by others, just recently by the New York comedy festival.
Created and sponsored by Caroline Hersch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"The majority of these headliners started at the Carolines, and then made more progress, reaching a level when they were already too famous to perform at the club," Hersch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as "Stendup for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others, will appear.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example through small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for playing in a comedy show on a little-known cable television channel (punctured the FXX Scene League on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast both on Saturday night live and on Parks and Rest Zones, although she is best known for the series of viral "Marsel - Rock in Shoes".
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians in their own style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a leper, racially focused Camau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful television director and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy" with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the centerpiece of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked around some street between the two houses and thought, "If I don't have any money, maybe I'll live here."
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the British Embassy, where Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting.
The Head of Government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Prime Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun," said the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said he hoped and prayed that dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same-name Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
Earlier, the Government of Islamabad had attempted to enter into negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities took the troops deployed in the Taliban areas to permanent locations and also released the arrested Islamists from prison.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil dropped to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large reserves were eclipsed by a report showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The US reference oil in the December shipment was 14 cents, with a price of $96.24 per barrel later in the morning in European electronic bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was 39 cents, which represented a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
The wealth of oil has affected the cost of oil in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been added.
But on Friday, there was a reference to a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery can continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the twenty-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent's oil, the reference type of international oil used by the United States oil refineries as well, has paid 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Chief Colorado Colorado coach Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the Golkyper Semen Varlamov from the first minute on Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars hadn't shaken his confidence in the Russian, transmitting from Dallas S.E.S. to Natalia Schmelev.
Why should we wait, said Rua after the morning roll of Lavin?
Of course, what has happened concerns us all, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be useful for him to come out on ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're pretty sure the situation hasn't affected the gatekeeper's condition?
We'll see about that today.
There is no doubt that our players will support Varli by helping him protect the gate, as was the case in previous games of this season.
The important thing is that no one on the team is going to draw any conclusions until this situation is resolved by the court.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be a vegan: a warm tomato won't replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism isn't suitable for living in Siberia, RIA News reporter found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal food should not live in Siberia.
They will not be able to survive the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate for them, as the New Siberian dietists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day view.
Drink butter in litres
Strict vegetarianism, where not only meat and fish are abandoned but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable lifestyle.
However, dietologists believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, maintaining such strict nutritional standards is not at least healthy.
Total abandonment of animal food is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with plant acids.
You have to put milk or eggs in the diet," nutritionist Marina Bogai, I'm sure.
She gives an example of fish containing indispensable fatty acid Omega-3.
His most rich vegetable oil is linen oil.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for man, you have to drink in litres!" says the nutritionist.
Medical doctors believe that the people of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly called into question.
In our realities, there are high requirements for food.
It takes more calories to keep it cold.
"If a person limits himself to animal food, therefore, he misses this calorie," says a specialist.
Olga Pozniak, a nutritionist, agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the answer.
It is better for a person to eat mainly food that is grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed for better learning and digestion of these products.
In the winter, people want to eat a hot soup or something nicer," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, a variety of grains, porridges, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But that is clearly not enough to feed.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the vitamin levels in the body were sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural environment, where the temperature can change by 30 degrees in 24 hours and the snow lies in May, is not appropriate.
The body needs energy to live, and this is above all fat," the medic says.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them to the inferiors.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get them," I'm sure.
Arifulina says that a grown man is free to choose whatever he wants to play the toys he wants.
He's got a formed body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet, children must eat fully.
If the parents deny him some micronutrients or amino acids, choosing what he'll eat for him, it's just a violation of a child's rights.
"The lack of any substance for the development of the brain, the eyes, the bones are no longer restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree on the poor quality of the winter growing in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients than the ones we need in the open soil.
"The quality of the food is wrong," says the God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes producers' desire to collect more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, tomatoes tasteless and non-aromatic," gives examples of medics, adding that they are likely to be filled with excessive fertilizer.
And they're not suppliers of vitamins, they're suppliers of fibres.
This is not in agreement with the sub-laboratory of the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Physics and Technology, Vera Petruk, a candidate for agricultural science.
She said that full-scale vegetables could be grown in greenhouses with the right approach and compliance with all standards and requirements.
If you try to drive more from a square metre, you will, of course, water more often, and feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grew rapidly, they were large but watery and unweak," she explained, adding that quality was primarily a matter of conscience on the part of the manufacturer.
The Court suspended the execution of the "stop-and-search" decision at the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the "stop-and-search" programme of the New York Police Department and suspended the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the city ' s appeal.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by carrying out a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change the practice and the related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' deliberations on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to challenge the judge because she had violated the U.S. judge code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid a demonstration of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements providing a public response to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably turning to black and Latino under the "stop-and-search" programme.
It appointed an external supervisor to oversee major changes, which include policy, training and monitoring reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras in police stations where most arrests take place.
In August, New York had decided to discontinue the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases had been discontinued after police checks.
The debate on the city ' s appeal is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
"Stop and search" tactics have been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The stop-search has been practised for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, the majority of whom are black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a class action with the court.
Proponents of the "stop-and-search" programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to bad practices, create a more reliable and effective police service and may affect the way in which other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police rather than the crime rate, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions, owing to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not cease the practice of "stop-and-search", which was constitutional, but changed the way the NYPD stopped people.
In the area of the Third-Kow Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third-Kow Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokouznetski subway station to the Bolot Square.
Street torthers, florists, benches, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been installed all along.
In addition to the Clementovsky and Lavrushinian alleys, which were already footpathic, five streets were closed to vehicles, namely the Ordean impasse, the Great and Little Tolmachew alleys, the Kadashev coast and the Boloty Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the Friday street section from the lobby of the Novokosuznetski station to the Clementow alley, pedestrian conditions were created without the removal of traffic and the cutting of the carriageway, transmitting newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Third-Kow Gallery, the temple of the Holy Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments, and other sights.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the Stolen alleys, and the street of the Kuznetsk Bridge became fully pedestrian.
A large Dmitration, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, was decided to close vehicles on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked a phone to check a confidential message.
Former editor of News of the World's Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke's affair, then Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, King's Counsel Andrew Edis, informed the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World had received inaccurate news that Clark was meeting with her "attractive special counselor" Hanna Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkeir to hack Paulby's voicemail and sneaked around to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, and heard the court.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand by someone's house hoping to surprise someone, he is the man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the other one, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone break-in?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumors of Clarke's novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A tape with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkeira's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found footage on a private detective's computer in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects".
During the period of surveillance, Ms. Polby ' s grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're planning to publish tomorrow, which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's involvement in the story had followed the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanket about an affair with a married woman while he himself was meeting with a defendant, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to conspire with other people to break into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkyre, Turlbeck and Wezerap confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden says he's willing to talk to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the wiretap case.
A CIA agent, Edward Snowden, is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and meet with representatives of the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, and transmits RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the deputy of the Bundestag, Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, through which Snowden delivered a message to the German authorities.
Schtrebel met Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on Tver Street
Four passers-by were injured as a result of the fire at the manifold in the centre of Moscow, on Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by were injured during a fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA News, with reference to Paul Livinsky, head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, electricity has now been fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat manifold near house 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was heavy smoke from the storm sewer hatches, and smoke was applied to the underground subway at the Armania store.
11 houses on Tver Street were disabled as a result of the fire.
At 9:45 p.m. Moscow time, the fire was removed.
US cuts the food aid for the poor
Food allowance for four-person family is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the U.S. has been reducing the financial provision of food stamps, known as "foodthamps", as the relevant government program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now receive $36 less per month than in the past, which is spoken by officials.
It will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the allowance per person averaged $133 per month.
Expenditure on food aid in the US rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans have been relying on free food aid for "foodthamps" that has been named since the old days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, demand further cuts in the resources allocated to the programme, saying that it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food shop owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how government funding can be further reduced.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer free of charge.
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge.
WOW Insider reports it.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the Blizzard section of the classic games.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts relate to the American part of the service can download it at present.
The game is also not yet available to Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, released 19 years ago by Blizzard, originally appeared on the SNES consoles.
Its events took place on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler of Sarlac decided to kill the good King of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight with Sarlak's followers and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
There's gonna be new subway machines in Moscow.
But they're not selling tickets to passengers for money, they're selling tickets for sitting down.
One trip worth 30 rubles would cost a potential passenger in 30 sittings.
The number of sittings will be counted using modern technologies, and ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
The President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic champions of the Alexei Nemov gymnasts, and Elena Zaylotchik, will host the presentation.
The National Security Agency ' s acknowledgements reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to State surveillance
On a warm day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew low over the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the Federal Constitutional Defence Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission Building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say BfV was hoping to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of U.S. National Intelligence, again in September, assured that the U.S. was not using foreign intelligence "to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or their profits".
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a exposer, began publishing his treasurer of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted on his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency was following the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by United States cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged for maybe about ten years.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is intense cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it's quite likely that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grune, president of BITMI, who represents the small and medium-sized IT companies of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY Consulting Agency.
In all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, there is still no evidence that the US has transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers expressed concern that the EU lacked certain information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Somebody in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it shouldn't have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everyone except the IT industry.
And yet, the reach and technological development of US spying agencies, known by Snowden's revelations, were a shock to some companies that had previously thought China was the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company leaders have become more aware that data stored in the US are under the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-United States participants have abandoned plans to use a cloud provider in the United States after exposing the American program for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneib, one of SAP's executive directors, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't come up a year ago, namely, where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are just proof of what they already knew: the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place.
It's always happened.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we are spying on them, too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to boast about the response they've taken, because it might give the enemy an advantage.
The idea of taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room has long been learned.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi automotive company, said that it had been standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Defence Service recommends that company leaders consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to forced entry and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
"Little and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," BfV warns.
The US alerts its own companies to economic espionage by other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France with Russia and Israel in the second series of perpetrators of economic intelligence hacking after China, claiming the Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services know very well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a Georgia teenager who died in an "unbelievable accident" believe that their son was murdered.
The parents of the Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a deposed sports mat in his high school gym, believe that their son was murdered, told the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the State of Georgia Waldosta, was found on January 11, in a vertical matt tied behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
The Loundes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a tragic accident, but that the family of a 17-year-old boy was disputing it.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com, Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
"They think it's against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," said Kramp.
They think it's a cover for protecting the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they come from.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial autopsy revealed that Johnson had died as a result of "positional asphyxiation".
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
"There are a few issues to be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Loundes County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the authorities to publish all the video footage of the surveillance cameras that investigators were watching.
The teenage parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to solving how he died.
"Spartacus": For information on the individuals who posted the fascist symbols
On the official website of Spartacus, the Moscow Club announced the appearance of a fascist flag at the Jaroslavla rostrum.
"In the Shinnik Cup match, "Spartacus" on October 30th, unknown provocateurs at the Jaroslavla stadium showed fascist symbols.
We ask all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
"Rewards are guaranteed," says the application.
Looking for fans who posted the fascist flag in Jaroslavla.
It will be recalled that in the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup, Shinnick-Spartacus was interrupted several times because of the riots at the stands.
Also in the Spartacus fan sector, fascist symbols were displayed.
As punishment, Spartacus can hold about three matches without an audience.
The Committee will meet on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried and posted this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations to schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children ' s schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of nutritional allergy among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff about the nutritional allergy of children and how to assist in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep a stock of adrenaline — most commonly the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to assist with potentially lethal anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Kids can say, "It feels like something's poking into my language," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue" or "the tongue is pinching."
Parents of intersex children may choose "undefined sex"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate external sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to identify sex as "undefined" or "undefined" in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to relieve parents who could make hasty decisions on the operation of newborn sex and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I am not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna stay a doctor-made braid with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexity, one of about 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as "sexually impaired", a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonades (ovaries or seeds) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still underexplored, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use and embezzle all available information than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not," he said.
You can embezzle the floor without surgery and then see how the personality evolves.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a riddle about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as distinct from transgender or transgender people, as their condition was not gender-related but their biological structure, which was not exclusively male or female, but typical of both at the same time or not.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and build; primary sex, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomes and hormone structures.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "sexless", claiming in court the right to retain "undefined" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F - X, which is intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning the other two pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have the children have sex at birth.
"It is difficult enough to have a child without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said to the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs have been called hermaphrodites — by the name of a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a leaf to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an "urgent psychiatric emergency", Dresser said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Maney of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents raise a child — interacted with the child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision to castrate the child completely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not," Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that now some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-shifting operations declared themselves "disgruntled by the result".
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but intermediate type genitals.
Doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external sexual organ and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
He was given hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned vaginaplastics.
But being depressed and realizing something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone shots and removing his breasts.
The operation made him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring the perception of people with intersexity to standard.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law "instills labels and stigma".
"A lot of activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child an "undefined sex", she said.
We're afraid he'll facilitate intervention.
We think it's better to take a male or a female and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will prove itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because "it allowed adults to choose a third sex".
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she said.
German law implies her attribution at birth.
It is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist mammologist from Pittsburgh, who has a sexually impaired daughter who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would "support" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called "the complete insensitive anddrogen syndrome".
Because her androgic receptors are not working properly, Kathy has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is receiving a residency degree in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestation surrogacy.
" The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves, " said Baratz.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, as well as the length of time before they write "male" or "female".
In that case, you're fine — raising a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that parents have because they don't feel they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that's wonderful.
This allows children to make their own decisions.
"Chicago" gatekeeper Nikolai Habibulin pointed out that he realizes he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two Hawks meetings, Habibulin first missed six hits from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed to do so, the CSNhicago says Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in my training, and I should probably approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good at training.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
I don't think I'm the only one who's always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss that much puck.
It's nice to have my one-club support, but it's basically simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
There's a bus on Altay.
In the Rubtsov district of Altai province, a PAZ bus was rolled over.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reported to have been injured and reported to the Regional Office of the MES.
The region ' s law enforcement agencies previously reported 10 victims.
According to the department, the accident took place around 9 a.m. local time on the No novikovka - Vishnevka road, 1 kilometre from Nonikolaevka.
The bus from Rubtsevsk to Vishnevka had 12 passengers and a driver, all injured in various degrees and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were transferred to City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsovsk and two were hospitalized at the Rubtsovska CRS.
Bears expect the SSJ-100 aircraft to arrive in Europe.
Russia expects that when the Superjet 100 aircraft are established in the markets of Latin America and Asia, so will Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such arrangements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," quoted "Interfax" the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitrymedev at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Aero.
The Head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French counterparts, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will one day be sent to France," the Russian premier stressed.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by the civil aircraft of Sukhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Lyner is developed using modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger seats.

In the old days, in order to be brought to the court of the stork, the villagers placed a wheel from the cart on a high pillar, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special poles are long overdue, so the storks have loved electricity poles — the interlocked branches rely on wires, making the aesthetic house reliable.
Anja's grandmother, who had been living in the village of Ivanovka of Petrikov for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer's already in between the wires, about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity to have a family of storks who've been nesting at the door every year, taking out and feeding three or four chicks over the summer, but you don't want to be left out of the light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm places, Anja's grandmother called the Carican RET, which owns the support.
I didn't even expect it to react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding up," said Dr. Sergei Berezovsky, Technical Director of DTEK, "Dneprooblainergo".
Corrosion began on the wires, which were in fact already inside a nest weighing 150 - 200 kilos.
At any moment, the birds could have died from electric shocks.
And the locals risked losing light because of the damage to the wires.
So the linear monters started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the National University of Dnipropetrovsk helped to develop a set-up for nest transfer.
They also conducted training sessions for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, a well - known ornithologist in Dongpropetrov, provided advice to the energy industry at all stages of the nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 aesthetic "rents" in an emergency state.
Special metal platforms resembling a vortex have been boiled for their reconstruction.
The base was splintered with willow branches and then moved into an old nest.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Sandshank of the Novomoskov district.
A new reinforced concrete pole was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old nest that was already living on it was placed on it.
The entire operation cost 9,000 hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka of Petrikov district on the suburb of Anja's grandmother.
This is where the platform was fixed, just lifted above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their apartment has undergone major repairs.
The same reconstruction is expected to take place before the end of the year in four more nests in the Pokrov and the Caričan districts of Dniprotestvina.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The other day, the whole area was covered with the sad news of the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic District, the day the pheasant hunt was discovered, and poachers shot down a swan family living on a local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of the people, but the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the gunshots, they ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
The Apostolic District Police Department is now investigating who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On 4 November, the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will host the Russian March.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian March is increasing - 40 per cent of citizens have given varying degrees of approval to the idea.
According to Levada Center, 40 per cent of citizens have different degrees of approval for the Russian March, of which 11 per cent are definitely positive and 29 per cent are "early positive".
The popularity of the Russian March is gradually increasing - in 2006 only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed it, and in December 2010 twice as many citizens (28 per cent) supported such events.
"Definitely negative" refers to "Russian Marshs" only 7% Russians, "shorter negative" 19% Russians.
A further 35 per cent were unable to formulate their attitude to the action.
This year, the city of Moscow agreed on a "Russ March" of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, as reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majoor.
This action by nationalists has been held every year on the Day of People ' s Unity since 2005.
In response to a question from social scientists, "Have you heard that Russian marches are being held on 4 November in Russia under the slogans of defending Russian rights in Russia?" Three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Only 1 in 5 Russians (20%) now know about this action.
It is noteworthy that nearly one third of citizens (31 per cent) heard about the Russian March in December 2010.
Three years ago, on 11 December, a spontaneous nationalist rally was held in Manego Square, which turned into a riot.
Levada Center also asked the Russians about the celebration of 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (People ' s Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens are invited to celebrate the holiday.
About as many as (17%) intend to celebrate October Revolution Day on 7 November.
Most of the citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How did the city hall of Moscow agree on a Russ March in Lublino?
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Lublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian association, the organizer of the Dmitry Demushkin march.
In addition to the Lublino march, a rally and a rock concert of the Kolovrat group, also agreed with the authorities, will be held on the Day of People's Unity.
How was the Russian March 2012?
On the 2012 People ' s Unity Day, the nationalists held a march from the Yakimana Waterfront to the Central Painting House, where a rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000, the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the figure of 6,000.
Message: Obama's election headquarters was considering Biden's exclusion for Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to President Barack Obama were secretly considering replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral roll.
This discovery is the brightest sensation in all of Mark Galperin and John Heilemann's expected book on the 2012 campaign "Stavks Double: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book being prepared for release and reported on Thursday evening that the president's closest aides had conducted "large-scale studies in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise the declining hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political columnist The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by high-ranking campaign officials and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice-President on the vote.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, Obama's former head of election headquarters, Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers, David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book "Stavks Doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their "near personal relationship", but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "improve Obama's chances significantly".
In an interview with Martin Daley, the administration confirmed that it was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I was very much in favour of considering a lot of things, and that was one of them," said Daley to the newspaper.
You should remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?"
Although Daley described the study as "a necessary test," Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the election staff had invested quite a lot in examining whether that step would bring dividends to the vote.
"Pre-election headquarters don't spend that kind of money on interviews and focus groups unless they're serious about something," said Martin in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had explored the possibility of replacing him.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible scam.
Although Daley said he didn't think that the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that "maybe" Obama knew.
Martin added that "The Stavks are doubled" did not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political sensing had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the study of Biden's de-election list.
"Perhaps," said Martin.
Would you like a glowing ice cream in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first sunning ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising pH in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lisney Me, I Taste, says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning of the production, so you'll get about 2 g of substance for £200."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it will increase pH and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and sauce gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refractation caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent jellyfish properties synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangarda coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to his team's preparations for the regular KHL against Salawat, noted that the Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the magnetic Metallurg.
The specialist stressed that Avangardo needs to pay more attention to the defense game.
We watched a video match against the magnetic "Methallurg", which is the official "Avangard" site of Chebaturkin's word.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because they didn't do the game assignment.
We knew the opponent had performers.
According to the statistics, they had five hits on the way-- three pucks beat us up.
Very good implementation.
Have these mistakes been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
Me and the guys are going through every game, talking after the game, getting ready for a new rival.
The important thing is that the installation is done.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game assignment was done, and the score was 2 to 0.
We missed the goal "in the locker room" and we started making mistakes in the third period.
Given how difficult the game was, I didn't see any point in connecting the defenders.
It's up to the whole team.
Now, Avangard has a long home series, matches go on in a day-- the team gets tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
What matters now is the implementation of your moments and the execution of your game assignment.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you're running a setup, it's not that complicated.
Because of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been in line at the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotuals.
Hundreds of furs gathered at the border crossing points into Russia.
This situation arose from changes in the customs regulations for the discharge of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the Russian side is creating a turn that did not give advance warning of innovations.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of East Customs.
The new model is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The points of entry are operated in a high-intensity mode.
FACTOV's respondent visited the border and contacted truckers who were held hostage.
Prices at the road cafe at the Novoazovsk pass point are rising every day, as is the line from the truck.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Novozovsk-Veselo-Vozenska Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on an international motorway.
This is where the cargo is sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, and after the introduction of these rules, Alexey Golovanov (in photo), who is transiting through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has spent almost a week in his car, complains.
By the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and freight insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance to which it is taken.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who are not far (say Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass through.
And the rest of them are stuck, because nobody has that big money with them!
Can you imagine if the driver is carrying only $4,000 worth of cargo to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - none - are complained by truckers who eat near their cars.
Border shops and cafes are always expensive, but we've never seen prices like this!
The salesmen were oriented and quickly whipped up: 15 hryvnias are worth a bath, seven hryvnias are a cup of coffee, and 25 hryvnias are a bowl of soup.
There's only one cafeteria.
And there's no bathroom.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No bathing, no shaving...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife made it for me on the road.
For a week, another trucker, Victor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Only, will my car get the line in a week?
How many liters of water do you have?
There's 11 and 15 hryvnias.
Is the bottle crystal or is the water permanent on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the saleswoman's steaming.
The plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region after the situation began to be covered in the media.
The leadership of the Amvrosiyyiv and Novoazovsky Raggodist administrations has been instructed to provide all those waiting in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblage Administration, Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are now on duty at the points of entry.
Biotuals will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the list of issues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Obligatory Administration, as at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been parked at the Usenka and Novoazovsk international access points, respectively.
The "facts" will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made by the BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic (DHS).
This information is available on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskait, and publish forged documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchy, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence services, an information attack is being prepared by the Department for the Analysis of Public Administration Processes of the Russian President ' s Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The entity is headed by Evgeny Umerkov, who has visited Lithuania on numerous occasions and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
An officer of the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the intelligence agency, Smirnov, undercover, regularly visited Lithuania until the end of 2012, in contact with local politicians, political scientists and the media.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
The previous day, the President of Lithuania, Gribauscate, had announced that she knew of the information being prepared for her.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and its "aim for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on more than one occasion.
Thus, she claimed that Lithuania was "underrespected" in the Kremlin.
Moreover, Gribauscate accused Vladimir Putin, head of the Russian Federation, of bringing "only demands" to Lithuania.
In September, Rossimnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the country's Government should prepare an application to WTO.
In the United States, the principal of the school fired on teenagers.
The principals of an American high school were literally desperate.
The man said he had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the Director ' s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
Note that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California on the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, shots were fired at Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mom worked at school, and she was a teacher.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a scrub.
I haven't shown up in the last two years handing out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't be here this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow in relation to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation projects a costume of $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we're gonna see a lot of zombies with "The Walking Dead," and I'm sure the Daft Punk astronauts are gonna get into our Instagram ribbons this year.
According to Google, the costumes most commonly sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
There's probably nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't change.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, candy candy, Milk Duds, chewing candy Twizzlers, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children who need candy who are prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — and we will not deceive ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Barbery Association, almost 35 million pounds of it is sold as Halloween.
These are about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween like a haunted house.
They have amazing names, such as "The Horror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Voice and Cry" and "House of Shock".
Moreover, according to American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing pictures where you almost peed on your friend's Facebook, and you can't take it out, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "a great look on your face."
And in conclusion, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like an ornament of the Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, it wasn't until last year that Pinterest started the baby in the pumpkin, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's light, slowly drying up on your porch, is likely to come from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want to do harder tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2032 pumpkins.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site recovered from the attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been re-established following the morning cyber attack, as reported by the agency ' s press service.
According to the Vice Chancellor of the Department of Defense for Information and Administration, Tymar Petercop, it was a primitive attack, and the site was just overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our specialists have quickly established everything, and so far the site has been restored.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petercop to Postimees.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who staged the attack.
"We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely," he admitted.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted an online address confirming the hacker attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine previously reported that a company of Marines of the Feodosian stand-alone battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps would take part in command and staff exercises of NATO Response Forces Steadfast Jazz 2013.
Owing to the fighting of unclean force, several schools and the hospital had to be shut down.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's province of South Matabelland had to close because the students were attacked by... Goblins.
According to the local elder, the children panicked, and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's fiction for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing a school.
Adults too are afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital closed in Zimbabwe because the medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
The Land Rover series has been announced.
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Advanced brakes, a service package that provides access to Bauler Works mechanics, logistical support, and storage of the car between events can be added.
Drew Bauler, managing director of Bauler Motorsport, said, "Bowler band members have changed.
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the harsh conditions and realities of the Rally Ride.
We were very happy to develop the Defender Challenge car, which will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian silovists don't know anything about the Brats Circle - New Izves
It is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the Russian law enforcement agencies.
"After reports in the media of Leps's entry into the U.S. Treasury's control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brat Circle', we looked at all the databases, but no such group was found," said the agency's interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of the information contributed to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operated abroad.
As previously written "NI", yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the Brat Circle criminal group.
Among them was a Russian singer, Grigory Leps.
He's on the list as Grisha, posted the previous day.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, a creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR whose citizenship is not specified.
The U.S. believes that Grigory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was transporting money for bandits on their orders.
A photograph of the singer is attached to the present report and all his data, which are valid, are included.
In fact, Leps did buy a house on Phuket recently.
The agency indicated that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps's assistant, Maya Serikov, stated that no notice was given to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's the Grigory that everyone's talking about now in connection with the U.S. scandal."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I don't know if they happen in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all funny on the one hand, and it's amazing and unexpected on the other," she said RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps doesn't live on Phuket, but according to the US Department, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him on a flight to the city of Bognordensk.
Runner in the field in the Shinnick match.
Some details of the fan who ran out to the field during the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between Jaroslav's Shinnick and Moscow's Spartacus have become known.
As stated by the head of the FRC, Arthur Grigoriantz, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the fan is a Moscowian.
He's in custody at the moment.
"In addition to this, Grigorianz described how a fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, we call him an spectator, went to an ambulance accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He went to the E.R. - the E.R. confirmed it to us.
And then he pushed away two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran across the field.
It's the flight attendant's responsibility.
Pending the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is an area of flight attendant activity - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, climbed over the Eastern rostrum.
And at that time the riots began on the Eastern rostrum and on the treadmills," said the head of the KDC.
Let us recall that by the decision of the KDC, Moscow's Spartacus will hold the upcoming matches of Russia's 15th tournament against Locomotiva and Zenita, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
Fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous quarry.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran away after she had a little accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog noticed her stuck in a quarry.
Firefighters came down on a rope on the back slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky enough to be saved after the fire brigades were called up to pick him up and get him to a safe place, after he somehow got stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the back slope.
Ruby's nine-month-old coker-spaniel ran away from a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her masters, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappet's quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked West Yorkshire fire and rescue service.
They scrambled for their missing dog and posted messages on social media sites after she ran off into a quarry after a small accident.
At around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a dogman saw Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet on a quarry.
The technical rescue team from the Clekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transport to lift her up the slope.
The rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, "She was in a dangerous situation."
It was right in the middle of the slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move the muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Rubi is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and it was determined that she was okay, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, Western Yorkshire, said: "The watch for salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we had it back in our hands.
The vet said that if she was exhausted and unconscious, she'd probably fall.
The fire department was great.
It was very brave — what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitty added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire department was amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he wasn't flirting with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview in an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a back-up vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habitats die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a rocker veteran, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of 70-year-old Jagger said that he "corridly denies that he ever hit Katie Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scottishs a choice
Another day, another scarecrow for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
The story of passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Adrian berm is emerging.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movements across the rest of Europe, although — predictable — this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as conveniently as they are.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen zone, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels, instead of what he really wanted from the Scottishs.
So it's an unattractive story.
And it's so old that it's become a fossil: it's the first time I've heard the "truth" that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the re-story of an old fairy tale.
Why does an independent Scotland have to do what Europe commands?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, the Europa project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or to the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the party of Euroskeptics, "Alternative for Germany", founded only this year, emerged from nowhere and obtained almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively replacing "Free Democrats" (the same as our "Liberal Democrats") from the Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to believe that the "Europe" project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working against excessive budget deficits — it was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a pre-existing disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only lifesaving measure is to cut salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current fiscal and currency problems is the deeper problem of Europe ' s productive capacity.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels — a code that means subsidies to French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the US.
It's a paralysingly unfavourable price environment, as we've seen in Grangemouth.
No freeze in the world will stop the US cheap shale gas from winning the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a mutiny, especially in France, once the most violent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destroyed French economy in distress.
The result is the right-wing anti-EU party, Marin Le Pen's National Front, which has just won decisive by-elections, leaving the ruling socialist party in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of the vote — a timely warning to British Laborists that it cannot be assumed that division among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity in the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: Soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the common currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become a sort of vague "Europe (Sovereign) Nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I suppose Britain will distance itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain is likely to be neglected in the cold of the Atlantic.
What position does that leave Scotland in?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect Scotland will succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party Government in Scotland is, strangely enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which won an impressive majority of votes in 2011, thanks to objections to the cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and subsequently formed by the Tory and Liberal Democrats coalition.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Sexual Maturity: Ageing Before
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers do research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that obesity can be one of the triggers for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etherage is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter begins to develop breast and pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Paediatric Academy this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents — usually this does not mean the rapid onset of full puberty," said Kaplovitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls' lives.
But there's only been a small shift at the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"After breast development, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Sexual Maturity of Girls: How to deal with this widespread problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered to be "early", when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or slow down — that the pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster progress can be used as a basis for endocrinologist tests to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures in place to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which may eventually lead to slow growth and low growth at mature age.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is careful with her medication, but recognizes that "sexual maturation can alleviate behavioural problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from their peers".
Another big problem is that parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or even how they handle hygiene issues," said Caplovitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other foodstuffs, environmental chemicals or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have early puberty.
Caplovitz claims that the condition that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links the amount of fat in the body to puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
All over the world, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
The mystery is that although boys have hair on their faces and pubics at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of pubic pimples and pubic hair can occur even in infants and children of child-bearing age.
"We must be careful how we determine the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean an earlier conversation than expected," Caplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who thrive early on need confirmation that even when this occurs before what is due, it is a normal part of life.
Stuck in Chita, American Boeing is preparing for departure.
In the framework of the Open Skies Treaty, observation flights over Russian territory and an unscheduled United States aircraft landing at Chita on Wednesday, Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m. Moscow time, will leave the city ' s air harbour.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take off with the fuel money.
According to the airport, the plane will leave for Ulan Udeh.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
It was reported that a plane flying to Ulaanbaatar had landed in the Zabaikal region because of fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita Airport.
The aircraft has 30 passengers, including a crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reporting to ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, persons on board aircraft are not entitled to travel outside Chita airport, but only at two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan Udeh.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and 34 States are parties to it.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, enhance capacity for crisis prevention and crisis management within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the dead celebrities earn - MK in the U.S. MK.
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But her late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income was 160 million between October 2012 and October 2013, had "oversold" her.
He is far behind in his life by other celebrity who earned a few times less money last year.
The second to be listed by Forbes was 55 million in a year, and the author of the Peanuts comic books, Charles Schultz, with 37 million, was named below.
They included Elizabeth Taylor, former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
In Moscow, the first boutique of Igor Guliayev opened.
On 23 October, the first flagship boutique of Igor Guliaev was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igor Guliaev is known to the general public for his excellent products from the suite class.
And now they can appreciate even more fashion fans -- his first boutique finally opened in Moscow, about which the designer threw a dolce vita party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
That's what Igor cut the red ribbon with and invited everyone who wanted to... try on the models he liked!
The jet manufacturers are hostile about the width of the seat when large orders are at stake.
A violent dispute over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-distance flights between the leading aircraft manufacturers set the tone for violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-distance flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the airline ' s concerns, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would have a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class salons, but its main American competition, Boeing, says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and the event on 17-21 November is expected to produce potentially record orders.
The assembly of the back of the plane — especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row — is central to the statements of cost-effectiveness of the new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 persons, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches wide, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class on seats 18 inches wide, 9 in rows.
Aeroplane giants often exchange technical strikes through advertising in the professional press.
Airbus now addresses the public directly in front of the Dubai air show, where 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could begin by showing financialists a slide depicting three people in a restaurant held together, called "Would you agree to this?"
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in seats that are narrower than those of regional turbovant aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Lihi.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-fuse Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the border of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist of the 21st-century average American male is 39.7 inches, according to the U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitors adhere to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist grip of those recently called "reactive public" was already there.
Airbus says she commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in the seat width improves sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing contests the Airbus numbers by seat size and says that producers should not interfere with decisions about how airlines can balance tariffs with convenience.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the passenger compartment does not depend solely on the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines a choice and a chance to do what they think they should do in order to succeed," said Cent Craver's Boeing expert.
They don't want us to decide what's gonna make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase side-by-side space, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a race for aircraft orders, valued at at at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio between American and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of seats is exactly what fuels competition between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one in their last two-engine long-distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seat series of 777X with the original 9-seat configuration of the 777 design series.
The unit cost gain is reduced by comparison with the 10-seat arrangement currently in use.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make his plane more competitive than our designs," said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus passenger comfort department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that parlours with a full 10-seat row for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating structure that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"The 18-inch seat would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is commercially driven by a threat from the 777th model," said the interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Flight dealers around the world even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
Commending the comforts, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight suite for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications to the salons by offering larger access points to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could divert attention from the sales wave of model 777X.
A new anti-nicotin vaccine can take away the process of smoking pleasure.
Scientists have developed an antinicotin vaccine that could deprive cigarette smoking of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from life-long nitric dependence.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Whale Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first results were encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nitric dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern methods," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down any molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotin blow.
Vaccinated mice, which were subsequently provided with nitrin, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that weren't given the vaccine were "relaxed," and that's a sign that didn't reach their brains," researchers say.
These experiments are described in Science Transnational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to the children before they had the desire to try a cigarette, preventing them from being subjected to nitric addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nitric vaccine, and that could help them get rid of the habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Olenikov: one third of the rural settlements of Pomoskovya, fully subsidized
The Vice-Governor of Pomoskovya Yuri Olenikov stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in Moscow province were fully subsidized
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants to the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent.
As part of the regional budget's budget, about 25 billion rubles are allocated," said Olenikov.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mochitish, Odtsevo and Pushkino - had a budget of more than 1 billion roubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is sorely lacking".
The cost of maintaining the local administration in 88 settlements in Pomoskovia is over 70 per cent, "with a decline in the quality of services", noted Olenikov.
Previously, he had instructed the heads of municipalities in Pomoskovia to think before the end of November about which settlements needed to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
The Governor of Moscow province had previously stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Pomoskovje, it was planned to reduce the number of rural grant settlements.
Also in Mojay, Kashir, Sunnynogor, Kolemen, Lubjertz and Kotelnik, there is a request for the consolidation of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
President Mobolduma Igor Brnzalov also stated that all in the coming Adm Reform are planning about 30 rural settlements in 12 sub-Moskovy regions.
This is due to the fact that of 178 rural settlements in Pomoskov, less than one third have a "acceptable" financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diana Arbenina doesn't hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina is now particularly time-consuming in her creative and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to work with Martha and Artem, not only to spend time teaching them, but also to entertain them as much as she can.
In the last week, Diana reported twice to her fans about her teaching talents.
First, she posted on Facebook a picture of her teaching her children to read.
And yesterday, she was pampering fans, showing me how Artham and Martha dressed for Halloween.
The broom races are ready! Our first Halloween" called Diana the photo of her children dressed in birthday suits.
Which is inadvisable, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, have something to do with this party because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce an "undefined sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate "undefined" instead of males or females when registering children born of hermaphrodites.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the sex on the birth certificate blank for the time being.
For "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents may write "X" (undefined) for the time being.
The purpose of this decision is not to force parents to rush into a "gender-specific" operation.
Statistics show that one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphroditis.
Tripody denies being influenced by Obaid
Joe Tripody, former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, will be part of an investigation into the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi contests changes in the lease of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned three properties on public land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease contracts at Serquilar Ki, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s clandestine participation in real estate after testimony given by Mr. Tripody Lynn Ashpoul, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease should be presented for public competition.
The renters were opposed to this, and they also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the business leases at Serkyular Kee, which brought the Obaid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who, as Mr. Tripody acknowledged, had urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
The telephone decrypting provided by ICAC included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripody and Steve Dunne, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obaid ' s leadership in the Fisheries Division.
"Has the issue discussed during these telephone conversations been the development of commercial rental policies?" Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheley, Mr. Tripody, asked.
"No," said Mr. Tripody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administrative official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked a target in the Syrian port town of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
On at least two occasions this year, Israel attacked aircraft carrying missiles inside Syria.
457 foreign visa workers can be tested for "authenticity"
A test of "authenticity" for foreign visa workers of class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457-grade visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The Government ' s discussion paper was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia ' s neighbours.
"The loud statements of "foreigners at the end of the line" and "Australian work first" represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market," she said to the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the corners of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper presented for discussion outlined 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria of "authenticity" are accepted, the applicant for a visa may be examined to determine whether "the candidate is genuine in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close friend of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise".
Enterprises may also be required to account for the number of sub-class 457 visa holders, since in the past, enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's nine-year-old son, who was killed in grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Semen Varlamova's friend stated that the hockey player suffered from alcoholism.
Semen Varlamov Eugenia Vavrinyuk's hockey friend stated that he suffered from alcoholism and was handed over by the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, inter alia, a woman.
It will be recalled that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating a Golkyper against Russia's team, Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair and beat her up - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach, and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself went to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on bail for $5,000.
The court did not restrict an athlete to travel across the country, but did not allow him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project will open a high-speed service with Scotland and Northern England, starting Phase I in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project "will unite Britain".
Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was "excited" to work on the plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase II is completed, the lines will be set up in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and shorter travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our target for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring Britain and its cities closer together."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But we are also talking about urban transport links with each other; throughout the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get a better message from HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with British ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Is Tory the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power costs without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and experts claim that its splintering does not leave waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures taken in the US to relax the regulations relating to these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remained in the Flight Mode.
Passengers may already do so during the main part of the flight, but it is annoying to many that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required United States airlines to do a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft", it stated.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and for passengers to comply with safety regulations as reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not opposed to the changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
"We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Aviation Safety Authority of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of client service now that it is on our planes," said the spokesperson.
Qantas stated that she would follow the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change them soon," she said.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the decision of the FAU and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference with mobile devices, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage standards and passenger instructions.
"After the airline has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude," FAA stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be located under the seats or in the upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head hears notes of extremism in the Kubani anthem
The football match between Angi and Kubanyu resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani anthem sounded different.
On Thursday, the head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov invited Republican parliamentarians to appear before the courts because the anthem of Krasnodar province allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, inter alia, calls for war against the "bazurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, which today was adopted in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here as the mother of your mother, the enemy, the bassurmanin, we go to the death battle," - for which the words are recorded in the anthem, to poison some believers against others," expressed solidarity with the Abdulatype President of the Hizri Shihsaid Parliament.
Putin secured impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from the ocean, namely Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has attacked Russian-made missiles that are reported to have been destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia, which allowed the US not to carry out a military operation to which they came close this summer.
More about weapons and what all this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us.
Washington stated that Assad's regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August of poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question isn't whether it's gonna happen, it's when it's gonna happen.
He's no longer a legit name and he has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success in diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has been impressed by a person ready to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, it is hardly easier for his mother to avoid being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's still hanging on.
And changing weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and CKH
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new Ministry responsible for construction and JKH and proposed to lead his ex-Governor, Mikhail Meni, of the Ivanov region, in a face-to-face meeting.
The President met Michael Men at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to lead the new agency.
Russian President Dmitri Peskov's spokesperson explained that all construction and LKH functions were being transferred to a new ministry from the Minre region.
Michael Mene is the son of a famous Orthodox priest, Protojereus Alexandra Mei, who graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry called Gobkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergijevo-Possad region, a deputy of the State Duma, the first Vice-Premier of the Moscow Region Government, and the Vice-Premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Men was governor of the province of Ivanov.
The pawn shop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a pawn shop at the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling puts in a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is in there," said Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she earns $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it makes its deal, became the third pawnshop on Singapore's stock exchange this week.
Jewellery loan is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The pawnshops in Singapore usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a subsidiary at the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit testing or proof of salary and can provide credit faster than banks.
Millions of people throughout the region therefore resorted to pawnshops, as families felt pressured by rising costs of living and rapidly increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans, fuelled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, identified the increase in the family's credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list from 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The truth is, with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income caps] will be looking for ways to supplement their incomes where they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people lay their personal belongings because they take advantage of the opportunity to earn money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70% of the stuff planted in 200 pawnshops in the city-state is gold.
People say, "Golden looks good, let's put the granny's gold chain on and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop is such that ValueMax, an operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others similar in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he owns four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S-66 million raised this week through the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors had given rise to criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the pawnshop not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
"Custodians lay down objects they already own and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And pawnshops are not only used by those categories of people who are in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices to plant gold bars or Rolex watches that can provide up to 60% of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," Ms. Yeah said.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number and status of existing health facilities that matters to the population, but the quality of health care provided.
The implementation of the programme "Modernizing Health Care in Tulsk Region 2011 - 2013" and the reorganization of the city's health-care facilities will make it possible to establish an optimal health-care structure for the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and mothers.
For example, after joining up with the hospital, it has become even more possible to bring in specialized specialists from the NSAS to consult pregnant women with various pathologies and to conduct additional tests at the hospital.
During the modernization programme, the material and technical base of the maternity home has been significantly improved and modern equipment in line with world standards has emerged.
During these years, approximately 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance of the premises and 112 items of equipment have been purchased at a cost of 42 million roubles.
The most up-to-date equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The O.R. uses the "Sell-Saver" machine to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return it to the woman in childbirth, avoiding the transmission of foreign blood.
The Clinical and Laboratory Diagnostics Unit has also been equipped with modern equipment.
The women ' s clinic has an electronic register, and there are plans to introduce electronic maps and patient history in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists.
The Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The citizens of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes at one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old male from Chechnya.
David Alabat, a champion of Bavaria, became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting on the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he outdone the representatives of winter sports, who have traditionally become the best in the country.
Marcel Hirscher took second place, and Gregor Schlernzauer took second place.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigeriaan origin helped his team win the Championship League, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov.
Andrei Arshavin Julia Baranovsky, the former civil wife of Peter's "Zenit" footballer, spends his vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy with actress Anastasia Zarogova, her fiancé Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos of couples walking together have been published in Instagram Anastasia of the Road.
This isn't the first picture of Andrei and Julia together.
On 5 October, the Roadway published a photo of a couple standing on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Hawbek "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted to living separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovsky and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, having three children.
Recently, it was reported that Arshavin was dating Alice Kazmina's ex-model.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Saved package of $325 million for Tasmania health care
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the weakened Tasmania health system will be supplemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.
The decision on funding for four years was taken after consultations between the Government and the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the planned operations blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for unrecorded clinics in Hobart and Lonston to improve the quality of after-patient care, train health professionals, mental health services and introduce personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will be based on ideas put forward by leading doctors on how best to help Tasmania's health care system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmania Government would work under strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything, "if they were not followed by genuine reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis".
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing the state's health system out of critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures largely compensate for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition representative for health, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is "a solution similar to that of a white-collar.
"The reason we're here is because the state Labour government threw up $430 million from the health care system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government pulls out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Pliberseck to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Guillaume Nicklu of Danny Didro's novel may boast of exceptional performances and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, launched in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by his family.
When she starts to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist superintendent and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to vileness or sensation, and that's the problem.
Because of its solemnity, the story risks being a test of a moose and an audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing equipment, says the observation team.
Syria destroyed the basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, and the international monitoring group announced on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the outbreak of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The chemical weapons ban declaration was issued one day before
The deadline of 1 November established by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "impair" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the production of toxic gas and to fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in the town of Safira, where experts believe a chemical weapons production facility, as well as a storage site, is reported by the British-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government ' s side, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among those killed, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN July 25 estimate, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad ' s troops fought the rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there had been casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fights highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are fuelled by the short time frame of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team "is now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all critical Syrian items of production and mixing/fueling equipment".
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were, according to Syria, "deposited and ... chemical weapons programme items in them were moved to other declared sites that were verified".
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safira was one of the two locations that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Üzümcü, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year now, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are made up of members of its Alavite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a major explosion on the environment at an air defence site in the coastal province of Syria of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger due to the conviction of the organizers of the Bali terrorist attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 victims of the bomb attack in Bali in 2002 reacted angryly to the sentence of the last conspirator who was brought to trial and stated that Umar Patek must be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in creating the explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he is granted parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kut, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a "explosive" for his reputation as a bomb master should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth's mother, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack committed by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
As soon as she stopped crying, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He has to appear before the firing squad, " said Ms. Cortin AAP.
"I have to live every day knowing I won't have any more grandchildren and I won't see my daughters."
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device placed in an outside van was detonated immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma and "dead" three times for a month, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the plight of the other three members of the Jemaa Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imam Samudra — who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds, that's not much.
Patek is the last person to take part in the Bali attack to stand trial.
He had been in hiding for almost a decade, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where United States forces killed former Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence had testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He has not given up," Ms. Cortin said.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict is on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the attack, which will take place later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Cortin said.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use jet gadgets (but not call from a mobile phone)"
Airpassers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Office on Thursday.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wart at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," FAU stated.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They shouldn't restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives them "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, FAA stated.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, President of the Association of Professional Cruisers, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling "school duty" when it comes to this issue.
But the Internet connection for surfing, e-mails, text messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft.
So there's still no Words with Friends, the smart online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident occurred: the actor was taken off American Airlines for refusing to turn the device off while the plane was on its way to landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the baggage compartment, because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU, has regulatory authority over telephone calls.
FAU may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national transport safety expert CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"The cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCS, that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air," Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee set up by FAU to look into this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been an increase in pressure on FAA to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as the state senator Claire McCaskill, claim that there are no compelling security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to limit passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAU as electronically resistant.
The airlines have been offering the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to increase the use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Wert.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than the previous generations of devices.
Electronic book reading devices, for example, emit only minimal signals when the pages are turned.
But the signals get stronger when the devices load or send the data.
The company Amazon.com was among those who sought to ease restrictions on passengers using electronic devices.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the entire airliner with their devices to read Kindle's electronic books and flew them to check for problems, but never found them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only individual reports from pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
The committee recommended, however, that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during landings in reduced visibility conditions.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step towards passengers who now use many technology devices.
"We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Doe, Director General of the United States Tourism Association.
Motor schools will be able to sit driving examination
The driving licence examination will be open to private companies with their own computerized driveway.
This is written by Commersant with reference to the Government's draft Regulation "On admission to driving".
According to the newspaper, at present there are only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
The students of such "privileged" driving schools are expected to read the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Motor Inspectorate will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the site do not pass the first time, such a school will be denied six months' privileges.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government Regulation will come into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for driving two-wheelers.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an examination in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the examination.
A bird that was airlifted to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
The bird, which was transported by air to the shore after being found exhausted at an oil tower in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month, and was then taken out by the Scottish Unit of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
The manager of the centre, Colin Ceddon, said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who entered a zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
Looks like the bird's exhausted and managed to find shelter on the oil tower.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so we were approached for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives to determine what changes Britain's wealth and job makers want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the complicated institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the European trade zone — even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most developed in Europe.
Last and foremost, our survey of business executives revealed that a clear majority wants Britain to pursue a policy of contract change and a trade-based relationship with the EU, rather than a policy-based one.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will restore power back to Britain.
The stakes are high — achieving changes in the treaty and more favourable terms for Britain will result in a 16 per cent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the review will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and financial integration.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and our survey shows that for business this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
The U.S. intelligence services are listening to the Pope's personal phone.
The Vatican's activities are under the surveillance of American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection indicate that US intelligence was auditioning for all of the previous Pope Benedict's negotiations, and now has strong custody of Pope Francis.
His phone started bugging even before he became head of the Vatican.
The election process for the new Pope was also monitored.
Of particular importance in the US.
The intelligence service has connected to the cell phones of the Cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the Conclave members lived were also bugged.
American spies auditioned all the main contestants for the Papal throne to prevent Washington's undesired figure from appearing on it.
"Panorama" magazine reports that "a big U.S. ear" continued to intercept conversations of prelates until the end of the conclave on March 12.
In the United States, it is alleged that, since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been designated as the Pope's future.
American intelligence also monitored negotiations related to the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work at the Roman Embassy of the United States to extract information on politics and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican reconciled that he didn't care about the American "slut," even if it happened.
There are no secrets from the U.S. leadership to the Holy Fathers.
Snowboardist for the Olympic Bill was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
Nominal bill - 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorial note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Bill on 30 October, they noted that a picture of a snowboardist from a banknote could be found in photo banks.
In particular, a free-of-charge photo of StockExchange, where the photograph is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop class published on the Russian website Mega-Observation on January 18, 2011.
It was also used in the RugGear smartphone commercial.
The Olympic banknote is blue and blue.
On the one hand, there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, and on the other, a view of the Olympic stadium and the Jarbird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushouev, who won a contest among students of the St. Petersburg Repin Academy of Arts.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered, such as skiing, freestyle and skiing, but that they eventually chose a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source Izves, close to the C.E.C., the regulator does not care about the public opinion about the wide distribution of the image of the snowboardist from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But Goznak isn't too worried about the noise around the Olympic bill.
The head of the press service of the State Celebrity, Natalia Nikiforova, said "Izves", that all the reasoning about plagiarism is ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the note will turn to the right, the photo on the web to the left, and Nikiforov has specified.
The person at the photo shoot to create the bill was taken from different points, then the final image was selected, and on it it was a typical snowboardist position.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic bill, as the artist had been paid for his work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion - is considered by Alexey Popovichev, the CEO of the PN, "Rus Brand".
It is difficult to prove a hundred per cent similarity between the images on the bills and in the photo banks, so it is unlikely that there will be any intellectual property claims against the image.
The Olympic banknote was first released in China for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, and a 10 Yuan banknote was released.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer.
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
By their way of thinking, the country's beer consumption will remain stable next year, at best.
Although the businessmen were originally expecting growth.
This is a bad year for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, Isaac Sheppes, President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beerbirds, reported all of this at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, "Tovars of Daily Demand in Russia", which just concluded in Moscow.
It discussed public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery industry with respect to the production and trafficking of beer - a small drink - reported to the students of Sheps.
In no country in the world is there such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and irrational prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many of the legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse had little effect, yet new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The most painful beer producers have been the ban on selling liquor in kiosks since this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Shapes.
Next year, the brewers have two projections.
Optimistic is the one Sheppes was talking about: sales of foam beverage will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic-- another 2% to 3% drop.
In order to save their profits, businessmen have to move from mass consumer varieties to the "premium" class: the beer will become smaller, but it will cost more.
However, the radical consequences of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are yet to be seen.
"My observations indicate that the level of alcohol abuse remains at about the same level," the drug doctor Alexey Sotnikov reported.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use hard-drink surrogates, as well as those who are "adhesive" on alcohol-containing tonics such as Jaguar, whereas ten years ago it was "drink" alcohol that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were laid off from the Ford road factory in Allwoljsk.
As the unions say, all those who were dismissed received compensation.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is much more acute than the problems of workers.
A member of the regional Zacksa Alexei Etmanov said at the meeting that the Ford factory in Vocvolozsk had reduced some 600 people.
According to him, this had taken place in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the plant under the voluntary termination programme, which had been developed with the organization ' s trade union.
"Golden parachutes" of several salaries were offered to workers who chose to resign of their own free will.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think it's gonna stop there.
However, the authorities are not planning to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support the difficult regional enterprises," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large job losses when adopting the budget.
In Ford, this information is neither denied nor confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're gonna publish him.
We've been talking about cutting down workers at Ford's factory in Allwolzsk for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people became known as early as September.
The plant had previously declared the production of cars suspended.
The decline in the demand for Ford cars in Russia was cited as a reason at the factory.
According to Petrostata, there was a 5.4 per cent decline in industrial production in Lenoblati during the nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobiles will be available during take-off and landing.
New regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States and are being announced by BBC.
It is expected that United States airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the voyage, and the new regulations will be in place by the end of 2013.
However, communications with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Because of the risk of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be prohibited.
The passengers of the flights will thus be allowed to read electronic books, play tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, like the United States of America, existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flight could also be reviewed in Britain.
A new name, the Brad Circle, was finally established for the Russian mob in the United States.
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian mob" in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has introduced three Russian representatives, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli into the "Brat Circle".
One of the Russians was a famous singer, Grigory Leps, whom the United States is suspected of transporting money for members of the band.
There are 22 individuals on the U.S. blacklist involved in the Brad Circle and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts had doubts about the existence of such an organization.
"The claim of the Brad Circle is more like an attempt to unite fragmented criminal groups," said an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York, Mark Galeotti.
In his view, the "Brat Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian Mafia".
"I haven't met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quoted Mr. Galeotti as the United States Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti also agrees with George Mason University Professor Liz Shelley.
"If they're working together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she says, the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brat Circle" brought together more close Russian thieves in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shuchanashvili and Zakaria Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandpa Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Grandpa Hassan.
He noted, however, that some individuals had nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his view, they were all rather united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, in the Brad Circle, attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which led to such a decision as to why he was placed on such lists, said the spokesperson for Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any event, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of the construction of the Southern Flow pipeline in Bulgaria marked the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
"There has been a landmark event today: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said Chairman Gazprom Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The Southern Flow is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia's European gas is located, increases the risk level for normal routes, says officials.
Miller stated that the direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual pipeline design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in the Sarat district, a Peugeot car driver took off on the 115 km of the Odessa Renee road and ran into a bus carrying six people.
This is reported by the press service of the Office of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Odessa province.
A 31-year-old Peugeot driver died in the accident.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were hit by a stabbing leg.
Medical doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, and she refused to be hospitalized.
Ambulances also examined all other passengers.
Squads picked up the bus with a crane and released the bus driver, whose leg was trapped in the bus door.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has learned.
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children prior to bringing charges against a child care worker in Caringbach, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But the commission's opening statement stated that it had "never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization".
Philip Hare, Chief Executive Officer, was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences and another in which an instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Fernes, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA had also been inaccurate in her opening speech to the commission, arguing that "there were external reviews by YMCA that admitted that YMCA was at the forefront of children's safety".
The evidence submitted to the Commission indicates that YMCA was informed that it received the second of the four possible quality audits carried out by the Department of Education and Communities last August.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and the lower management had failed by hiring the Lord, and had failed to ensure that staff understood their obligations to report violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the assumption that YMCA corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting violations of the Lord's child safety.
The staff members testified that they had observed violations, including the Lord being alone with the children, taking care of them personally, placing them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was led by the Lord and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, a child care manager at the YMCA branch in Karingbach, who was Lord's head "very scary and often difficult to access".
The Executive Director said that he did not accept staff members ' explanations that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord had led them away from the need to report him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented his opinion to the YMCA board of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from the "accident with Jonathan Lord" did not "relate to the provision of information" by the staff, and the board agreed with it.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations had been made by the YMCA Director General of Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the destruction of evidence, but that it was "overzealous" and that the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during Jonathan Lord ' s work in New South Wales between 2009 and 2011, reported to the commission by an expert on child molestation, Professor Stephen Smolbone of Griffith University.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, selection, mentoring, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing is postponed until December 20th.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She's not just a model in her home country, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Buendschen left her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, she came here on purpose these days and this week of hyphels.
A month's absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she was in the Rings.
Fashion Week Finals are usually the most interesting shows.
It's like a Lino Villaventura stylist.
Marke is over 30 years old, in parallel with the production of a luxury-class pret-a-porta, and the designer is active in theatre and cinema, producing performances and costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and fashion world participated in the final week of fashion in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamic areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and has an annual turnover of up to $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he'd take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided British policy debates, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
When asked if he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, according to London's Evening Standard, he said, "Yes, of course, but I don't think that's gonna happen, so..."
Milana's chief coach, Massimiliano Allegre, expressed regret for the result of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure in the start-up was due to a series of injuries sustained by leading players.
I'm sorry we couldn't win," he says, "Tmw the words of Allegory."
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let anything happen to Lazio.
The second Romans added up, but in general, I can't say we've lost concentration.
I had to win.
Last season, we did the task of getting into the Champion League.
We're behind schedule now, but it's due to a series of injuries to key football players.

Look at Kaca, who held a high-level meeting.
Experts from competitive events moving to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months earlier, who took his first steps, this kid and his pet, the Shetland pond of Toffy, raced three tours to easily take the prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This indistinguishable couple — the same height — received high marks for their appearance, behaviour, and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnibenk Mount Sports Center in Radri, near Cardiff.
As he walked out to the public with men and women wearing graceful hats, he moved his hat and proudly spent his two-year-old Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for his long-standing innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy got the highest grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given a gift to Toffy for his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make up a beautiful duet."
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
A total stranger in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Weil in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of her Aunt Sharon Howels, who has been posting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howels said, "All the public was stunned, and everyone was screaming and clapping."
He ran through the sand the whole length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did a fine job.
Fenton's crazy about animals -- he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be taking part in "The Horse of the Year", and I'm sure he'll do well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "The Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves at the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the pony and the manufacturer's performances — Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the call "to be reorganized"
The Chinese newspaper, which had published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the slander of a reporter, must be reorganized, reporting to the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yungzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with State ownership.
Now the New Express must go through a "full error correction process," as the regulator reports.
The order for "correction" came from the Guangdong Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express editorial manual has been misdirected," says the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yungzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter's licence".
He also "directed Youngcheng Evening News Group to make a full correction of the New Express errors and recommended that it investigate the situation-related newspaper's officials and immediately amend the New Express's leadership".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust," he said to the public broadcasting company CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page stating that the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
The experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to self-incriminating.
A U.S. tunnel — Mexico for drug trafficking — equipped with its own railroad — has been discovered.
Found one of the most complex drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as one of the most difficult secret moves ever discovered by them, four by three feet wide.
This tunnel, which has a length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with undetectable warehouses, which makes it easier to load drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, as the authorities claimed.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the cannabis harvest in October, which posed a challenge for drug cartels to deliver their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage length of approximately 700 yards, equipped with rail routes, which ranged from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November of this year, and BELTA has been informed by the General Pension Administration of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
From 1 November this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic, which was applied to the previous calculation of pensions, will be adjusted with an increase of 5.4 per cent, and a corresponding recalculation of the labour pension will be made in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recalculation from November, it is estimated that retirement pensions will increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month as of November this year.
At the same time as the calculation of employment pensions, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pension supplements will be recosted in November of this year due to the increase in the subsistence budget per capita on average.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government at the level of Br1 million, 570 million, an increase of 2.1 per cent over the amount of 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent as of 1 November.

British police give Assanju a notice of extradition
The British police today gave notice of extradition to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian "official demand to surrender" requesting him to report to the police station, adding that if he failed to do so, he would be further arrested.
Assanju faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "gived a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which requires him to come to the police station on the day and time of our choice", as reported by the spokesperson.
He continues to violate the terms of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic ops on the WikiLeaks website, which opposes secrecy.
Driver driving 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The car was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between its legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howie from Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz at A120 in Braintre on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a beverage between his legs.
In the Court of Justice, Colchester Howie found that he had been accused of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also required to pay £90 and an extra charge of £100 to assist victims of crime.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst
Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, introduced a state duty rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own houses in partnership rather than as individuals.
So far, the government has been providing housing in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: "After the increase in government spending on expensive houses and the introduction of related anti-aversion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of high-value real estate is understated, regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move may lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate, the top 5-10 percent of the housing market at a price, rose by 11.8 percent over the past year in the rich southwest belt of London, from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savilles, prices in central London continued to show a steady increase of 5.6 per cent in annual terms, but they were eclipsed by a strong domestic market with a surge in prices in the south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog's tail moves are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs hang their tail on the right side (from the dog's point of view), while troubled dogs wave their tail mostly on the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can see and respond to these subtle differences in tail swinging.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that people's left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in creating incentives that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it from other species.
He added that just like a human, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to a variety of tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals while watching movies about other dogs.
They measured the rate of heartbeat of animals and analysed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs a video of dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When animals saw that otherwise the non-expressing dog moved its tail to the right (in terms of a waving dog's tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning to the left (newly in terms of a waving dog's tail), their heartbeat was increasing and they seemed anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs had deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried about or not.
He observes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and their tail is often in one direction associated with more friendly behaviour and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with a better understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert in dog behavior, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at Bristol University Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads left when they look at an aggressive dog and right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific paper by Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when her tail was swerving to the left than to the right instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite behavior towards Italian research."
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Where there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, perhaps soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Artic Monkeys are putting off a gig in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's illness.
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was supposed to be performing at Hydro's town concert set on Friday.
However, the vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to reschedule the show.
The band's statement was made after it was forced to postpone the LG Arena concert at Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Artic Monkeys reported: "After deciding to move the show to Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show on the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November".
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is not able to perform."
The LG Arena show in Birmingham is now on November 20, and the Glasgow show on the Hydro site is on November 21.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.
We want to apologize to all ticket owners for any inconvenience they may have suffered.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will set up new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually be involved in the selection of his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal can no longer take part in the Papal election, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 "Cardinal electors".
In announcing this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Consistorium, would be held before the ceremony.
"Papa Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistorium in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from around the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to drop.
He said that Dad usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The consistorium will be important next year because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
So far, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if the new Pope would appoint Cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
They will also be the first to be chosen cardinals since the formation of the French Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that "it is possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before — this is the first time we've had this.
Valero said that the popes used to appoint a cardinal bishop from the major parishes, but Francis "is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's going to call."
GM withdraws a number of new pickup trucks in the United States to improve seat backs
General Motors Co. withdraws almost 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address problems with manual seat back adjustment, following a Friday notification from U.S. vehicle safety regulators.
For some of the pick-up trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the back angle mechanism.
As a result, the seat back does not meet federal vehicle head restraints safety standards.
"The head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury when striking the rear of the vehicle" is stated in the notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The withdrawn models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important production of the car for the leading American car manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported a defect to truck owners in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider the notice to owners due to the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, grew by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup trucks and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The Cry of Obama's Desperate Voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama allowed Republican obstructionism to undermine commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama ' s reformed health system website, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in times of depression in the second year of medical school and restore me to a sense of hope.
It's called "Witness for Victory," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight and going to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people, and the performances may have taken a breath.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot paper, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of a law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the rule of "Don't ask, don't tell", the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of the Guantánamo base, among others.
But after countless times, when I stood on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of my colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations I could give.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to wire foreign leaders or to hit innocent children in other countries with drones.
He could not explain the collection of data on American privacy by the National Security Agency or the persecution of disclosures of government misconduct.
He cannot explain the killing of the American citizen Anwar Al-Awlaqi without trial or the failure to respect the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusion that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
More recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Accessible Health Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have realized at the age of 18 that the leadership could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that holding an elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our social dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by random events such as the beating in New Town.
Nevertheless, it is clear from all the examples I have listed above that they were, to a large extent, their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was very excited about him.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and he seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 percent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
It makes me miss the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that described how Clinton had inflicted a deafening defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary election.
At a meeting to analyse the reasons for his failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to return our appeal," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, made this statement at a time when he was trying to avoid questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be decisive in deciding on the removal of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political action.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters were pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether they would get leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner of the Sanshain-Kost seat of the Fairfax constituency, with 53 votes cast after the vote was re-voting.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting process in order to expedite the process.
Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget's daughters.
Should a decision be taken on these elections two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system to come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission was exploring possibilities for electronic voting and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and would take his new job "very seriously".
Public office involves the service of society.
"We do not seek any reward other than the thanks of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders from its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an ongoing investigation that coincides with the LIBOR interbank manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation of this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, well-informed people said that RBS handed over e-mail and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the British regulatory authority, the Financial Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave to his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot bidding at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any offence.
Mr. Asher ' s contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable people.
UBS reported this week that it took action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency-market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators worldwide — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, who were familiar with the situation.
Banks have been looking at instant messages and e-mails over the years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
The audit news has fuelled traders in the area of activities that have been one of the largest sources of income in recent years for trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has encountered difficulties because low currency volatility has reduced opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that a vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their internal platforms means that "you can start to influence the market at a very low price".
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its stock-tenders at the London Exchange this week, after it had caused losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue has been localized," Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today has ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Act requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The Chief Justice, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page Act and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that states increase compliance with Medicaid, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for Medicaid, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of discord?
In the State Duma, in the framework of the "open rostrum", politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the suggestions made was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it was a game of scandal and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "level of tension in society", politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers referred to measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to discussion with confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Biryulev were "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "there are too many people and entities to answer for these questions" and seven babysitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe had long practised against migrants had failed, according to the socialist, and it was necessary to find a way.
The historian Yuri Petrov had great hopes for a new, unified history book.
"It is still necessary to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that school children in Tartarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Züganov proposed criminalizing "calls to dismember Russia": "If the United States says on radio that Alaska should hand over Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovsky tried very hard not to inflate.
As usual, he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public debate: "In the midst of controversy, there is little to say!"
Vladimir Vasiliev, leader of the Uniting Russia faction, immediately advised journalists to conclude a charter and agree to talk carefully on the subject, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the whole order is in place, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-national peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andricchenko did not share her admiration for the law: it does not "clearly understand what the adaptation of migrants is, its mechanisms and its limits.
The actors will then treat the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the human resources necessary to deal with such complex issues, do not have the means and do not have the guidance they can use, the centre provides them with ...
The head of the Dominan Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the threatening name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s, which was subsequently abolished, opposed.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, "Minister without portfolio", to whom you can turn if you need anything.
"We walk on the edge, the shells break apart, it's very important that people of different ethnicities and religions work together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," said the representative of the RPC on relations with the Society of Allvolod Chaplin.
In his view, there should be no neutrality on the part of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ideologies.
Here, Oleg Nealov led the discussion into an unexpected direction: "A lot more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be looked for, but they are pushed into the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be equals in the world in this sport!" said the right-wing word.
No one will play in the rugby in the Caucasus! Mr. Girinovsky immediately intervened.
You're gonna offer them a kerling!
You need to know the country's specifics, it's like a Georgian of the "Shooter" to offer."
In Jaroslavla, the representatives of the Moscow Club, while playing with the local club, distinguished themselves with wild behavior at the rostrum.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation's supervisory and disciplinary committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuban had been fined 500,000 roubles and that SE's correspondent Philippe PAPENKOV had been transferred from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Reddar Club were imposed for burning the flag of Dugestan by fans on the rostrum during the 14th round of home games against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the FEPL.
We've been researching all the available materials.
For the improper behaviour of the viewers of Cuban, a fine of 500,000 rubles has been imposed.
Google, Samsung, Huavei patent suits have been filed against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent suits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it interrupted at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement claim with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corp, Huavei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key words of Internet search with their corresponding advertising, the claim states, which is the foundation of Google's search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that operate on the Android operating system of Google, which competes fiercely with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered the original $900 million price for Nortel patents.
Google increased the price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
After losing the Northel patent case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this deal the determining factor was in part the Motorola patent library.
"Despite the unsuccessful attempt to purchase at auction the patents that are the subject of the suit, Google has violated and continues to violate them," the lawsuit states.
Rockstar claims increased damages from Google because he claims that the violation of his patent rights by Google is intentional under the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president takes the oath
Muhammad Mursi takes the oath, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised "a new Egypt" when he took the oath, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes at the courthouse on the bank of Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We want a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi during a ceremony broadcast live on State television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American entity from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that for the most part of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization that targeted the brutal actions of successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Presidential post of Mubarak, the movement was stopped for only a short time to allow his convoy to pass on a normally busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was mocked as a non-charismatic "back wheel" by the Brothers, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and his Friday performance, in which he tried to represent himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in a wooden chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that fulfilled the national anthem, during which he stood at the "Serene" counter.
A military officer, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His visit was met with the slogan "Armenia and the People — One Hand", which chanted hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bulwark of secular education, Cairo University became a bulwark of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where an uprising broke out that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to restore the presidency, which had been disenfranchised by the military council that had taken over the affairs of the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the courts, rather than before Parliament as usual, he is doing the will of the military, which is a sign that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theater gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Manufacturers of the Tumen Region was held at the Jalutorov Motor Plant.
The event included the launch of a new line for the manufacture of electrical welding pipes from steel.
According to Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was conducted in 2011 with the arrival of the new owner.
It turns out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrical welding pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the plant ' s profile and install equipment for its production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of production have been shipped.
More than 120 million rubles were invested in the plant, says Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new station was launched, allowing for an expansion of the range.
The plant produces both a small section of the pipe, which is used for greenhouses, small construction and furniture industries, and a large one for the construction industry.
Plans to reach the level of 50,000 tons of production per year, which would account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the shift to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157, and in the plan for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is re-trained and the necessary specialists are drawn from existing ones.
It is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutter in the coming year, with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another, at a rate of 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is about to develop pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The company ' s management aims to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumen region ' s demand for these products.
Leonid Ostromov, Deputy Director of Investment Policy, advised that more attention should be paid to the modernization of the engineering industry when addressing managers.
This is also the case in the form of government support for industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and its leasing costs.
This year, 150 million roubles have been allocated for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will review the grant contracts, accepts the documents from the enterprises by 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the coming year, the budget provided for 150 million roubles, which could be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
The amount is reduced to 72 million roubles for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment produced in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostromov, this form of support will eventually cease because the reason for its introduction was compensation for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so, and subsidies are becoming direct spending obligations of the region.
Therefore, the Government has given priority to direct support to industrial enterprises rather than to the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will relate to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders have expressed concern about the evolving situation with the oil industry.
The grant for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the southern Tumen region, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the medium band in Russia, where the cheaper labour force is.
In addition, the continuity of the new owner of the VC TNCs, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen enterprises, is not clear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvata project expires in 2013 and no extension has been requested.
Currently, southern industries that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes from oil produced in the Uvat region will be paid to the region ' s budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist social media ad.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours ' mandatory work, who posted a video on the social network with an extremist orientation, informed RIA Novosti on Friday of the representative of the Regional Court ' s press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted on his popular social media page a video entry on the federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation entitled "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of human dignity, committed in public".
"The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence, sentencing him to 240 hours of compulsory work," said the agency's interviewer.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised the Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall considerably after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He said that in his conversation with readers of his Facebook page.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, with the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would also have to fall.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," wrote Azarov.
In the case of other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be that direct; it will be indirect.
But there shouldn't be any price increases either.
So reports on billboards that have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, that association with the EU is a price increase, that's not quite the case, or to put it that way," Summarized Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bijsk
On 29 October, the media reported that a kindergarten teacher in Bijska had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently looking into all the circumstances and are also providing a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the charge of bad taste, Eugenia Vasiliev spoke.
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous press publications, both about thefts in the Ministry of Defence and about her personal relationship with the former Minister of Defence, Anatoly Heartykov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, a figure in the Oboronservice case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, Vasiliev stated, "The original task was of course exactly the same: to extract from me any negative information about the former Secretary of Defense."
There was blackmail to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of winning.
It can be concluded from the interview that perhaps Vasilyev was most affected by the words that she did not have good taste.
Probably referring to the statement by the official representative of the UK of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that counterfeits had been found in the collection of paintings collected by a figure in the Oboronservice case.
Among the property seized, there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, an art expert appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap forgerys," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from DOD, and they said I didn't taste good.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal issues?
I think it's just a mess," Vasilyeva says.
On the other hand, when asked if she admitted her guilt in any of the 12 criminal incidents she was charged with, Vasilyeva stated: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in question.
Just misleading people, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to today's statement by the UK of the Russian Federation that Vasiliev was avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, the lawyer of the figuretian woman stated that he and his client were "not allowed by the investigator to familiarize himself with the case file".
What led to the revelations of Vasileva, who had not yet spoken to the press, who was under house arrest?
Perhaps as a woman, she couldn't not answer the bad taste charge?
Or are the journalists Komsomolka who claimed a few days ago that she was "into an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatolia Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
Viktor Baranets, a well-known military columnist of the KP, wrote in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?": "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogation."
Previously, Vasiliev had taken on some charges of illegal sale of DOD real estate.
Premonition of trouble.

Do you think the travel agents went back in time because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record profits from recreational activities in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourism firm now expects its main annual gross revenue before taxation to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to the previous projection of $305 million to $315 million.
If current targets are achieved, this would represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Executive Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre received 8 per cent of its profits in the first half of the year and began the second half with good performance, especially on a week-long trip to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"From the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record high return for a full year before interest and tax deductions," he said.
"This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the biggest profits."
In Australia, the recreational business recovered in the second half of the year, making up for a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre business performed well in leisure, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and profits are expected for the third full year in a row.
Last night, the Flight Centre stock increased by three cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, Barnaul police discovered two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on the Street of Flynn.
At the time of the check, there was a game going on in the establishment.
The club counted 24 machine guns.
Another play club was found in the Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 arcade machines used here.
Russia's UMAD on Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been prepared under the article "Illicit organization and conduct of gambling".
The tech's been removed.
In the near future, material on these facts will be sent to the industrial and Lenin courts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the New Region in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlov province, two women with signs of violent death were found dead the previous day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, following a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on the street of Uralsk.
The victims were soon identified.
They were found to be sisters, one of whom was a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years old and the other a 33-year-old resident of Orenburg province.
They rented an apartment that burned down a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the chief police officer in Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs agencies were working on various versions of the murder and were checking the alibi of previously tried citizens and those who were prone to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for which women rented an apartment and where they lived before, what they were doing, who they were in a relationship with.
Schools called for greater attention to mathematics, orthography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature from 1914 onwards.
The examination will also include "out-of-programme texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a separate final language examination, with strong recommendations for selecting English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to issue new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other major subjects next year.
The separate regulatory body for the OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure for the secondary school graduation examinations, with a new system of ratings and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence", insisting that the school finals would be "more complex, more ambitious and more stringent".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of schooling.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics in the calendar, coalition sources have said that the large-scale school math finals, combined with the higher ratio in the rating table, are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional education in this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life goals", including financial mathematics.
Hahe tickets will cost 2,200 rubles to tourists
Starting tomorrow, tourists will start taking ships to the air pillow from the Bohemian in Hayhe.
For those who want to go to China, it means extra expenses.
The puma ticket has traditionally been much more expensive than the boat.
According to AmourASSO's reference service, the normal ticket would cost 2,200 roubles.
Travel through the comfort hall will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, tickets didn't come up this season: the same price was paid by tourists and last spring, and a year ago in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth of the Russian Federation is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers the Russian Federation's GDP growth rate to be insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of credit for business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, oriented towards innovation, informs Reuters.
We planned GDP growth this year around 3%, maybe just a little bit more.
It's going to be a little less than 2% real.
Against a background of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not very bad, but it is not bad for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries and, in general, has to be faster in order to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, the Russian business, receive normal loans at a normal price - the first thing to do," the head of government stressed.

Filth, river and jungle visit to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwellet and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
There aren't many doctors in this West African country, just one in 5,000.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become CNN's Hero of the Year.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and return to unconscious state, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
At first, his arm was broken, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of itself for the rest of her life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they might have received.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwellet died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them could not afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem is poverty," Bwelle said.
"And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives."
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwellé was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwellet and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It has also established a non-profit organization, ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are packed in vans, tied to roofs with medical supplies, and travelling across the border to visit villages in need.
They're not always lucky.
Several times they had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are met as true heroes — a feast with songs and dances and the best places locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for celebration, and Bwelle, with his wide smile and infinite energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people on each trip," said Bwelle.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-end clinics provides a variety of health services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can obtain crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for a school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations usually take place in a school building, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitary treatment of the equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's too fast, but the team's commitment usually helps to support village musicians.
"They beat drums all night to keep us awake and keep working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Surgeon Bwelle also works nights at private health clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, which provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwelle group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwellet," said O'Malley.
As a sophomore student, you would never have had that opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bvelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live happy lives, fulfilling their father's promise is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this job," Bwelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretap.
A member of the Bundestag, Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Germany in the case concerning a possible wire-tapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the United States Special Security Forces.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear," said Hans-Cristian Schtrebele, "that he knows a lot.
Even though the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, the conditions for his arrival must first be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to respond to the scandal surrounding US spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the United States Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Maquis, reported this to journalists at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, and a reporter from BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkeyn relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two countries' public administrations will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves," said Vladimir Makay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would provide all necessary facilities and maximum cooperation.
The Minister also reported that the eighth regular meeting of the Belarus-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, following which a protocol had been signed.
The parties have drawn up a road map for Belarusian-Turkeyn cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy office, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as at finding new forms and avenues of cooperation.
"The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey see each other as reliable partners", he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, reported that at the talks the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
In the Minister's view, trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, since there was an unused potential in that area, he believed.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
It will also create all the necessary conditions for trade and economic ties and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey", Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care.
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama turned a blind eye yesterday to his often repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified to stop service from their service providers, Republicans have in recent days criticized the president for misleading American society.
Last night, Obama made some adjustments to his original public promise.
"The majority of people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in his speech in Boston.
Regarding what he called a "resurvive on the news" to stop services, Obama called on the notified Americans to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance schemes at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance themselves may have to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required under the Accessible Health Care Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sibelius in a speech before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on accessible health care, said that the Internet sale site had been "worryly bad" since October.
"I'm just as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
"I really want your trust back."
Annoying Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was captured by an on-line microphone sitting behind her to an assistant at yesterday's hearing in the chamber after a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the "architect" of the Affordable Health Care Act had not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposed on millions of Americans.
Rosballt denied media status for uncensored fighting.
On 31 October, Mosgaursud declared the registration license of Rosbalt null and void, writing "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted that the agency should be removed from media status for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
The trial set an unpleasant precedent: the court considered it possible to close down the media by effectively denying the publication the right to put forward counterarguments.
What's "Rosball"?
The "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the years that followed, the agency opened a second headquarters office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosballt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was one of the most recognized private media outlets in Russia.
However, Rosballt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications has been (and so far) written with references to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions about the proximity of the publication to the security forces continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosballt had an extensive source base in various agencies, the project was led by Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov.
However, the role of Chaplin in Rosballom's leadership is not clear: it is often referred to as "the project manager".
The director-general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosballt has not been on federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the "LiveInternet" rating of visits to Russian media sites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of Rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 viewers), and the monthly average is about 3 million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin's powerlessness in its relations with Ukraine, the death of a soloist of the "King and Joke" group, and the pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
The Rossballa conflict with Roscomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, prohibiting non-censorious violence against journalists.
The agency discovered a prohibited language in two videos published on the agency's website ("Gigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled oil towers").
The other sides are described in different ways.
Roscomnadzor, on the basis of the video found, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to withdraw the licence from the agency.
In Rosballte, the agency's claims were said to be wrong: first, the commercials were not editorials; secondly, the mother's words were disguised in them; and thirdly, immediately after warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The Agency ' s representatives appealed against Roscomnadzor ' s claims to the Magistrate ' s Court, and when Mosgaardud accepted the Roskomnadzor claim on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, the 25th Justice of the Peace had already ruled against Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov, had been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles, 10,000 for each commercial.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the Mosgaardsud hearing, given the idea that the outcome might have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate Rosballa's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It cannot be said that Rosballt was left alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (the declaration to the head of Roscomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, on 10 October, was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CDF).
The Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Allvolod Bogdanov, the Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Goosev, and the President of the Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov, have claimed that the closure of the publication was inappropriate.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roscomnadzor even gave him some assurance that the licence would not be revoked.
The Rosbalt trial has shown that under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media to be in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament in Damascus was completed one day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use and was to transfer them to the BBC.
Destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, toxic substances were currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The primary objective of the inspectors was to spare no time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, OPCW and Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly verified by the Western Intelligence Services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new sites for verification if there were reason to suspect that Damascus was not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with an agreement brokered by Russia, destroy or render ineffective all facilities for the production of shells, gas and fluids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-explosive mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
It requires the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable for action, which will take two weeks to eliminate it.
The OPCW Field Operations Manager, Jerry Smith, stated to the BBC that its inspectors had "personally observed the destruction of the equipment".
"They are no longer able to produce or mix chemical weapons further," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the factories for the production of projectiles and toxic substances were either destroyed or rendered unserviceable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult" because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, there was no time to celebrate with the inspectors yet - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage "has gone awfully far"
John Kerry has shown a relaxation of U.S. surveillance tactics, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US espionage "has gone unbelievably far away".
The Secretary of State also admitted to being guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on autopilot at the time of Edward Snowden's loud revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken some of the things that are happening on autopilot because that possibility has already existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war and, of course, on 11 September".
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases this has gone awfully far.
The President is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain himself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good motives and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We were actually preventing plane crashing, building explosions, and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US espionage abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the U.S., said the Chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator for Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration over the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
"It is indeed important for the national security interests of the US that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who serves as the first-time chairman of the Senate's Sub-Committee on International Relations on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
"And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs."
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations included documents released by Snowden indicating that NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence, James Klapper, defended the spying of allies as necessary and said it was an ordinary matter on both sides.
Against the background of that noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be given in the coming days.
According to him, the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "good motive" "hardness" would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they themselves had used for many years.
"As we can change our tracking programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the problems of hostility with regard to the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
Prisoners ' influence will increase in the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (PC) can approve new memberships of the Public Observatory Commissions (PSCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists will increase their influence.
CBOs are public bodies that monitor conditions in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei of Magnitsky and Leonid of Razzaev, the unrest in the Kopei colony - it is through the JNC that most of the high-profile incidents are reported behind bars.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and security lobbyists to control UOC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the JNC, I suggested that the selection criteria should include human rights experience.
"He wasn't accepted, and they made lists without criteria," says Valery Borschov.
Borschov is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a member of the State Duma from the Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the JNC.
The OP Council should vote for the JNC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand applicants competed for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized owing to the absence of candidates.
OP promises to arrange for the recruitment of vacant seats.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few competition committees, despite the fact that the new membership will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borschov, in the current composition of the capital commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 Silovists, and in the OP voting option, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to join the capital commission.
However, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a representative of the "Fraternity of War", may re-enlist.
He had been a member of the JRC for three years, but had never visited a prisoner.
Borschov believes that by appointing his Chairman, the Sylovists will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the Silovists was coordinated by a member of the United Kingdom, Anton Flowkov, who headed the "Russian officers", an organization that defended the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies at night," said the RBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denies that he lobbyes for the promotion of any lists and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Flowerkov, he wasn't even interested in what list they were now voting for.
He sees Borschov's disclosure as a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chechen ONC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Kopei riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the local commission ' s management had ignored the prisoners ' problems.
But the Rostov-on-Donu PNC can move from human rights defenders to law enforcement officers.
From the new lists, the local commission's human rights defender was "disappeared", but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had ruled him out for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov Commissions of Borschov consider it "a part of the Copiske."
The revelations of Hope by Toloconnikova did not affect the NKK Mordova, which is considered "force": there was only one human rights defender who wanted to join the new team, and she did not even receive the documents for the contest.
Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he resented the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Pavel Goosev, said that he had voted in favour because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
Listing was coordinated by Deputy Secretary Vladislav Grib of OP, who is also a member of the FIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBC Daily that he did not think it was right to divide candidates for human rights defenders and law enforcement officers and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom does not predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman filing an appeal against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of filing a false suit following a Thai police report that a local taxi driver had carried out an attack on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men were holding her.
However, surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment at the General Prison on the outskirts of Phuketa, rather than at the women ' s adult prison.
She is the daughter of a former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who approached the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very concerned" about their daughter's well-being and waited for her to return to Australia.
"It is obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her conviction and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Kraby resort zone in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the launch of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Let's remind you, this is his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Lane", "The Russian Booker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Big Book."
And last year, the writer was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation for this book.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the present 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosaics.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern-day stories and stories has generated a heated debate among critics of all kinds.
It can be argued that the combined articles on prose and publicist Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the debate about "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," Sergei Chuprinin said that it was mostly said that participants understood the word "literacy" as seen in the present and future not only of our words but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles tend to be reduced in the sections "Abzats...".
