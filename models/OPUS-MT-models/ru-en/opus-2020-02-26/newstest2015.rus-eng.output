FANO Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO), in cooperation with RON, will hold the third Expert Session on "The Assessment of the Performance of Scientific Organizations".
The meeting will be the final one in a series of meetings held by the Agency during the year, and will be reported in a press release to Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the Expert Session during the year and to establish a final list of indicators to measure the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the assessment of the work of the scientific panels and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to develop a common approach among the three academies on how to measure the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the normative documents is being negotiated.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said the head of the Russian Federation's expert and analytical office, Elena Aksenov.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than one hundred Russian scientific institutions.
It is expected to result in the adoption of a resolution.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at the city of Moscow, Soljanka Street, home 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysicists from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulence and its effect on chemical uniformity in star formations.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will allow for the search of the stars for related, i.e. arising from a single cluster.
The results of their research were published in Nature magazine and are briefly available on the university website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulence in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of the stars.
Even if the birthed star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its birthplace and its region of formation.
Previously, scientists questioned whether the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Astrophysics modelling results show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer experts modelled two interstellar gas streams that together formed a cloud.
This object has been transformed into a cluster of protostars for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists added paint marks to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud would lead to a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that they can look for chemical stars and identify possible regions of such objects.

Lavrov: Russia will not slam the door because of the new sanctions and will not leave WTO
Russia will not slam the door because of the new sanctions.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, said this today in his address to the students and teachers of IHIMO.
With regard to our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasise, because everything has to be calculated, he said.
And when we figure out what the European and American partners are gonna be like this time, then we're gonna decide how to answer it.
It wouldn't involve slamming the doors, some kind of grudge, misunderstandable, the Minister pointed out.
We will, first of all, build on our interests, our interests, our economies, our social spheres, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of the partners with regard to their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions are very good at judging what partners are trying to achieve, and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation has continued.
If they say, "They'll be painful for us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," that's probably not very adequate.
As far as WTO is concerned, the Russian Federation ' s withdrawal in response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this toolbox to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping while applying anti-dumping measures against sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are prepared to engage the WTO mechanisms in order also to defend our position that the third EU energy package should not be applied retrospectively," said Lavrov.
How do you use lilacs properly in garden design?
Irina Okunev answers the questions:
As liquor loses its main appeal after bloom, it is desirable that it be planted with other shrubs.
It fits perfectly with many cultures.
And you can and should plant both plants that are decorative in other times and bloom at the same time as the siren.
Another plus siren is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a bayonet tree of different heights, improved bushes, a large base bush, and even like a garden bonsai, a tree with a strangely curved stem.
Just pick the shape that fits the design of your garden more.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad province was convicted for selling counterfeit money
According to the national Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonets and Segges districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting in Vologodsk province, where he was sentenced in spring of this year to two and a half years ' imprisonment.
The man later appeared before the Olonets District Court.
In order to complete the investigation into the crimes committed in our Republic, he was transferred to Segeju.
The investigation proved guilty of several episodes of counterfeit money sales related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file containing the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment with four years ' imprisonment in a general-security colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Remember, last week, two other dealers of counterfeit money who paid for them in Petrozavodsk stores were convicted.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each has a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
Archangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy, "Dervish".
The workshop, which took place at the district centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Derwish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial meeting took place at the mortgage stone to the future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on the side of the Sedov coast in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of the Veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the Cadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when the mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a celebration, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned to the sea," noted Boris Karpov, president of the Council of Veterans of the North Sea Ferry.
The event was followed by a town's spiritual orchestra, and cadet class students gave flowers to veterans and marched with Russian flags and the banner of victory.
The process ended with the laying of flowers to the mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
There were also military equipment and weapons on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, and 15 Harrickain fighter aircraft, in dismantled condition.
The escort of the convoy consisted of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of the ships was not discovered by the enemy and reached its destination, Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and some 50 military vessels were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill that protects the organization of trade unions as civil law.
"Where are the trade unions, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, the Minnesota Democrat, who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Fracture.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers Empowerment Act, along with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against the organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of the opposition to trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act to allow workers facing discrimination in organizing trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison and Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are offering is to remember a very American thought.
Despite attacks by trade unions in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracies had been replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role played by workers and their trade unions in forming the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to act collectively is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhauer and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures to that end will be declared illegal.
When the former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everybody has the right to organize and join trade unions for the protection of their interests".
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the union movement did not undermine the power of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions wonderfully created a market for industry and raised a nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers as well as we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are restoring ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could close down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the entry into force of the Louisiana Act, about which his supporters say he is likely to close down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed into effect by Governor Louisiana Bobby Gindall in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would have to have the authority to receive patients in a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
Nevertheless, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could continue to perform legal abortions by continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise authority," wrote Judge John de Gravelles in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month, at which the judge will issue a more permanent decision on the law.
The right to abortion advocates were pleased to meet this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
"Today's decision guarantees that Louisiana's women will be protected from a sneaky law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed an action to suspend the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not been plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admission.
Louisiana is a member of 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
The right to abortion advocates, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performed abortions in Louisiana had the authority to see a hospital, said the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were to stop doing this, the team reported that the doctor was afraid for his safety to stop doing it.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors who performed abortions while their applications for admission were pending.
The effect of domestic product quotas
At least half of the products for each product in the range of trading networks should be Russian-made, according to State Duma deputy Oleg Nealov of Justice Russia.
The parliamentarian has drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers and is writing the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia; for the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the Riteiler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," Nilov reported to the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, setting a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trading networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of Taxic, a member of Sergei Litvinenko, the independent expert centre "Public Doum", for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the impact will be positive and will lead to growth.
There'll be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will be entitled to dictate their terms and prices to the RTs, since they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase fiscal revenues, create new jobs, expand some industries, absorb some faster, contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, though not immediately," the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to break into local shops due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been freed and can breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary harmonizations and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, it is now a time of calm when the previous players have already left and the new players have not yet arrived.
Nearly a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials as well as the rise in the prices of finished products," said Aife.ru, First Vice-President of the Russian public organization Rossian Club of Financial Directors, K.E. Tamara Kasyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to secure the sector to local producers.
In that case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were less expensive with subsidies from another State.
In other words, the competition for the buyer will take place between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova points out that Russian producers are not able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots in all respects.
And in this situation, trading networks will have to push Russia's share of goods to half the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that poor goods will reach the counters.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied as produced in Russia," the expert adds.
The negative effects of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit more from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer from this situation, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The point is that some Russian-made products may be of less quality than imported counterparts, while shops may be able to raise the prices of the second as scarce goods.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again discussed by economists in February this year because of the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of a difficult relationship with the West, the question of giving up imported products becomes even more urgent.
The Act is intended to require Riteilers to treat domestic producers when making orders to suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system for the necessary products will be set up in a shorter time frame," says Deputy Oleg Nealov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really capable of fully covering the counters of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can also gain a strong boost.
As is known, the largest share of imports remains for beef, ranging from 30 to 35 per cent.
So 65 to 70 percent is still Russian," Kasyanova says.
Experts were of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products would facilitate and could accelerate import substitution.
However, this initiative alone will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, I am sure of Litvinenko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, which meant that full import would not occur, but significant steps would be taken in that direction.
Moreover, few quotas had been set, and domestic production had yet to be established in order to meet those quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees," the expert notes.
Untimed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis.
The lead researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Research, QIMR Berghofer, reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in the regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
STUDY: New drugs can slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the medical path of the women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedical services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank of Elise Neev was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
A new FAP will open doors in the Kugener district in September
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibeliak began in April of this year and was carried out according to a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of Head Mary Al, funding for the construction of the facility was provided from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility is almost 230 square metres.
Health care will be provided to the inhabitants of eight localities: the village of Toktaibeliak and the villages of Dementjevo, Püncherumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybeliak, Shinur and Cushkaal.
The new obstetrics centre will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources and does not meet the sanitary requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in a drunken state, the new booth will be brought to justice.
The woman of Chuwashia will be on trial for the murder of her own child.
In the Cheboksars, an investigation into the criminal case of a 31-year-old Novoboksarsk woman accused of causing death by negligence has been completed.
The investigation found that, on 26 July this year, the accused, along with her four-month-old son, had come to Ceboxara to celebrate the birth of her kid.
After a long dinner, the New Bocksard decided to stay and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunk woman put him next to her bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son and died of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the SCR on Chuwashia, is referred to the court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-measures by the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fall short of the government's projections, and the analysts of the BTV Capital are convinced.
According to the experts, the delayed effects of the anti-sanctions will result in inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing to RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to the Commersant, this week IER is expected to make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic outlook by 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could reduce the inflation estimate for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected zero growth in income.
The forecast assumed that the Russian Federation ' s food sanctions were in effect for a year, until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said the source of the newspaper in Minfin.
Economists from the BET Capital do not share the Government's economic and financial bloc's expectations of inflation and forecast price increases of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SNC) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, and experts are convinced.
The inflationary peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual rate of price rise will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat gave the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced "cautious sanctions."
Aife.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analysis Department of the FC AForex:
Price increases are already observed in the main segments of the products.
Moreover, when socially important products became valued, the Government had to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of undue price increases in the short term.
Vendors and RTs already report on a daily basis to the regulatory authorities so that the authorities know exactly who, when and why the price increases are initiated.
The enormous rate of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megareguator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia remain key factors in the growth of the consumer price index.
If inflationary pressures had remained under control, the price of a basket of minimum products would not have jumped by 12% per quarter.
The ban on the importation of food products caused a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since at this stage we are not able to fully implement the mechanism of import recovery, as well as to increase the Russian market ' s self-sufficiency through domestic production, the response sanctions will continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth.
If fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth are added, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, in zero terms it was also above current levels, another matter, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation will be between 8 and 8.5% at the end of the year.
Plato Magut, Managing the assets of the Magut Foundation.
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if there is further pressure, especially on the financial sector, it may lead to some difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which usually manifest themselves in buying cash in order to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the Russian Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by State regulation.
But price increases have traditionally begun after summer calm and may become more tangible this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5 per cent is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
The horticultural centres are sad about the decline in the number of homeowners.
This decline, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may result in gardening centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core age of horticulture", according to a study by HTA, reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It refers to the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting in front of the parking house and the reduction of garden size as other threats to the industry, which is estimated to sell £5 billion annually.
In Greater London, where homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, Britain's lowest expenditure on horticultural products per household.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Bartaire, chief gardener at RHS, said, "Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of horticultural retail trade as a result of an increase in homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out a mass clean-up at the Land Development Foundation
Three of the four heads of the Earth Foundation were replaced as early as Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Earth Foundation were replaced as early as Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Dobrev.
Lozana Vasiliev took his place.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund had also been quietly replaced on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelova, who had been in charge of public assistance and the SAPARD programme until then, reports to BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I didn't attend the foundation's board because we're not legally members of the board, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation isn't reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I find out more on Monday," said Angelov's publication.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the head of Investment Credit at the central fund at Earth in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he had been responsible for direct subsidies to EU fields.
Zivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Earth Foundation in the city of Grand Tyrnovo until January 2014, will be appointed to his seat.
Only Alija Alieva-Velia, deputy head of the fund, kept her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls an American diplomat in connection with a report of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent reported that the American attorney of business and Turkish officials had discussed the communication on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdoğan underestimated the importance of this message by saying that all leading countries spy on each other.
Previous reports that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target of intelligence have provoked a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The biggest Chinese companies have united against Alibaba.
Chinese companies, among which the largest commercial real estate developer in China, the Dalian Wanda Group, and the Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Albaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Greatest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion Yuan (US$ 814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will belong to Wanda and 15% to each of the Internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
It is planned to register a firm in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine Baidu search engines with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fancy hotels, Wanda runs at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a theme park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the coast of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition to this, Wanda owns the American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings cinemas, making the company the largest camera operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda is planning to equip all its trading centres, hotels, and entertainment places with e-commerce services, which will be developed by an Alibaba competition.
According to Dong Ce, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of e-commerce users of its services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet to enter normal offline shops or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "pie" in the online business," said Wanda Van Jianlin (Bloomberg quote).
"There is currently no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the odds are roughly equal," he says.
China's Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple by 2015 than in 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, with Bloomberg reporting official statistics: more people in any country in the world, except India.
By 2015, it is projected that this number could rise to 850 million.
The Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten was, until recently, the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire Index, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already beaten him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Babu's head, Robin Lee, is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is number four.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: the three richest men are united to challenge an even richer man," said Bloomberg, director of China's Electronic Commerce Research Centre in Hangzhou Tsao Lay.
But he doesn't think the new company can really compete with Alibaba as soon as it's created: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not easy to compete not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is evidenced by the report released the previous day on Alibaba's financial performance in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profits for the period are almost twice as high as the totals of competitors – it has almost tripled annually to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential to generate money, largely because of her mobile applications," commented Bloomberg's report from an analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba on the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, well above the March figure of 163 million.
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before IPO.
According to an average of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be valued at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be held on 16 September.
The Road Show company that preceded the event was launched on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's release to the IPO will be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the Visa payment system has held a record of the amount of funds raised on the US stock market, making 17.9 billion dollars in 2008.
At least half of the food items on the trading networks should be Russian-made, the deputies of the State Duma consider.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
This includes amendments to article 8 of the FZ on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, is that at least 50 per cent of domestic products produced in shops should be for each item.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so that they will be "skinned" to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a low VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of all food items of which Russia is the country of origin, reports the newspaper Izvesia.
On 27 August, a bill amending the Retail Markets FZ was introduced into the Lower House of Parliament, which proposes the re-establishment of farm markets in Russia where small producers can market their products.
Chief Malaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
The chief of the Kalvia police on the spa island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at Magaloufe ' s notorious unbridled drinking centre.
Inspector-General José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street where most of the bars and night clubs of Magalouf are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the National Guard of Spain on charges of corruption and will be questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition of ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said that protectionism by the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Our livelihoods cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer blowing 24 men during a bar race.
Since then, the island's authorities have been trying to stop drinking hooliganism among Magaluf's campers, minimizing the number of scandalous drinking runs at bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers together were fined $55,000 ($73,000).
Maglauf's tourist resort, mainly popular among young British recreational workers, was also the scene of numerous alcohol-related accidents associated with a mad fun known as balcony, when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WENSNA prepared a cold surprise in southern Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city by 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains, including a storm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave out an early portion of spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8 C in the city.
The squash conditions were allegedly one of the reasons for the delay in landing the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but it hit a wind-shift zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to climb during the second landing, and the plane finally landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates from Dubai and the Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two rains.
The calculation of the estimates of the construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry and connectivity of the Federal Antimonopoly Service are being specifically monitored.
The FAS has set up an expert council to promote competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the head of the FAS Control Directorate, Vadim Soloviev, stated that "the calculation of the construction project estimates today is totally incomprehensible".
The regulatory framework makes pricing not transparent and may lead to an unreasonable construction price, is considered by the FAS.
And they suggest that the cost of building public property at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices to determine design solutions instead of current estimates and unit costs for technology operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the mine.
"The replacement of traditional construction estimates with design calculations should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained Vadim Soloviev to the BWG.
Because the estimates now count every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, bad-faith construction companies can bury whole tractors.
In the minstra, they agree with the FAS.
"The first work on the conversion to cost calculation based on the design elements is already available: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of design solutions and to estimate these indicators," told RRT the Head of the Department of Urban Development and the Minstrus Architecture, Elena Zhukov.
The area of road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is far more serious.
According to RGB, the head of the Profi-Invest Construction Company, Anatoly Demyanco, the estimated standards are long overdue, but no other mechanism has yet been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations of the design elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, since construction of buildings often uses very different technologies," he said.
It's no secret the builders are developing in many ways because of the state order.
According to the President of the National Assembly of the Expert Community of Public Order Professionals, Catherine Lesina, today the State is the most solvent customer.
Rosatoma Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering, Sectoral Capital Construction Centre, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competence and that do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market could only be achieved if access to contracts was protected to the maximum extent possible from some manager ' s influence.
The expert board proposed that a State-order system be established in such a way that the same performer could not obtain more than one contract worth more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion roubles.
In the mine, it is believed that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, it would then be necessary to assign the customer as a general contractor, which would result in an increase in the employer ' s staffing and budgetary costs.
In doing so, the requisitioner ' s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work performed by the contracting organizations.
Often, such a breakdown would require the identification of who would be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the departure of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to the lack of interest in receiving a government order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The vice-heads of the expert advice centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eustashenka, believe that the State-ordering procedure has now become a business game for the contractor's attention.
And he gave this example: "A participant in filling an application should indicate "specific indicators" without the words "or equivalent", "should", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "same", "not below", "above", "may", "may", "may", "be", "not previously", "not above", "not permitted", etc.
Thus, employers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of an application submitted by a contracting organization.
Another 44-FZ problem, in the view of Eustashenka, was the need to evaluate the quality of the work through the participant's paper offer as early as the application stage.
When considering a participant's application, it is only possible to assess the contractor's qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been undertaken, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert board was also asked to move the margin income from the top to the bottom so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the State Secretary, the Deputy Head of the FAS, Andrei Carikovski, believes that this is not the case, since it is the general contractor who should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, as Arcady Rykin's famous reprieve "Athelie" would say, "Are there any claims to the buttons?"
Israeli children returned to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was recovering from the fighting.
The start of school was a source of joy and excitement for missile-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and roller coasts before the students arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're looking forward to the future," said Ronite Bart, a resident of Kibbutza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our neighborhood really need to get back to their normal lives.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly she was going back to school "a little weird."
"It's been a difficult time, and we haven't left our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the border with Gaza to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out or left their homes, leaving for safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a piece of Palestinian mine, doubt whether they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which had been hard hit by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to keep you safe."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, were killed in the war, according to the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to substantiate this claim.
Sixty-six soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and it is estimated that 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to a popular criterion, real estate prices showed the highest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Housing Price Index for the Australian Capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reporting to RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a cumulative increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double that of 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Director Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra had experienced government cost cuts, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties on sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high sales rate and the current low-interest conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
How do people live in the oldest house in Ufa?
In the former home of gold producers and miners, Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov, on the street of the October Revolution, 57/1 (formerly the Grand Casanian) 18 apartments.
The 18th - century house has hardly changed since it was built, except for the old age.
The outsiders come here as a guided tour, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice over their privilege of living in the oldest Ufham house whose walls are remembered by Alexander Suvorov's half-lord.
The date of the construction of the house is uncertain, and historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is no less than 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, squeaky ladder.
The doors in the apartments are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the streets are seen in the clears of the hamstrung plaster.
Everything seems to be keeping up with the truth.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in an 18th - century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Lucyanov, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The facility is on state security, but there's no money for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits the authorities have forgotten about.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still very poor, but the foundation is rotten.
Many tenants still go to the bathroom outside and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied with such conditions?!
The road goes right under the windows, not even a footblock.
Tatiana's pulling the curtain.
Now you can see what you've heard before: there's a stream of cars underneath the windows.
You see, the windows are snooping all the time, the windows can't open, and the noise is used to it.
A man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thank your husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, three of us living with our son.
And other families have conditions that are much worse, and the ceiling on the second floor is just over 1/2 meters high.
In contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 of Ludmile Oldestina.
A nice, welcoming woman at the door offers a cup of coffee and a sad smile says:
We have a one - room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with our husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another apartment, and Ludmila's got eyes on the room: anthresoli, two couchs with a "g", one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop on it.
Very close and very little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But there's a regular flow from the ceiling: the water supply system isn't good.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment in a common and amazing way, like an Italian woman whose house is on Roman ruins.
So it's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
That's when they made us a little kitchen in the cottage and a toilet out of the old closet.
We live just where the Demids and their family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, why?
The Ufa Real Estate Centre says privatization is irrelevant.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to resettle us, but it didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
My grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my granddaughter.
Anything's happened in that time.
For example, big rats used to run in the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the fligel, they're about a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed up in the eggs, so it's been so long.
The house is well built, thank you, Demidov!
I guess that's why nobody's been killed by a crumbling ceiling or a swai.
Only the building is still slowly dying in front of us: the planks and logs of the house rot, the floors fail repeatedly, we pour cement, but it's all useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is, under our room, the secret lair and the way to the White River, which were deliberately made by the old men who once lived here so that they could hide from danger, in case.
They were being chased.
Ludmila Starstyna tells them how some historian came to see them, begged them to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give up their living quarters in exchange for his loner on October.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are the four of us going alone?
And at least there's a little hope that they're gonna give us a bigger place.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
The Old Men's family didn't win anything, though.
Ludmila's biggest dream is to be scattered, and the daughter with her 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
So two families had a two-room apartment, instead of the most magnificent ruins that two generations now lived in.
Olesa Karsakov's handsome little girl from apartment 11 and apartment 12 shows the second floor of the house.
Her large family lives there in two small rooms with a total area of 23 m2 called apartments.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
The stunt falls apart in pieces, like window frames, in walls in the kitchen and in rooms, through holes.
The water in the crane is cold all year long.
By going through the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, you can see that Lavrentiev's spouses from apartment number four are the most fortunate.
They occupy the largest rooms on the ground floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
75 squared, three people prescribed.
We live in the very rooms where Suvorov stayed by legend during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lawrence.
The ceilings are high, they're spacious.
One bad thing, everything's cracking at the seams, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have already told me!
The most torment we have with the floors is that the wooden boards have rotted, the ground has literally gone from under our feet.
I've set up the bars, the blades; there's nothing in the room yet, and in the other room, we're swinging, it's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov better than any tour guide.
The gold miner is treated as his own, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the identity was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The heirs of the property are proud of their ancestors, but they don't want to live under the same roof as history anymore.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden carriage spaces, stables, and guard booths that were subsequently demolished.
They wanted to clean up our house in 1968, but something got in the way...
The story was repeated in 2014, again lured into a new home.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran around the right authorities, and suddenly found out that the move to the flats was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something doesn't believe in any of this anymore...
Two years ago, Lawrence went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
The tenants didn't accept it.
It was sent from one table to another, and then, like a joke, it was issued without a signature or a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even had the feeling that our home was long gone in the city's plan, because it was number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like it was already demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet approached the Chief of the Information and Analysis Branch of the Land Administration of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the old-fashioned housing programme.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at the time to destroy all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities - to rebuild all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution - has been successfully implemented.
There are plans to resettle the tenants soon.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is represented among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Houses will be properly shaped to match the one they used to be three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it has been decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, it's not gonna work on Sunday, too much traffic in the city.
Resettling people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash, promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied with their new apartments, which will be the same as the current ones.
Only from another era.
A forest fire broke out in the sea in the wake of the storm.
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the area of the Hunting Land Forest in the Porjor district of the Maritime region.
At the site of the fire, the force and means are being increased.
According to the CGSMS management, the conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Base:
A fire in an unaffordable area found an observer pilot on board an AN-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood residue burning on an old burner.
The high level of land and steep slope above 45 degrees, and the lack of suitable landing landing landing landing sites, create considerable difficulties in fighting.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The airbase ' s Mi-2 helicopter and AN-2 aircraft are very difficult to deliver.
Following the discovery of the fire, four fire parachutists were rapidly taken to the site.
The main task of the specialists is to control the fire and to prepare the site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing equipment.
In the area of luncheon, an additional 3 fire-fighters were delivered by a hunting helicopter to the village.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be transferred to the battle site and reported on the site of the Maritime Regional Administration.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, "Rudi's Rare Records", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in a series of radio 4 shows.
Soundtrack is a mixture of ruggie and rap, and melodies are happy.
Henry, however, had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot of" treatment, and Henry often thinks about his father's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket strike.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such an unsmiley guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry shop in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, it's smokey, it's the depths of the underworld labyrinths with flashes of fire and smoke and lots of soot.
My dad got in the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly singing about himself because he wanted to wash away from the lithium shop.
When I got there, I realized that he'd been doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I started to appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of childhood with no parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It was only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you" thing?
Just stop hugging me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I really, really recovered and had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
That's when I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's change of career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got a critical confession for his Othello, he's been completely dived into the theater.
Followed by "The Comedie of Mistakes," followed by "The Lifts" by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral part of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parody on the stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black parody/coma on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective machine to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny at the New Faces in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to "Black and White Menstrual Show", a light entertainment program in which people "brown their face", Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of want it never to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, objectionable position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning lightly entertaining classic on British television for years and years" was also a "big parody of black people."
Introducing the characters who mocked the black culture in the United Kingdom and praised it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of "Lenny Henry's Show" was aired in 1984, and in the '90s, it was known as, among other things, Chief Chef Gareth Blacklock of the Chef!
Advertisements, documentaries, television series and role in the film took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC show "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling time or turning away."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't say I'm really being taught at school, and I thought it was in many ways the prerogative of white middle-class people with tights and cabbage downstairs.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't say that until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and he got caught.
I have a feeling I can do this.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"Here's what it is, it's a big deal, take it seriously, teach your own text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tight, and I read this play for months and months before we put it on.
And she was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for the disaster, and it didn't happen.
We soon started the "Blood Communion."
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside me said, "You're gonna have to work for 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and said something about me, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry's in the fences at Dachess Theater.
It was hard to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above showing, "This is what you need to do."
He says that, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mind-- all the way through our conversation, we interrupt the flashes of his humour when he starts and ends his impression.
I just decided not to work in a stand-up, because this instant reward thing from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do this, it's gonna be a dead end.
I sometimes work on "Streaming in Apollo" whenever I want, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he's ever gonna give a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road-- I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So this is his new invention?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a funny thing to do.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has started the biometric registration of all public employees in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid will be informed in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they have left the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata has promised to reduce corruption in State structures since he took power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost through payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebushiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants are required to report within the next two weeks to the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure and are reported in a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so for no good reason will be struck off the payroll and reported on it.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - thus putting an end to the problem of "invisible workers", said Ann Waigura, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Restructuring of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the Government", reporting to local news agencies.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them had been involved in corruption detection activities last December, which had been aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been a big event for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yazenyuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony did not take place in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, the huge unified Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastukhov, principal of the school in Slaviansk, where Jazenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Fairhead BBC, she may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a plume of fame from the banking world, the media administration and the inner circle of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership.
Her career began with the consulting firm for the global management of Bain and Co, and continued with Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearson media world.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, retired when a male colleague in a lower position took up a high position in Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Her political ratings are also strong.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former BP head, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall, who became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I named the chairman of a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the upper level of the executive hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outwards as the voice of public anxiety and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost impossible doopoly that needs a complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming in, smashing and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he himself lost his job in the process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be so hard, many people would be happy to see the BBC down, after the re-examination of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, inevitable negotiations on licence value pose a particular risk to BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a share in the world's definitely greatest media business.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that its work covers 96 per cent of households and costs each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is increasing: 53 per cent support it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The models for viewing and using the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman-- I hope it's found him.
Perry from Texas says that a humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
A tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday night, contained an insulting image of the Democrat District Attorney, who is at the centre of criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, where it was disavowed.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it," says a later entry.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the communications asking for comments.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing it.
The earlier tweet contained a distasteful cartoon for the district attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who found the drunk driver guilty in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lemberg wasn't investigating a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ruse.
His strong legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who had served the longest time in Texas's history, was vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from state funds to the State Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County and is involved in the prosecution of corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Veto lodged an official complaint with a left-wing public control group.
Perry's confirmed account sheet is often updated and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry arrived at the fifth party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to rumours that he could get out of the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal state"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeastern England had returned to normal activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of strong demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pageley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday: "From the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, adding that this provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market succeeded during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The city's prices jumped by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, according to the Land Registry, substantially exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
However, the consolidation of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of which have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential "homing tax" before the general election next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons last week warned that April's mortgage market reform, which introduced more stringent loan conditions, would also result in lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of growth in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to weaken.
Meanwhile, transactions fell by a quarter over the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital has proved to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pageley added, "The demand for the right product with a good design and better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have remained on time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year by the end of April, almost a third more than at the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
The annual pre-tax gains rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, and income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking before the company ' s annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pajley reported that Berkeley ' s estimated income for that year would meet current market expectations.
According to a consensus among analysts, profits are expected for the entire year prior to the payment of £450 million in taxes.
The value of Berkeley's shares stood at £23.96 in the afternoon at the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photographs of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the star Hungry Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and convicted the hacker for "involved invasion of personal space."
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted, and they will pursue anyone who publishes the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the photo exchange site of 4chan are believed to have been obtained from a lack of online storage of Apple iCloud, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of the break-in includes the names of a dozen women celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary Keith Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photos are true, although the star Scott Pilgrim vs. All, Winsted, on Twitter, also condemned the break-in.
"He who looks at the pictures that I took with my husband a few years ago, alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis, from Nickolodeon "iCarly" and Victory Winner, denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of me naked FALSHIVKI, people.
Let me stop it in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that Ariane Grande's pop star spokesman denied that the photos, which are supposed to be true.
An exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new love novel and the letter "J" that gave rise to criticism.
They vanished, the best thing to say is, they were gradually falling apart like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy in communication, tense, closed, and perhaps a little annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw an annoyance in himself.
He was as prickly as a jerk, yeah.
The last victim of this cowardice was a little romance from which he expected more than usual to be rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with cracked hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevin thought to be her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a damp but beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, the spiders were sitting still in the baths, the slugs left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was planted with weeds similar to the giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and enchanting, with a complete secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the booker prize's long-list in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevin and Eileen sat by their hands in broken chairs among the tall grass, enjoying the suddenly warm spring day; they both scatteredly connected to the cheap console that provided the country with calming music and soothing news when, looking at its crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song of a long forgotten black artist his father loved to listen to, dropping the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the consoles.
They weren't banned-- nothing was actually prohibited-- they weren't lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
The public taste did what orders and orders would never be achieved, and just as among books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
With this day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and a crude comic voice to celebrate the great feet of Eileen.
Eileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, attaching two fingers to her lips.
That's what his dad always did to stop the letter "J" before she flew off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, like he told him.
Start with "J," forget to put two fingers on your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was expected to do it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz wasn't playing either, even though he wasn't explicitly banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With wittyness, that's exactly the same.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a wit expressed by music.
Although he reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevin knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it accepted gratitude - the gratitude of those who saved fate - for the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean origin were well suited for entertainment and sports by temperament and physical characteristics - and they sang and ran.
Indostan's people, as if naturally talented in everything about electronics, have made sure that no family is left without a functioning electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanitized; what was left of the Greek was filled with plates.
People from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly, when what had happened was that they were afraid that they would be accused of incriminating the flames, that the flames would actually swallow them up next, that they would open restaurants with labs and kales, and that they would not lie down and be thirsty with idleness.
Everyone's in a position.
Since she used to hear only ballads, Eileen was hard to understand how the offensive words she just heard from Kevern could actually be put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevin.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of security.
No word could penetrate the sound insulation of giant leaves like cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She shoved her head unbelievably, closing Keverna's eyes.
In the whole world, there was nothing but a cop of her black hair assine.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying with her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
My legs are too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you just because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Trying to joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the violence that was in the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he did, too, Kevin.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and climbed off the deck, overturning the console and the stream of wine that they had been drinking.
Wine from the buzzard, so the intoxication wasn't an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to shiver like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like you, though.
He felt sorry for her, both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up to him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelagic, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in basic terms she looked like the one here.
The same huge ice-cold ocean hit both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and cranky after what had happened, if their ancestors, smugglers, and destroyers, wandered in rage from the pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First, kissing is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave out - first kiss her and then hit her.
Unexplained, Kevern thinks, because kissing was already a hooligan in itself.
Eileen Solomons has shown the body that he needs to leave.
He came up from the chair like an old man.
She felt the lead burden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, her companion was a man who had himself suffered.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and men at all, even though some of them had raised their hands against her.
The man who turned his back on her, the man who had been ashamed, the man who had fought, all the power to fight had left him. Why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single case until today when she saw it?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her legs.
Twenty years before or so before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at the Offnau, the unofficial public sentiment control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and moderate levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop altogether, given the means and forces allocated to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and much has been done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate the innate aggression of the people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow terrains, where, despite the fermenting spires of churches over the fences, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
Some qualities, however, appear to be inexorable.
The higher the spires, it seems, the lower the passions it creates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of overcome obstacles and declares its passion for the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only does old rudeness keep its grip on both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her research director, reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitiveness, totally acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like the ones you showed me.
It's obvious that you're prejudiced against the church, and what you call "brutal" and "brutal" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural life and energy.
To continue to talk about what happened if it were to happen, as if it had happened, if anything, yesterday, was to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink letters like flamingos repeated the advice that "Ofnau" had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," answered Esme Nussbaum quietly when I made sure that her research manager had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we're gonna find out that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened when it happened.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust at others.
Luther Rabinovitz put his fingertips together in a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" in actions that our grandfathers did or didn't do.
You go too far, and when you talk about them throwing away their "hungry" and "untrust" on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, in understanding the past, that is, in defending the present, we are not talking about "us" or "they".
There was no "us" or "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For which, if you are honest with yourself," she dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else. We agree here.
And if you don't blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it's appropriate or if there's something you can fix.
But why the past, if not to learn--
The past is about forgetting it.
If I can add one word to that--
Luther Rabinitz's pyramid collapsed.
"I will consider your report," he said, releasing her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went on the sidewalk, as the passers-by described, "in a vicious rage."
The matches happen.
Lesotho Army states that no coup was planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Members of the Lesotho Army denied preparations for a coup to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army had surrounded his official residence and had taken over government buildings in Masera, the capital.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attack on his life.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, an army spokesman, stated that there had been no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat from "political fanatics" the police had tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action with several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were prepared to cause chaos," he told the Voice of America.
The representative of the South African government, Clayson Moniel, stated that the army's actions looked like a coup.
"although no one has claimed to have taken power by force, according to all accounts, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces so far have had the main signs of a coup," he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that they were calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing manages the government in the absence of Tabana.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in its unified Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite allegations to the contrary.
Chelsea's halfback, Marco van Ginkel, will be spending the coming season on a lease in Milan, reporting to Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
In the past season, he only went out three times in the London club field.
Let's recall that Milan was previously rented from Liverpool by the assailant Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the eurozone's production sector (PMI) for Markit fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have been affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The figures arrived before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to cope with the eurozone's recovery and the threat of deflation with only 0.3% inflation.
It is suggested that the ECB's head Mario Dragi later this week may give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Even though some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest point of 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of concern, as does Italy's weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
The evidence that the momentum of growth has disappeared mainly from the industrial engine, Germany, and Spain and the Netherlands, also adds no confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to further fuel the fire for analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the eurozone production sector business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone's producers seem to find life very difficult at the moment, because the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly those related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened tension has apparently hit the business - and especially consumers' confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said, "It's more and more like that," that the ECB will eventually have to do some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupol will put a live chain against the militia
In Mariupol, until last week, everything was calm - no one tried to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the people are horribly awaiting the arrival of the militiamen.
According to the literature, separatists are breaking into Mariupol to get to the Sea of Azov - the town of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not yet part of the self-proclaimed republics either.
The Mariupols have decided that the Ukrainian army will protect them, but it has a little force against the well-armed PRD-PRD, and are going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and reinforcements.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood in a live chain, singing Ukraine's anthem.
They're gonna do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and supplies, collect drugs, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are being shut down and banks and ATMs are being shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible seizure of the school, as the children who are still in it are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocities.
Just 10 years after the terrible seizure of the Beslan school, during which 334 people, including 186 children, died, heroically survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be some kind of extreme evil.
The tragedy united the east and west in disgust, which in an amazing way then turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of great sorrow.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school atrocities.
We have discovered amazing young people who have stood up to the scourge, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl who's in the picture trying to get back into the shooting gym.
It was captured in a photograph of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitri Belyakov, when in one underwear he tried to climb back into the shelled gym after a mine exploded.
In her confusion, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Hades said then.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Two months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
There's a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but she certainly hasn't broken it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and it cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who's left.
My friends and I try not to talk about it any other day.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzer Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I've finished my studies and started working.
I'll think about family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see on the Internet a picture of me climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of the bullets, believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture by hugging their mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the baby's hand, and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Dameer told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went free and was in a hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent News of the World), where he was awarded as the Protector of Children from the Barnardo's Foundation by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you I've got him drowning in my mind.
I remember right after I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with gunshots, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the yard with who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he's afraid for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the grief that he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was volunteering at the women's monastery last week.
I so want to help.
I want to be a cop someday and hope I get into the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 kids were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence right after the capture, there were just no kids screaming and running around, and that silence went on for months.
She clearly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then that people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can help.
She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare back then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I keep thinking this world hasn't gotten better in 10 years.
There is now a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news story they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, and he's not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, like he's not obsessed with this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered it-- I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
Didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other war toys, and Damira is now 17, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked back, and I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember yelling to him, "Damir, run, run," but again, I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and ran away.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilin, 17
A boy whose shocking photograph after capture became the defining part of the Beslan tragedy.
Peace: Surviver of Beslan Georgy Ilin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and on the right of George today
His bloody face had a scare mark when he was fleeing death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54 years old, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of her studies before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Into the soul: George's photograph (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgius wanting to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused her?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't figure out how this is happening, 'cause if you ask people, no one wants a war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need it to take decades to forget her a little.
She's affected my health, and I still feel her.
For about three or four years, I've had nightmares about the capture, but now I'm better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym in front of every one of September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I wasn't allowed to be healthy.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist killer
Incredible: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist killer at the time of his capture, but he survived.
During the capture, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb by the feet of a terrorist killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says Georgie, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but was unable to do so because of the damage to his health at the time of the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids can handle bad things easily, and I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, next year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: George Farniev today with a laptop-opened photo of himself in the hospital after he was taken
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm fine.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still, my health prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including my medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second crush was animals, so I went to the vet institute.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning how to treat every animal from cat to cow.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
That's not what children should know, and certainly not what they should be through.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgius isn't coming.
It has to be stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgius is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent over this nightmare, but it's impossible to get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm looking at what's happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could capture all the rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaev, 10 years old
A child who was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter.
Saved: Alynu Tskaev is taking a Russian special forces fighter (left) to safety.
Now she's ten on the right, and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian policeman was taken out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, Kristina's 10-year-old sister and Mahara's brother in the gym of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alenina's mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried, and he and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, has no memory of the capture and has flourished into a smart and happy girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Singzi Kagawa, a halfback who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's "Borussia", noted that he looked forward to being able to return to the field in the shape of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm gonna play for "Borussia" again," brings Bild's words to Kagawa.
I feel really good.
I'm full of positive emotions, and I'm looking forward to getting back into the field in the shape of "Borussia."
Let's remind you, Kagawa moved to the MY from Boruscia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to join the English club, holding only 38 matches in two seasons in the England Championship, scored six balls and gave eight assists.
A man is accused of hitting a girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
A 78-year-old man will stand trial on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a transition in Pittenwine in the East Newke.
The prosecutors claimed that Mr. Stuart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstruther, denied his guilt in Dundee's Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, King's Counsel, set the trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't settle in Vladivostok.
The Duty Free Trade Shop at Vladivostok Airport posted a sign prohibiting purchases from the store to a number of world political leaders.
Don't cook them with perfume, vodka, and cognac.
The store authorities decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Holland, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other prominent comrades would not be able to cook vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from entering an even less accessible facility, the Dietary Diaries of the MGU, as reported by the public utilities website.
Whether the American president had ever dreamed of eating in a diet cafeteria in Russia was unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seemed to themselves terribly witty.
Is there any cheese after the embargo: Beardev gave advice to the farmers
Russia's Prime Minister, Dmitrymedev, believes that, under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to produce the types of cheese they need from buyers.
The board was given during a visit by the South Pisticeptor to Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the Restaurants to refocus on Russian meat, which is of good quality.
The annual embargo on food imports was imposed in Russia on 7 August.
Valentine Maslakov, the Russian team's chief coach, is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their own level, "The whole sport" comes from Maslakov's words.
Third place is confirmation of our sufficiently high level of command.
Pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We have to bear in mind that we weren't preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not obliged our leaders to participate in the Decannation match.
In recent years, we have been second in this tournament, but this season we have a new team.
The French, on the other hand, made a team of 13 European champions.
They did not conceal their intention to win this year, as they have announced many times in public.
But even such a team of competition owners could not stand up to Americans.
I believe, therefore, that the Russians have taken part in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were somewhat lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Of course, athlete is no longer so important for the result, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And as a result, I agree, it's absurd for men to be so obsessed with the tactical masculinity of running at 1,500 m, that they're less than the average level of women's races.
4 tips on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film under water, you have a number of options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soaphouse, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
Whatever equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof chamber, make sure that the cell battery and other compartments are closed tight.
In addition, adjust your camera to the type of photos or videos you'll be filming.
Some cameras and cameras have filming modes or type of object that optimize exposures for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cells are only 5 feet, while others are 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots, because a lot of them aren't gonna work.
Mouses have LCDs that will help you compile pictures, whereas action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it's gonna be hard to see underwater, and the frame will be random.
So do a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial mode that takes a few images with a slightly different display set, use it.
Stay by the surface.
The amount of light drops significantly the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay by the surface when you're filming in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Come closer to the target.
It's a great advice for a land survey, but it's even more important underwater because of dark light conditions.
It's especially important if you're filming an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're gonna have to get close to the target if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze prize for the 2012 Olympic Free Trade Games, Bilal Mahov, could be turned into a Greek-Rome battle.
This was reported by the Chief Coach of the Dagestan Free Fight Team, Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude a sportsman from participating in the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently at the "classics" team meeting, citing "R-Sport" as Sajida Sajidov's words.
In fact, Bilal's juniors also performed both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the Volunteer Championship and the third winner of the Greek-Romen competition, and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since we've been talking about a new phase of our career, our heavyweight is gonna be in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can already play at the Tashkent World Cup if he wins the outfit.
But the decisive word is always behind the coach's headquarters led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to freeing patients from both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him was his wife, an MI-6 officer, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are interested in diagnosis and disease, those who are treated are mainly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
In his struggle with symptoms similar to the flu, he found that he resented his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results are back.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lung shell.
For most of the cancers, it's hard to know the exact cause.
Although some smokers are suffering from lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos, to fibrous construction material that was once called a "monster," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that you can ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommendatory industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipers, construction workers, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But such a calm is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of approximately 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected number of future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now experiencing its deadly effects is that, although asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And mesotheliomas are not limited to industrial veterans.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, put in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we go to school, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, wealth, profession, or age.
The election bastion, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, turns out not to be a rescue.
The House of Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are meant to treat us are the tanks of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a Tube Isolator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy Hospital, where I spent six years on internships," he wrote.
All -- students, nurses, doctors and loaders -- used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
That was a question that, unfortunately, he might have answered in part.
"Of the four doctors who were interned at Gaia Hospital and who subsequently developed a mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only survivor."
How many of us are going to be sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It's so unusual to live this long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can just repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are gonna get the same disease?"
According to a leading expert on mesothelioma in the United Kingdom, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to be extinct, some 900,000 people will die.
Most people don't know they're gonna die like that.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick review of the reports from the courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotheliomas have spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been mistreated with asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I didn't even think it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
As a matter of fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have their name from the word "asbestism", which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that could lead to death.
Brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (accidental) are, however, more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there are strong, albeit indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK].
A staff member, Marks & Spencer, was exposed to asbestos at the company's main store on Oxford Street, London
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of the patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelia, when there is no known exposure to work or home, is likely to have been caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment".
Most of this exposure, he says, is due to the "normal use and impact of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the heart of the government, could have been exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committee premises had been contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibres could have been driven by something as harmless as "strong air flows".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Directorate of Maintenance of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "pure sanitation certificate", it had now recognized that it was necessary to work for £1 billion in the reconstruction of Parliament by improving the electrician and removing asbestos, and that, following the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre in the vicinity rather than in the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules".
It is impossible to know if this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of the people who hasn't been able to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, aged 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day of early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like flu.
He was 45 years old, and he was in the middle of surgery late tonight.
Suddenly, I was getting feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from a pleura, a shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he could not go to work for a month.
Worried doctors took X-rays of the thorax and put on the pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it for testing.
Still, his condition was undiagnosed.
His health had gradually improved and he had returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was in sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to see him with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then, Abbott didn't link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott ' s condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to the team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, the sensor equipped with a camera was inserted between his chest shell and his lung shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about that, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott went into a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom asked him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It appears that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now becoming infected with this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now affecting younger people in unusual occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so it was unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the employees who went through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
For decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place, theoretically, where life was saved for the patients, but a place that threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
The schoolboys put their Bunsen burners on the asbestos stand.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, for the first time many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos standouts.
There were websites that drew attention to the asbestos problem in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things such as floor tiles or shed roofs generally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a huge amount of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Gay Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of the garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis is, when it's known that the disease is incurable, it's enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realize this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from being a doctor to being a patient.
As an countless number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he should have taken.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life - the very act of breathing - that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can be trapped in a plaster, a pulmonary shell.
Asbestos fibers are annoying to the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of needle fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
That's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now ironically, the lead mesothelioma treatment center.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who might have been exposed while in hospital.
When the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treger says, "the breath pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the beginning.
The conventional treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective at mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is a hot issue.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger disagrees.
"It's impossible to carve a pleura," he says.
It's impossible to come up around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very good at chemotherapy," which "acts," but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live long," said Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, turned into a support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Rock Central," he said with joy when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would only extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "scheming to make things a little more positive."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazdunsky, professor of thoracical surgery at Guy Hospital.
"We had the advantage of not wanting directions, I just called them, and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to be directed and approved for funding.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to receive the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally inevitably ineffective, many patients face another financial concern: the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when the company's bad faith came up.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement" according to Morgan, because Lawson couldn't clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After an investigation into his death, the representative of the Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basements in question were removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking lethal exposure to asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades later - has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that on their side is a time that the plaintiffs certainly do not have.
This year ' s response is a major new piece of legislation that facilitates the recovery of compensation for mesothelioma patients, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was created for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about £120,000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, thinks £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by insurers for insurers," he says, implying that the sum is one quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time interval had not intervened and the mesothelioma patients would have been able to trace the companies and file a lawsuit in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "unfect."
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven people dying every day, quick action was necessary.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered to be effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a therapy in which Lange-Lazdunski can boast of as many as 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some kind of power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I had a scan done in March [2014].
There were some spots in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things -- about finances when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get the bad news, you're not happy.
We need to look forward.
Like Ellie's dad, 16, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how to say.
The first time I was diagnosed, I told the girls I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted in a very different way.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a very quick call.
Ellie was more discreet.
She didn't talk much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by the challenge of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as Stephen Jay Gould eventually does) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

During the Second World War, shipbuilding has developed intensively, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of asbestos exposure.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for injury to health caused by exposure to asbestos in Great Britain.
World asbestos production grows to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee for Health and Industrial Safety in Great Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited by law in Britain.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act is in the UK.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in low-cost construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production has remained at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run for election in 2017, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to mark the beginning of the long-proclaimed protests in the Hong Kong business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It hasn't deceived our expectations, but it does enrage us," said the legislature Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular nomination of Hong Kong's leader for election would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to elect by vote the head of Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to a direct vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in their hands with the help of the Beijing-controlled nomination commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when one of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong over many years occurred.
A major part of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to cut off Hong Kong's financial region unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
During the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise at the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement had "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could be taken only if all possibilities of dialogue had been exhausted and no other choice had been made.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, every opportunity for dialogue has been exhausted and that the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing ' s statement for several days, and security measures involving police and barricades had been strengthened at the Government ' s headquarters on Sunday.
The riot is based on the feeling in many Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland have increased competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put Hong Kong's life-force source at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long," said Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
It's a perception that's bad for investment.
Chinese state-owned media also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong's democratic activists were exposed by saboteurs sent by Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshmen were asked to come on a private plane.
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the first Lux Travel Service in the UK for current students.
In order to leave a strong impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers such transport options as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year's students get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company's representative reported that, as the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks".
The company also stated that despite the need for students to pay £9000 per year, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever is to make an excellent first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Student Union has criticized this service as being disconnected from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NSS for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly distant from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep pace with the rapidly growing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking thousands of pounds out on some sort of easy arrival in the dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed youth was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the murder of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peres noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left the commentary had placed the gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Peres saw the answers of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the murder of August 9, personal essays with headlines such as "the thoughts of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis that we've been facing, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so race-related, they felt that it needed to be pointed out.
For an English professor at Ohio Corith State University, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems black Americans face every day but are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'll get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how coloured people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why are women safe to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no bias between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women ' s and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors were doing the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always based on the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
I needed a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white souffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral rights would be effective only for one group, women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of women's voting rights, and the voting rights for blacks were to come later," Hattery told.
Looking back at things like this gives us a clear idea of why coloured women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women achieved their right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the South Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynchings.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "take hold" the problems that black women have been dealing with in generations.
"Really, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideologies took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second-wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A prominent white activist of the feminist movement, Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in protests about racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and the perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls - will be at the heart of change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinham is vouchsafed for more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, author of "Who Stolen Feminism?," said She The People that young men in the United States, especially coloured young people, were "more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson were contrary to the criticism she had previously expressed.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "Standing My Brother" to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, many feminists, including Gloria Steinem, reacted angryly.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem in advancing the mainstream of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border of the country this year, immigration reform came back to the surface - this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to make the issue important to women, she just had to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers ' visas are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are coming back from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich pig house is for sale.
A photograph of the house on sale in Suffolka was taken by real estate agents when it was shown as a large pig resting in the living room.
Sold for £120,000, a separate house with one bedroom is on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a picture of the living room, which showed a pig with a head lying on the couch.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photograph was the home pet of the owner of the house.
"But the photograph was mistakenly placed and has already been deleted", the company's representative reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as "a unique single house with one bedroom".
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still in advertising materials.
The sale of the house generated interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open, who replaced Caroline Woznski, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to complete the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, and she sends Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How do you generally assess your performance at the big helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the finals of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even make it to the quarter-finals.
What tasks do you have before the end of the season?
After the unfortunate defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I've got a lot to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to complete the year with dignity.
The Asian tournament series starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolai Valuyev, offered to grant scholarships for admission to higher education.
In general, he said, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times - people would pass the standards for pull-up, running, and other exercises.
It will be recalled that 12 Russian entities will begin to implement the rules of the TEG on their territory as of 1 September.
I also suggested to the students who had given up the UTOs to grant scholarships when they entered the university, noted the Valuyev.
For example, they can add some points to the EGE.
There are also suggestions to provide additional time-out for employees of enterprises who have undergone these sports tests.
A new millionaire appeared in Harvey, South Wales, after winning the lottery.
The lottery player from Harvey this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday night.
The Harvey newsstand brings gold to the main prize for the second time in five years, and last won $1 million in November 2009.
But the lucky winner still needs to make a statement.
Steve Forward, the owner of the shop, said that the winnings had caused an agitation in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the winnings of the major prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, followed by a huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple have been playing for 20 years and reported that the winnings have given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house.
A billionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners to 59 in Western Australia this year, with a total of $85 million.
MINE wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market.
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, described the deputy director of the Ministry's department, Oleg Plütrnikov, on a round table that held "Vedomis" on the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan was prepared on behalf of the Government and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted at the end of September to early October, says Pluričnik, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - there is already a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia.
The plan (a copy of which is available to the Reporters) is for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be available by December 2014; a concessional credit and lease scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, promote localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulations to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (parks, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to regional authorities during 2015 that they also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport, in the form of advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016, proposals for the expansion of public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will have included in the list of performance indicators for regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is just emerging, with about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import tax on electric vehicles was over, so sales would be about 500 grand, predicted by the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But five-fold growth does not make the electric vehicles any more visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million cars and light commercial cars were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors have imported electric vehicles into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports, a company that focuses on corporate customers, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nikola Remiz.
Most other electric transport producers have taken a wait-and-see position against Russia.
The Russian manufacturers also have electric vehicles, such as "", GAZA, "", but the output is tiny.
For example, between January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AvtoVAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, and the director of Autowaza for the engineering of Sergei Amanov admits, without the help of God, there will be no breakthrough in this segment...
The development of Russia's electric vehicle market, in addition to the high cost of machines (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average twice as much as those with internal combustion engines), is constrained by the lack of a charging infrastructure (fuels - units), and the Director General of Avtostata, Sergei Celikov, sighs.
Owing to the high cost and low rate of reduction in the cost of electric vehicles, the Russian market will remain a niche for the next three to four years, and the editor-in-chief of "Authorevu" Michael Podozozhanskyi is projecting, and the Celikov agrees with it.
By contrast, car manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, most importantly to build consumer confidence that "electric mobility" is real; this will be facilitated in particular by the emergence of new charging stations, as highlighted by the president of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rosseti State Company: several stations have been built in Moscow, and some 80 more will be available soon.
Negotiations on the construction of a refuelling network are ongoing with other regions.
According to the director of the Rosset Department, Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles with different brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not authorized to sell electricity and is being explored for charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of support for the formation of an electric car market in Russia to be customs duty-free.
The zero rate will remain in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and extending the concessional list is being explored.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as the customs preferences Pankov thinks.
Transport tax is small in Russia, says Pankov, unlike Norway, for example, where tax cuts led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles - they now account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as already done in Moscow), confident Pankov, or the possibility of electric vehicles moving along the designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, United States.
Three of the five people in it have died, passing on ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometres from the runway of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, prisoners of the Donbas battalion are being dealt with.
The cartels were surrounded by Ilowaysk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of silves died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was really like in south-east Ukraine, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Cartels from the Donbas battalion survived the meat chopper that hit them under Ilowaysk.
In the midst of the Donetsk People ' s Republic army, the fighters spent several days actually abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When the headquarters reported that the "ring" could be removed from the said corridor, the convoy moved.
But in just a few minutes, shells and bullets were hanging from all directions.
"On the basis of the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the Deputy Battalion Commander, who has the call "Lermonts."
And when we went downstairs between Naples and Chervonoselle, there was a crossfire from anti-tank guided missiles, "crays", rocket-propelled grenades, 30-millimetre, automatic BMD guns, and small arms.
There were four cars in front of me, and there were three behind me, and there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call "Lermonts" says that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, and many died after.
The survivors are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" are treating them well, giving them food, medicine.
While their own commanders had actually deceived them and condemned them to death.
They say, "We have been betrayed."
Colonna, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
Alexei volunteered to the Donbas battalion, like many of his comrades, because Ukrainian news reported atrocities that were allegedly being inflicted on the south-east by the "Separatists".
This is where Alexei saw a whole different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not anyone, but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar attack, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, said one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already arranged with the commander, and I've already written a report about the departure.
Zurahovo took us straight to Ilowaysk.
According to the prisoners, a 300-350 man was trapped in the "cotta" under Ilowaysk.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would never have joined the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the DNR.
Everyone will be vetted for war crimes.
A food price control headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyarsk province to limit the increase in the prices of products in the region ' s market, if necessary.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The staff consisted of members of the provincial Government, the executive branch and the supervisory agencies.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the province.
Will Kiev's Rosnefty pay $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company estimated the damage from the US$140 million fire on the Lisician NPP in Ukraine.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and we'll negotiate with the Ukrainian government for compensation," said Sechin.
According to him, the upgrade of the Licičan NPP was planned to be put into operation in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no "exploited rebels," but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
Also, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has gone missing," he said.
It will be recalled that on 18 July, the oil storage tank was burned down in connection with the firing of the Lisichan NPP and two warehouses were destroyed.
The Libyan NPP is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of which was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan NPP is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro 4 fuel as well as a Euro5 diesel batch.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisician NPP were suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start repairs at the plant.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisician NPP along with other Ukrainian assets of TNCs-XB.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time on the part of Chagando Province, which is located on the border between North Korea and China.
As Interfax told the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, the missile allegedly landed in the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 kilometres.
The Rube falls against geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3 cops to 37.15 rubles, and the ruble fell to the currency basket against the backdrop of geopolitical tension.
ETS bidding at the dollar started transactions at 37.11-37.2 roubles/US$1, an average rate of 37.16 roubles/1, which is 4 cops higher than the previous closure in two minutes.
The euro rate was 48.79 roubles to 1 euro, which is 3 cops higher than the previous closure.
The price of the currency basket added 3.5 cops to 42.395 rubles.
The U.S. dollar is bid 23 cops above the official rate, and the euro 16 cops above the official rate.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to be cheap and ruble, and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are already responding in advance to the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like an artificial hysteria that's blown up through the media, especially the Westerns.
The options for imposing new sanctions on the Russian Federation are not many.
TeleTrade "At the opening of Moscow's stock exchange, the ruble continues its sharp decline against the currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negative in the near future, Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be suing The Perfect Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines brought Ideal Tour claims totalling 4.7 billion rubles.
These are two cases that will be held in October.
The cases will be dealt with by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on 14 August.
It's just over 425 million rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's worth 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.
Journalists in the Russian Travel Union have been told that there are different appointments of judges.
In July, the media released information on Ideal-Tura's debts to the Orenburg Avils, amounting to 1.5 billion roubles.
The airline's CEO, Victor Zükin, is referring to the sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
The CEO of "Aeroflot" Vitaly Savelev calls it an even larger sum - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting to new users.
Twitter Microblog Service has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now view a large number of service-recommended accounts at the time of registration in order to form their own reading circle.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated upon registration.
Twitter automatically ticks all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take his own checkers off so as not to read anyone he's not interested in.
While users of the microblog service have previously seen only the avatars of recommended users, Twitter is now producing a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help impress the person.
This is the biggest change on Twitter's Twitter page in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been actively working to modernize the service.
This activity is related, first and foremost, to the service's continuing efforts to achieve unprofitability.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in readers ' activity.
The company is now desperately in need of more loyal consumers who would have stayed for a long time once.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The knowledge day in Moscow will be bald and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, reported by meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow is between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Pomoskovje between 13 and 18 degrees.
If the weather is clouded with clarity, it will rain, and the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3 to 8 metres per second.
Motor vehicle disposal programme resumed on 1 September
A car recycling programme has been in operation since 1 September in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As Mr. Denis Manturov, head of the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, explained, money is being allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would range from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per truck.
Previously, Russia had a similar car recycling programme.
The main difference in the current project, the Minister explained, is that it is now not only intended to dispose of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also that if the car has reached the age of six, it is possible to purchase a new one at a discount when the old one is handed over to a dealer, the Interfax.
The previous federal recycling programme, which was in effect from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2011, was spent over 16 billion rubles.
As a result, the car production rate in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent in relation to 2009).
The Creator Coming Out Simulator will release a game about contemporary journalism.
The game designer Nikki Case, known as Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game on contemporary journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has only become widely known now.
The inspiration for the game came from events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a title, will be how information coverage of stories affects their effects.
A game hero, a civilian journalist, will need to take pictures of what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
A hero can take different pictures of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the cops look like heroes and the protesters are bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him go where a normal person can't go.
If he did not cover the events otherwise, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will need to be picked up by a Twitter hero, which will include new subscribers if the photos posted there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of its release and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photograph of it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keyes, he explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but he originally wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who issues browser games.
The most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events from Keyes' own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to communicate his relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletei is dragging Ukraine into further bloodshed.
In an appeal to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence, Valeri Heletei, has drawn the people into a bloody confrontation, as reported by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military agency, Valerie Geletei, who declared "the conclusion of the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "great domestic war", in which "tens of thousands" would be lost.
The adequacy of the head of Ukraine's military department, who published the post on his Facebook page, a subject for the study of specialists in the non-military field, is stated in a communication from Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
However, he stated that the "operation for the release of eastern Ukraine" had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all the intimate pictures of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been struck by terror.
The hackers hacked the iCloud passwords in smartphones, and then their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
It won't be long.
As a reminder, Jennifer Lawrence, the official representative of the Star of the Hunger Games, has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all the images that shine on the Net are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the same name tabloid website, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her workshop colleagues for publishing their candid pictures, writing The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do that.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm gonna delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justis," the blogger tweeted.
However, all frank photographs of the stars have already been scattered online.
David Beckham was in a car accident hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident fleeing the paparazzi.
It happened in L.A. at a bend on Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer suffered from bruises and muscles of his right hand.
Beckham came out of the tattoo, where he was waiting for the paparazzi.
Sneaking away from their pursuit on a motorcycle, he failed in the steering curve and fell, writing TMZ with reference to sources close to a football player.
As a result, Beckham sustained a contusion, a tensile muscle of his right arm, and a scratch.
Tony Stewart is in an accident when he gets back on track.
Tony Stuart's return to the track ended slightly more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre broke into 172 laps, putting an end to his protruding.
Stuart drove his van to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said 14 members of the team were upset, but now they're gonna focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after the clash with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a rather great hope of getting to the finish line," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on the tow truck, and the team was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a dirt race in the north of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either at Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the persecution.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that had led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who was on the road to express his dissatisfaction with Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would last at least two more weeks.
The decision as to whether Stuart would be charged was not made.
The three-time champion was met with loud voices and applause when he was introduced before the race.
After starting from position 12, Stewart was in the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching position four.
Then on 122 laps after the restart, Bush's number.
Car 18 came off the trajectory at the exit of bend 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but fell back to position 21.
Sobchak and Vitorg are having breakfast with Zhunetsky in Odessa.
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Witorgan are now in Odessa, something that the TV host has not hesitated to report to her Instagram.
True, one picture was very surprising and embarrassed by the couple's fans.
It's taken from Zvanetsky.
"At Michael's Michalich's breakfast, Zvanetsky Maksim explains what an instagram is:) #Podessa," signed a photo of Xenia Sobchak.
But nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter...
The couple's fans thought Xyusha was smoking, too, and convicted her for that.
"Whose cigarettes?", "Crust kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast" (I think it's breakfast and only cigarettes on the table)) ", "Ksenia, you smoke too?", worried about their favorite blog followers.
Remember, recently, Sobchuck bragged about what a delicious dinner she had for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the gym and your husband cooked dinner for you at your house (the first time in a married life, but it's delicious. The main thing is that now at the end of dinner you don't say with the joke, "whatever happens every day now," she boasted to her husband, Xenia Sobchuck.
The picture shows that Maxim is working hard to cook, and there are salts and baked chickens on the table.
Bulgarian prison officers held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also part of the list of claims to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, officers protested symbolically against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the Prison Service Union has met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, as reported to the BNR by Rosen Jeliazkov, head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of Sentences.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the Prison Service Union.
The army controls the new Thai government
General Praith (right) appointed Rheit Wongsuwan (left) to the post of Minister of Defence
The Thai military ruler and Prime Minister, General Pratyt Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers, in which more than one third of the posts were filled by retired generals.
The army has won key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Praute Chan-Ocha was officially appointed Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
A 60-year-old military officer who took power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the premiere.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Praitha Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
Officially, Praute Chan-Ocha will be a temporary premiere, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
There are concerns, however, that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military took power, they temporarily arrested leading politicians in the country, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Thaksin as Prime Minister.
Both were popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which had ensured their success in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said the mussels would be better in the salad, I didn't promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm brassery is joking.
We have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and the stomach remain firm.
'Cause everyone knows for a long time that we say "Belgium" means mussels, we say "media" means "Belgium".
Regulators like to state in depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location, and again location.
There are places like this that aren't good, they're good, but they're bad luck.
Anyway, when I sat down at the Palm table, I remembered that there was once a Cafe Town (in honor of the same TV show), then Odessa Mama, and a restaurant called "Bojole" and a beer friendship.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic Soviet, it's Belgian.
The only place above the ground was the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space being devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun in here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colourful chairs, instead of windows, tvs where the girl mermaids swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg are no longer new, so there's something to compare with.
There are eight beers (260-300 rubles per 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A successful waitress, a company, has a fun presentation of the menu, saying that "medias are full large seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite certain shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected by content, but often very unexpected by execution.
Well, for example, who would have guessed that a meat loaf with a Valonian prune (280 rubles) was actually a carpache, cut so thinly that the parchment paper would appear to be unbelievably thick compared to it.
The only way to taste a taste is if you get half a barrel at once.
It's worse with salads.
Classic Lean (260) would be the most appropriate crime against the Belgian people: some lousy iceberg, once cooked a long time ago, fries dispersing Kenyan beans, bacon fried chips plus for some reason marinated onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with a Leese salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons could still be covered, why would the mussels look like they've had time to unfreeze and boil them a few times in their lives!
'Cause I already know there's some pretty normal white-sea mugs in here!
They're served in pots "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauce, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, didn't go off.
There are vegetables, and there's no smell, and if there was wine, it's still a mystery.
At least they're good for mydies frittes with house mayonnaise.
Chicken water isn't so thick here, you can decide, depending on the mood, the first or second course in front of you, it's just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked by a local cook in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
The opposite is true: the rosemary jammed everything.
The rabbit seemed to have been fed exclusively by rosemary bushes in his lifetime, which gave the meat such an extraordinary fragrance.
But there was a great rabbit attached to the leg -- no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet but also full - beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (520-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be too watery and the waffles dry.
But the manager who approached the table was very informal about the dinner impressions.
Then we should come again.
The dollar's exchange rate has risen to over 37 rubles on the news of the West's new sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
A dollar of tomorrow's 10.29 msk grew by 26.9 pennys and amounted to 37.02 rubles, and the euro rose by 30 pennys to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Exchange.
The currency basket grew 28 cents to the level of the previous closure and was worth 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on 19 February 2009, at 36.43 roubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was 37.005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, both in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
Long-term prognosis suggested this mark," says Anna Bodrov, Senior Analyst of Alpari.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the course in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumours of military incursions are not confirmed on either side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk about him being resistant to this kind of news was crossed out yesterday.
The week is forecast to close at these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles to the dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to accelerate: between 5 per cent and 10 per cent will be added to current prices in autumn.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon run out, and there will be a vacuum as networks shift to other suppliers.
"Dollar went up to 37 rubles, went through it and came back, "there's no big hysteria," comments the head of the Broker Open Market Analysis Department, Konstantin Bushouev.
They will still see if the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Ruble, he said, was severely weakened after the tax season, and then news went on about Ukraine, and the BC said last week that it was going to be completely on the floating course and refusing any foreign-exchange intervention before the end of the year.
When you look at the day swing, it's no different than the previous one during this month, and it's the 37 rubles mark that scared everyone, and the analyst continues.
Well, nothing powerful ever happened in terms of turnover.
The alarming times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when there was a high demand for currency at the end of January, as well as the third of March, when the BC shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, the increase in the revenue share of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers by increasing the cost of imports, says UFS IC Chief Analyst Alexei Kozlov.
Negative developments include the increase in the number of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, trigger inflationary pressures and, as a result, increase the cost of borrowing money, which in turn hinders the development of the country ' s economy.
In the case of the equity market, the depreciation of the ruble has somewhat reduced the decline in the price of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMWS index declined by 1.67% during Thursday's bidding, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative decline in the indices is due to the weakening of the ruble by more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy currency.
Experience has shown that emotions are gradually being lost, and the rouble quotations are either partially or completely restoring lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
Brittany reported that she had spent many years thinking she was gonna die after the wrong diagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Marie-Touta (SMT) disease, a group of genetic disorders that caused nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that the wrong diagnosis was a frequent problem among people with SMTs because so little was known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are believed to have SMTs that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and flexed toes.
The sick may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's (AF) attack, a condition whose prediction was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew with a child that I couldn't do what the others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to skate or skateboard with other kids, and I've been bullied a lot at school because I've been walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the achille tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical records when her doctor left the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I snuck my nose where I shouldn't, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about it in the library, and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and faced the worst panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I'd gradually lose all my abilities in this period.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and had asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have SMTs.
"When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I pulled a lucky ticket," she said.
The British SMT charity has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington area entrepreneurs increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone were no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to state and local governments in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local business increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, the third consecutive year of growth after successive years of account decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the district's tax revenues, 56 per cent, are from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenues are from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the lowest tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the previous level of real estate value of companies, according to researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states such as California, New York and Texas account for a large share of these revenues, the same seems to be happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia together paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on the increase in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely more than one fifth of company tax accounts.
Virginia and the District of Colombia pay about half of state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Center.
So Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the re-establishment of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be being adjusted, according to these figures.
Companies in the region declared a state corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion of corporate income tax revenue, most of all in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
Colombia ' s growth rate was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 per cent, while Maryland ' s growth was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia experienced a rise in tax revenues below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax in three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
Maryland has a corporate rate of 8.25 per cent, while the district has a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and a generally more favourable climate for business taxes than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that reduces the corporate rate from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, as in Virginia, and the rate falls to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax revenue targets next year, the law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to feel better and thus pay more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - the transition structure used by most small firms - in Columbia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much faster rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues from state and local governments rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
Russian judo bronze age
The Judo World Championships brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
The Russians have given up on this figure only to Japan's main competition favorite.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk began on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, who was in a category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final struggle against Baldbaathar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation resolved only one comment received by the Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia, and three medals were won on Tuesday.
In male competitions in the category up to 66 kg, silver was given to Michael Pulyaev and bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russians gave up the 2011 and 2013 World Championship to the Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot at the quarter-final stage, won the comforting tournament and won the bronze award.
In a 52 kg women's tournament, Natalia Kuzütin also reached the third stage of the pedestal.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the current World Championship, Milinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In an argument for the bronze, Kuzutin won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she expected.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had defeated Cuzutina earlier in the finals of the European Championship, was a barrier to the Russian women's journey to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze was placed in Russia's spear by Musa Mushkov, who fought in a category of up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, his abuser was a former Moldavian representative, Victor Skovortsov, now representing the UAE team.
However, the Russian then won two battles and became the recipient of the award.
Mouthkov performed at a home championship where he planned to heal shortly, so he would pause in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skwertsov, he and he made it to the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who had accepted UAE sport citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, had completed his performance in the category of 100 kg.
The fourth day of PM-2014 also brought the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in a category of up to 81 kg.
In the difficult battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a comment from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but Russians traditionally confined themselves to one bronze in a men's tournament to 90 kg.
Cyril Questions was the recipient of the award, and the medal was guaranteed to Russia: his rival in the comforting ending was Cyril Denisov, a fellow countryman.
However, the contraction did not take place: the rival of Questionov was unable to reach the tatami because of the injury.
The men's bronze was won by the owners, and on the sixth day of the competition, Renate Saidov placed it in the pool, with a category of over 100 kg.
In a comforting finale, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
This brought to an end the individual part of the world's premiere.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the world championships were played in team competitions.
Both Russian teams - both male and female - were among the main candidates for the awards, but, like in individual competitions, women of the beautiful sex were unlucky - they didn't make it to the medal.
But Russian judoists won command silver.
In a decisive stand-off, they fought hard against the 2-3 score and gave way to the main competition favorites, the Japanese team.
At the same time, Russia won 2-0 after a clear victory of Khan-Magomedov and the Volvova-Denis Yartsev (up to 73 kg).
In the heavier weight categories, however, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
The same scenario was followed by a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, with 2–0, gave up to 2–3 Japanese.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at the Chelyabinsk team competition, and after the tournament ended, he congratulated the men's silver team.
"Second place is very honorary, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," said Putin, whose words RIA News quoted.
Losing the Japanese, the Judo's natives, is nothing wrong with it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's team at the home world championship was much better than it was a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all big maximists, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let us recall that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in sports such as judo, the Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, quoted by the press service of the championship, summarized the tournament.
Japan's team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various degrees, five of which were gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news, and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
The Joan Rivers family is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in the statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday following an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, reporting to sources.
The doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "hard".
The response was broad, including extensive Internet support from such people as Donald Trump, Montal Williams and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can be kings.
The debut album by Royal Blood is a new hope for the British rock, bringing rock duos out of the clubs straight to the stadiums.
The duo Royal Blood is only on stage for a year, but is already active for the BBC Music Award, the Arctic Monkeys tour, and the New York dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release is in Warner Music's portfolio.
Given the current unfortunate situation in the music market, the situation is out of hand, because it's not the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet voice from the new R'n'B, but the duo of the british-looking British playing with the volume and intensity that was last fashioned a few decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album for all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and had already been fully justified.
The duo has for a reason taken a name that could have been violated before, except for desperate, hairy metal workers, and the blood of which kings they think is flowing in their veins, too, is understandable.
These are, of course, first and foremost the heroes of the past Led Zeppelin: like the great quartte, Royal Blood is designed to shake the stumped blood of the British rock into a new height.
It may be too early to predict the success of this enterprise, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs in 30 minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's gift as a credible and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of the Black" is characterized by what is remembered not by the melodical line, but by the drum party.
Musicians are joking that this song is even easier to snitch than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth is, however, that each of these songs is gonna sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous painting.
And it's not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The power of Royal Blood is that they don't claim to be laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney, but they've taken many rock duets out of the Hetto Indi Clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is designed for stadiums, in a room of less than a few thousand people, it is evident that it is very close.
The secret is part of the trick of using the bass to replace the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of The White Stripes.
It's not just about the tools, it's about the way you write songs.
The retrorocks of the zero were hard to choose beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to admit themselves as independent creative units rather than just epigons.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and insolent that this attack successfully drapes some of the secondaryity and hardness of the music material.
And in the end, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1,04 billion.
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: an online shop - and a video producer, and a hundred other things - buys a streaming video production service called Twitch for $1,04 billion (US$970 million).
This news turned out to be a surprise not because nobody expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch video service to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, based only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a stream service of a general nature, a real-time YouTube version.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers broadcast their intragame moments; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
Interface Twitch.
And "let's play", a video genre in which all-knowing people process (mainly old) games, like in "The Mystery Theatre", is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch has been met with little interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company that buys a potential rival.
It's a secret why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reported that he was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me who say they're better at sports than watching it, it's hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking the joystick into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some outsider get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of vision alone can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I will agree that the speed passes in which the Rogers of the Bannisters of our e-century complete their entire games on record dates are entertaining.
But if it's not a game virtuse or humour, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and it's the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will fold into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to have: a crowd of young men who are dreamed of by advertisers.
As Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not show signs of wilt, even - ooh - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages - almost all of them now students, the parents of the deceased, the Cemetery Keeper, the City of Angels, Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the Mother of Beslan committee of Susana Dudieva, who took part in the special operation by an MES officer - says a reporter from the Society Division, Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser to the North Caucasus and was negotiating with terrorists, as well as with VBK management officer Vyacheslav Bocharov of Russia.
What really shocked me during my work on this topic is that Beslan hasn't been there in ten years.
This subject is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people find it difficult to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we did our job," Antonova said.
A special project has been developed by the Rambler & Coe Infographics Studio, which has been working for the company since spring this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to World War I and Vladimir Putin's 15th anniversary in power.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Japanese Sea, reporting to Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, on the border between North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly landed in the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and was reported to the Joint South Korean Chiefs of Staff Committee.
The deputies proposed to expedite the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law has been submitted to the State for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is embedded in the legislative framework of the lower house.
It was sponsored by the deputies of the State Duma, Vadim Dengin, Jaroslav Nelov (LDDP), Evgeny Fedorov (the only Russia), Vladimir Parahin (the just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, in the view of the authors of the initiative, would help to ensure more quickly and effectively the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to preserve personal data and to respect the confidentiality of communications in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which the parliamentarians are anxious to enter into force, requires that Russians ' personal data be kept on the territory of the Russian Federation and processed on the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and extract personal data from citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian legislation in the field of personal data.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called "blacklists" of offending sites, an automated information system called "Registration of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Dengin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of CLCF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have a date center in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State today, Leonid Levine stated that he saw no problem in postponing the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that would not have their own Russian personal data warehouses on Russian territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, such as "Rostelcoma," which repeatedly said that they were willing to rent their servers and already provided their servers, from Mail Group, Western companies that were already providing their servers."
"There are also several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will have technological accommodation opportunities", Levin summarized.
Dispute Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that many global Internet services would no longer be available to Russians if the draft law were adopted.
These include online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.
In the view of the association, "the draft law deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by making it mandatory that their recording, systematization, etc. be ensured only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
RAEC ' s statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of the location of the recording, to systematize his personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose the territory in which the activities will take place.
The adoption of similar personal data "localization" bills in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
Ice-water tester dislocated the jaw

The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
In Novoroscia's Army, they claim to have hit Ukrainian Su-27 and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
At 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were injured, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
An Interfax spokesman from the Press Service of the Army of Novoroscia reported this.
He added that "a Su-27 aircraft was shot down by air force in the area of Mereška, in violation of ceasefire arrangements".
According to the agency ' s interviewer, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in shelling the Lugan airport.
The spokesman for the press said that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters in one of the field airfields overnight, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The loss of the enemy's life - up to 100 people killed and wounded, 13 captured," was summarized by the staff representative.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the "people's republics" of Donbas announced that 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine had been handed over to the Ukrainian side within the framework of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the DNR army, according to the Army of Novoroscia, "dismissed an attempt by the Nazis to remove heavy equipment from the area in violation of previous agreements".
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two armoured personnel carriers, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to headquarters, the total number of enemy casualties in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) during the night were five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilowayska area in Donetsk province.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
The DNR agreed to do so on condition that the enemy surrender the weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the surrounding localities on Saturday morning.
According to Semen Semenchenko, the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion Donbas, who was surrounded, left the cattle on Sunday night.
Semenchenko wrote on his Facebook that Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity to 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia will respond if new sanctions are imposed by the EU
Russia reserves the right to take countermeasures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, and informs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian foreign diplomatic agency states that the "conclusions" of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unmistakable support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of "absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country", the Department's website.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the Euro Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is influenced by countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the Euro-Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full "dialogue between the warring parties", underlines the agency.
The Department ' s website also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
It will be recalled that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned within the next seven days in the European Union.
In doing so, EU representatives cooperate closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced for the period of validity and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the fields of defence, finance and oil and gas.
Sneaky ways to save money on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to graduate, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system for renting books from seniors, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sale.
"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and a cookie called "Chick-fil-A", says Schroeder, 19 years old, who goes to the Covenant of College in Georgia.
The literature needed last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a variety of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet shops and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
Book rentals are becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and often cost much less than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Studies in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Vice-President "Nibo" Trevor Meyer.
Fewer than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the professional association National Association of University Shops.
Here's an introductory course on how best to make a good deal.
Buying from an Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in a university bookshop.
The ninth edition of "Mathematic Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs about $290 on the list, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used
If you don't mind other people's markings or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical analysis is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casadey, 25, a fourth-year student from Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a second-hand copy of a textbook entitled Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business side of the advertising business.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracy, director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to check with their professors whether previous publications can be used.
Sometimes updates aren't important for class.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Hire
The idea of renting textbooks is to think, if you're good enough to handle them, not forget to return them, and don't want to keep them after you finish the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that you may receive for marking, underscoring, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: If you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
"Mathematic Analysis" on Chegg.com will cost approximately $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to begin his studies at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of a book, as this guarantees that you are looking for the exact text you need.
Before you order on the Internet, Holt says, make sure that there's a book in the warehouse.
This lesson has not been easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the Far East Development Fund was totally ineffective.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called at a meeting on State support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the Far East Development Budget Fund, created two years ago, was inefficient, reporting to Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the President stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the approval of the list of areas leading up to development in the Far East be accelerated.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of stowers was to be submitted to the State this fall.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, did not approve, until 1 July, the list of areas of advanced development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also outlined the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s transport accessibility and removing infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create a framework for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to form the pre-development territories that should become competitive with the ATR ' s key business centres, the President stressed.
Let us recall that it was previously reported that the area of advanced development could replace the EEZ.
Why the galaxy guards couldn't save the cashier's fees?
Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget in the United States, while "City of Sins: a woman worth killing" returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Home video with Cameron Diaz only brought $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's movies like "How to tame Dragon 2" also disappoint the proceeds.
The article "Telegraph Robbie Collin" suggests that when it comes to children's films, it may be the bad quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in history with regard to children's films and called "How to tame dragon 2" a barely "functional" fancy extension.
However, when it comes to films directed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film released in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the May-July 2013 Memorial Day Festival and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year ' s film harvest is similar in size to last year ' s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be a matter of changing visual habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-rent Disney film "The Book of the Jungle", said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit this and not try to chase what happened before.
Unlike the current drop in Hollywood's cash collection, Netflix's revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "cream."
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that his dark predictions included a share of the truth.
As several potential cashier hits are expected in the summer of 2015, including "Avengers: Era Altron", "Mignon" and "Jursk Park", other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer of People X, Simon Kinberg, recently called the drop in cashier's fees simply "cyclic", saying Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the cashier's summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
The product sanctions do not scare the owners of the Kawkaz and Central Asian food establishments, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, the public has so far chosen to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel, and China.
"There's better pickle than bad mozzarella," the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio is crushed about the quality of cheeses offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozartella and the burrat cheese ran out at the restaurant first, and they have a little time to store.
Parmesan reserves should be enough for a few more months.
What do you want to do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomila market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it's clear that shocking memories keep him alive until now.
The meat was on the carts 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
I said then that for our restaurant, we would never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day, I got a taste of fish from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of Italy's usual things are for a Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang out to be soft so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, where did you get such tender meat?
I told you, it's yours, Russians!
Why doesn't anyone do that in your place?
Within five minutes of Barlotti's walk at the French restaurant Brasserie Most, there is a stop-list in the kitchen that shows missing products: French oysters, sea oysters.
The chief chef of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Strelka bar, Regis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
And the Regis gets more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "A cherry cabbage - 200 rubles!
I said, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we gotta make some money, too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy far east oysters by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
At the price, it's superdelicacy.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of fear for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were fine, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot sustain stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know what's gonna happen to them when they're out of cheese.

Sanctions menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to Russia's security, mainly called food sanctions.
Bovine, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, cook, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrup are prohibited from entering the country.
Restaurants have begun to have chehardas with suppliers: food prices have risen, and there is an urgent need to look for similarities from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocouches in France, Italy and Spain, where products were supplied directly from "mother" countries.
The commons had to rebuild before.
For example, in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the importation of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers made deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer-2014 sanctions proved to be much more severe.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the Presidential Decree, which ban Atlantic salmon and trout, milkless, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can be further relaxed.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in an uncertain environment.
According to East-West, one of HoReCa's largest suppliers, imports accounted for up to 70 per cent of the bonus segment.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant owner, the owner of the RestConsalt.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks like this, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: we're gonna have to give up 10-15% food, we're gonna have to rework half the menu.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, they're starting to replace dishes, such as marble beef steak, for beefstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," listed by Oxana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West.
The cream and dairy products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by domestic products, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it would be easier for budget network restaurants to rebuild than a bonus segment: it was unlikely that gourmets would go there to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it would be difficult for Ginza Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menu.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace it," Mironov says.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of the Café of Kawkaz and Central Asian Kitchen emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more delicious than European ones.
But there are a lot of restaurants that have little to do with sanctions.
These include institutions with the kitchen of CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There is no expensive food in Georgia's kitchen," says Khatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe "Wei Mae!"
All the cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use chicken fillets at the base of many dishes, exotic greens."
There's not a single dish out of the menu yet at the Kolbai institutions.
Timura Lansky, who owns the Cheikhon N1 restaurants with Uzbek food, the sanctions aren't embarrassing either: he's only gonna have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia adopted imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he said.
The CIS can be cheaper to obtain tenderloins, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than the plastic from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows they're delicious, sweet.
Nobody talks about Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olimba Artykov, stated that he planned to double the export of fruit and vegetables to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions were imposed.
The fast food restaurants that responded to the request for money are also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
McDonald's press service stated that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, the head of Subway Russia's supply department, the network purchases about 80 per cent of its products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties in supplying vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Termka", "causing products" did not occupy more than 4 per cent at all.
The noodle Walker was not affected by the sanctions.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potato did not respond to a request by Money, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On his hump.
In the meantime, restaurant owners complain that even local products are growing in prices due to increased demand.
"The prices for Grabley's products have increased by an average of 10-15%, "and for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio, they have doubled," says restaurantist Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the meal will grow by 5-10%, Kolbay admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have cost 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork," complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Chicken patches were up 35 percent.
We're expecting prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
Stardogs will soon have a planned price increase of 8%.
It's already very undesirable to raise prices, says Rack.
According to statistics, the increase in general income for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices would continue to rise, he admitted, but it was not clear how fast: while most restaurants had been stocking for the next two months in the hope of waiting for price fluctuations.
But no one knows what's gonna happen in two months.
There are a dozen tents in front of Moscow City Hall, decorated with green and wood.
At the center of the stage, musicians play waltz.
It's a regional food festival with the fun name "Eat Time."
"We were going to do a local food holiday for a long time, and the sanctions are here, we've been moving fast, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
At the stage with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas makes pasta salad and homemade candy, and the other day, there was a master class in caramelized apple wrestling.
All of Russia's products, they're assured by the organizers.
In the tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Baškiria honey, Salehard deer, vegetables from Lenin's Suvhoza, cheeses from a sick Italian Jay Claus.
"The salmon for restaurants can safely be replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of the fish shop "Our People."
We get a nerve, a ketsu, a hunch, a hunchback, a teapot, a king's salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it into your hands, it doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with a domestic one.
In the window of his tent lies shrimp with a Magadan tag, cod, umul, muxoon, mussoons from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to move on to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, in 2013, more than 4 million tons of fish were caught in Russia, and much of the fish went to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
The "Our People" shop has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, serving a dozen more restaurants, such as "Simple Things" before sanctions were imposed.
There are now 15 other restaurants that have applied for Galkin.
We can make the same sushi out of our fish, and it's hot.
We've had a bit of trouble, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling sushi through an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is a few times cheaper, and our delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilo.
To confirm it, I'm getting a piece of Philadelphia with a keta in Galkin's tent.
Unlike the seed rolls, it takes longer to chew, but the realization that this fish, our home-grown fish, is giving us strength.
There's even halibut and sea bass rolls on the website of The People.
In sushi bars, it's true that the Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean.
Galkin explains it because cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with long-east fish.
"Rossian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of the Killfish Bar, Dmitry Euseev.
The situation with other products is similar: Russian producers could take the niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, imports from China, Israel and Latin America are now more likely to be replaced by imports from Europe and America.
There are large multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is to say, the main beneficiaries of the ban are the major producers of other countries," said Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more alarming message than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unannounced inspections, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the nature of the claims in order to determine the actions required to open restaurants for visitors as soon as possible," said Moneygam at McDonald's Press Service.
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it's one option that can survive, says the employee of the restaurant consulting company anonymously.
If McDonald's is closed all over the country, the script will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the HBBD certificate
The Casco payment will be available without a certificate from HYBDD, so the BC intends to encourage the introduction of "europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to get paid for the Casco payment without a certificate from HIDB.
It is true that it is only in cases where the accident was "europrotocol" without the involvement of the traffic police.
So if only two cars were involved in the accident, there were no physical injuries, the damage did not exceed the limit and the two drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the payment limit for Europrotocol is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that, often even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be described as a "europrotocol", drivers who have been in an accident are called to the DPS.
After all, if there was a Casco policy, it was not possible to recover it without a GIDD certificate.
The parameters described in the draft directive are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of "europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for Casco in the event of an accident without the personnel of GIDD should not be lower than the "europrotocol" limit.
However, it cannot be above the limit defined in the Casco insurance policy.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both the DPS staff and the road.
But it's probably not gonna please motorists or insurers.
The latter are already pointing to the serious threat of increased fraud, which could be caused by the introduction of new rules on the payment of the Cascos.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is difficult to imagine what work it will take to overcome Russian traditional conservatism.
The driver will in most cases wait hours for the inspector to get a minor accident done because it's more reliable.
And there's no way that it's gonna be easier to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of "europrotocol."
The savings certificate will make it nameless.
Minfin wants to ban the bearer's savings certificates, but he's gonna let the banks give them an analog of unrevocable contributions.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban the bearer's savings certificates.
Recently, this instrument has gained popularity, as the stakes are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer ' s savings certificates do not enter the deposit insurance system, and the bank is cheaper to pay because it does not have to contribute to the Deposit Insurance Agency ' s (AV) fund.
The risk is that small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates are planning to take this step and that Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow will be affected, which AV estimates are responsible for 98 per cent of the market.
The Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, accounts for about 3.5 per cent.
The problem is explained in the ASB that the customers of a small bank that purchased such a certificate seek to obtain money from the ASB if the licence is revoked.
Some depositors may assume that they are insured if they do not have sufficient financial literacy and purchase the bearer ' s savings certificates.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of the withdrawal of the bank ' s licence could lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases where bearers of bearer certificates have attempted to recover insurance compensation through a court of law," stated to the AVA.
The problem, of course, is concocted.
After all, no one will pay certificates to buyers, since they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
If it had been that the instrument was not insured at the ASV, then metal accounts would have been banned along with it, in which citizens ' funds were recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts, too, are not covered by deposit insurance, but they have not yet been compromised.
It is likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security document that can actually act as a quasi-denegium.
However, their movement is largely uncontrollable: any bank customer can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before cashing it can be replaced by many owners.
It is not by accident that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must be the specific security that must be kept in the depositary.
And in order to sweeten the pill, banks are allowed to issue such certificates without early repayment.
That is, an analogy is being introduced for the irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyporta and Cardiff
The weekend saw protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the middle of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff Town Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairklow followed up for us during the weekend and talked to protesters who came from everywhere, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter the terrorist group "Islamic State", reporting on 31 August ITAAR-TASS, citing the decision taken at the meeting of representatives of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It is reported that Germany will send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles, to Iraq.
The deliveries will take place before the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to provide an additional 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On 1 September, Mrs Merkel will make a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the shipment of weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the "Islamic State", while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia beat up a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
Donetsk militia hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this occurred in the Gulf of Taganrog near the settlements of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets report the shooting of two Coast Guard boats.
It is clarified that the incident occurred today around 4:20 ms.
The teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains.
TWO of the young buggers were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went camping shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govets Lip in Blackheet.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they had not returned home.
A search team consisting of local police and a rescue team was sent, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Brydal Vale Fall.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up on a winch Monday morning.
They were taken by an ambulance in a stable state to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met.
The Minsk summit talks did not resolve the problems for which they had been convened but created a new format: the first European Union personalities met with the first faces of the future of Eurasians.
Even if it is a matter of concern (the situation around Ukraine cannot be postponed), for the first time EU and Customs Union leaders have discussed a number of "hot issues".
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is not clear; it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this matter were dismissed on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians, and other Europeans followed them, saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader set an example of refined courtesy, which was the behavior of the man who just ripped off the jackpot - and planned a worthy old age in the highest society.
How Maydan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU Ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf, is not just the legitimization of the President with 20 years ' experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European policy and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Research, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Katherine Ashton met his aunt-a-tet with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to defrost," he said, "Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough by Belarusian authorities began well before Maydan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogue on modernization - listed the interviewer Fire, - and international security talks have been held with the US.
The States even lifted a few sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership only encouraged the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in Donbass with the utmost seriousness, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk has neither withdrawn from the Customs Union nor from CSTO, and there is a Russian airbase in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk ' s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, the Belarusian experts are sure.
The success of the Lukashenko movement towards political diversification will be seen in how often Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings in the near future.
At the Press Service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond quickly to questions about what Brussels expected from the relationship in a new format.
Press secretary Ashton Maya Kosyančić simply stated that, while war and peace issues were being addressed, the topic was not a priority.
At the same time, it was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian issue, with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
A drop of degta for Minsk was the statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties were not opposed to Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings, both in Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high-level representatives of the European Commission.
This means that Europe's "last dictator" is gaining the status of a very handshake European leader who is helping to solve a global problem.
European farmer's best friend
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the Euro-commissions on trade and energy, led to the conclusion that the main thrust of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbas, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting ' s timetable for future negotiations on gas supply and for overcoming the concerns of TC countries under the Ukraine-EU association agreement seems to be more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates and numbers.
The Trade Commissioner, Carl De Gucht, nevertheless, pointed out that the EU representatives "have come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not vice versa".
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine is working for Belarus.
Its consequences - and especially the reciprocal sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited space for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mieses Research Centre, former candidate for President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the capacity of Belarus to supply agricultural products in the Russian Federation to circumvent sanctions.
In doing so, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit was buzzing Minsk.
"These schemes are initiated by Russian companies rather than by Belarusian businessmen," he pointed out.
They have worked on long-term supply chains, including from Poland, Germany and Lithuania, and these schemes are now destroyed.
Russia's business is in dire need of something to restore it, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are willing to start production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very much needed."
In the view of Romanchuk, the role of host of the EU and TC negotiating platform is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, and the European Commission had now offered only Euro125 million in compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian president can ask Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for Euro-farmers.
This could raise the profile of Lukashenko in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format is being removed, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new format was indeed Kiev.
"It was your offer to meet, without any delay, to discuss, not from the bay, to decide, after the signing of the EU Association Treaty, to understand the situation that was then developing in Ukraine," he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, and it was rumored that it was initially opposed to the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it has been carefully emphasized that Belarus, in organizing the EU-TC interaction on its land, has no selfish goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that in other areas, particularly in the field of security, promote and promote the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said the "Fire" in the Ministry of Belarus, an agency where words have been carefully chosen recently.
In Moscow there may be zones with toll-free entry
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of toll-free zones as a method of controlling congestion of central roads similar to other major cities in the world and transmits M24.ru with reference to Moscow's transport deputy Maxim Lixutov.
One of the options that has proved successful is access on a fee-based basis.
It's an expert opinion, and we're going to study it, and we're going to look at all the downsides and downsides.
Talking about making some decisions about this before it's too early, Lixutov told me.
The Deputy Mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which were similar in structure and workload to Moscow, was very important to the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the construction already under way of a central ring road, adding Lixuts.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that all traffic does not have to pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient bypass infrastructure, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow," noted the mayor.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of toll-free parking facilities had considerably unloaded the streets in the capital.
He said that the capital authorities were not planning to stop at what had been achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the laying ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
The Bore of Sinful
Frank Miller's and Robert Rodríguez's film "City of Sins 2: A Woman worth killing for" did not have the kind of revolution he could have expected.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), with the minimal but symbolic involvement of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comic books and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain of modern thinking, "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (in the sense of the universe noire theory and under the antithesis - comic space).
From now on, it should read "thesis is antithesis is chaos".
The "City of Sins 2" is chaotic at both the dramatic and philosophical levels: it is both chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yeah, some of the heroes are familiar with the first city, although, look, the big Marv, I remember, ended up in an electric chair, and there's nothing left to take out -- as a popular friend -- from the air of knives and other fucking axes.
But old people are literally being snatched with their elbows like they're breaking into town from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry.
Thus, a story shamelessly torn by authors in the most interesting place, with super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
My own is at the frigid, horny Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vindictive to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But the confusion that Dwight has in her face, let's say, is not unlike Johnny, especially since faces, like other parts of her body, are being taken down with unbroken regularity, is not bad, not even half a win.
They're not human beings, we know they're noir archetypes: a rocky bitch, too confident a player who's met the honey trap of sex, a detective, a corrupt senator.
Well, when an archetype waltzs with an archetype and an archetype chases, it's not a movie, but it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this sublime world, there's something permanent.
The fighting whores from the first city are still holding circular defenses from the shadows of their home slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost is gone, and he's gonna stop by the light, and it's always nice to see Bruce Willis.
The main problem with "City of Sins 2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at putting together the comic book and the noir as a painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to put comic books on the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressive opposites of reality.
The modern-style comic book was born in the late 1920s, at the same time that Dashil Hammet's novels "Blood harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the noir canon, then called "hard-boiled school", "cool school".
Or a pulp fiction.
The comic books have given Hollywood many dozens of heroes, from the sailor Popai, the Spinach eater who gives him the rich power, Superman, Batman and Detective Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Torah, Spider-Man and the others.
But in any movie, there was something wrong with the comic books: the painted characters were reluctant to grow the screen flesh, remained pretenders in the "real" world around them.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existentiality."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of the world's literature.
After world wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, personalities, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What Foresites, what Tibo and Rugon-Mackars, what even Bolkon and Rostov thoughts after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a romance was peacefully mutated into soap opera format, and criminal - by definition marginal - romance was elevated to philosophical prose.
Hammet found out on his skin what it's like to be a nurse on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the association and genre pillars like Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lowsy, Edward Dmitrick.
So the noir whose archetype they asked for is first, rude and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost American socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural but organically linked the comic book to the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive, not shy of its graphic nature, but rather pretending to be a "real" movie.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the Cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered the monstrous sadist son, was worthy of Hammet's pen.
And the scenic details, like cut heads, that the sadist decorated his nest, the feather of the genius James Elleroy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best - that is, the declarative nausea - the neonar representative.
"City of Sin 2" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodrigues' radical style before the comic book tradition.
It must have happened in a lot of ways because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins," you feel like you're trapped in a glass ball where the snow falls asleep in a toy cloaku.
Most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood splashes, but what's the big difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about sociality.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl on a curved path, or, say, tell her distraught parents that her ruiner is punished.
But when there is no sin in the city except sin, there is no sin but the norm.
Bored as any norm.
Chaos "City of Sins 2" is just bored.
For the sake of justice, a domestic rental gave this fine sin a small but pepper.
Titres warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In the most vegetarian episode, when a man is pinched with his fingers, it's a hell of a joke.
Hammet would love it.
The French socialists must "shut up and get France in order," says Frasois Holland's key ally.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to "show a warm attitude" towards the attacked Socialist President whose reshufflings were not approved by the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, with applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite proposals fuelling the conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobier, Minister of Justice, put the sticks in the wheel, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lost faith in the future".
Marín Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wall government would last longer than a few months.
François Holland is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to gather a new government when the old summer did not last.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen's reporters.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
The ruling French party was defeated in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal survey of Du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perryno, a political scientist at Cyance Poe University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel fast that something's changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without Drugs" was left without a lawsuit.
The Sverdlov Court of Arbitration dismissed the action of the Directorate of Administration of the Regional Ministry of Public Administration against the "City without Drugs" Foundation.
The Office intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of Sverdlovsk Region has left pending the action of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (MIGISO) against the "City without Drugs" Foundation (co-founder, Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Royzman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent for the building.
Today, it became known that the plaintiff had not appeared in court twice, which had led to the decision not to proceed.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the MUGISO directorate was not explained, and Maxim Titov, head of the legal department, did not answer the phone.
It was also not possible to contact the representatives of the fund.
This is, again, a mansion that occupied a foundation in the centre of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by the former Governor, Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Managing Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of Sverdlov Region filed an action with the Sverdlov Arbitration Court for the eviction of the foundation from the building.
According to the claim, the agency requested the court to declare the unconstructed free-of-charge contract to be the premises of the memorial mansion.
According to the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim and then appealed to the 17th arbitral tribunal, Permi, which was granted.
The Foundation then filed a cassation appeal against the decision with the same court, which was rejected, after which the decision was appealed by the Foundation to the High Court of Arbitration, but the Court accepted the Director ' s motion.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded under which the foundation began to pay rent again, as reported by the head of the city of Evgeny Royzman.
Rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration of the region has donated this building to us, in recognition of our merit in the fight against drugs, as a token of respect for the foundation.
The current administration had decided differently," he said.

Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, a deputy of Yekaterinburg's pride unicorns Alexander Kossantsov invited the mayor of the city, the Speaker of Eugenia Royzman, to resign.
The reason for this was the criminal case against the person arrested on suspicion of the murder of a retired deputy of the pride of Oleg Kinev, who is considered to be an associate of the mayor.
How did Eugenia Royzman get a criminal case?
On 1 July, it was reported that criminal proceedings had been initiated against the "slurpedo" (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenia Royzmann.
This was reported to the Department of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlov Region, where Anna Filatova, Director General of the Legal Centre for Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of having been involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband in her blog.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "it is yet another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will be turned into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is supposed to present his new designs, there are more leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to American media sources, the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of the joint Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code's dedicated Internet resource, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express on 9 September, making the mobile wallet function available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This function allows payment to be made on the store's register using a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be performed by the user using his thumbprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the first NFC (near Field Communication) technology will be introduced in the iPhone, which allows for non-interactional payment by means of a smartphone and a suitable counter-reader.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Symiconducors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of the collaboration of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconducors and more than a hundred other companies that joined the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with a NFC function, Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link their bank cards to their Google account and pay with an Android smartphone.
American experts stress, however, that despite major investments by high-tech companies in the advancement of NFC technology, American RTs are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on their stores' equipment with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple ' s entry into this market will still make the rangers speed up and accelerate the deployment of this technology in their outlets.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France: Paris' position on the supply to Russia of "Mistralles" does not change
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, Roman Nadal, declared Paris's position on the supply of Mistral-type helicopters to Russia.
"I recall the statement of the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a decision by Europeans, not France," quoted by Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy office replied to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris in the execution of the contract.
For more details on the supply of helicopters to Russia, read the magazine "Ogonek" "Mistral" almost ours."
National Security Council of Ukraine: seven soldiers died in the area of force operations in the past 24 hours
A representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 25 injured in the war zone in the east of the country in the past 24 hours.
The situation under Ilowaysk is extremely complex.
Until the withdrawal operation is completed, the details will not be disclosed.
At the end of the operation, the losses and causes of the situation will be disclosed.
The perpetrators of such a situation would be held responsible," Mr. Liesenko added, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Ilowai, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of SNBO, "every effort is being made to return the captured soldiers", ITAR-TASS reports.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had moved away from Luhansk airport towards the settlement of Georgievka.
Read more about the situation in eastern Ukraine in the "Arsen Awakov" material: the first Ukrainian military came out of the environment under Ilowaysk.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to purchase a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, with access to Lux-class cruise ships and prestige Cruises-rich clients, as it competes with the larger rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, and sources announced on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources have asked to remain unnamed because the negotiations are not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, runs 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from middle-class growth in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
The race companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with the U.S. regulatory authorities for the first public share in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
==History==The Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and a casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned 28 per cent, Apollo owned 20 per cent, and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP, owned 8 per cent of the company's share, according to the accounts as of the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise traffic in North America, according to the registration documents for the first public distribution of Prestige Cruises shares.
Crimea Television Company can receive 250 million rubles of subsidy
At the Ministry of Communications, Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the State television and radio company Crimea in 2014.
According to the draft decree of the Ministry of Communications, which has been placed on a single reporting portal on the preparation of regulations, grants are to be used "to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea".
The money will also be used for the purchase of equipment, roof repairs and power supply systems in the television and radio company building established in 1959, reporting to RIA News.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement activists disrupt the Chinese representative ' s statement the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of Hong Kong ' s leader in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of a majority of the members of the nomination committee, who would probably be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and forced the democratic movement to promise again to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing ' s publication of a document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and held a sit-in.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Jang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
The student activists announced that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to add 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to join South Wifliy's land is related to the desire to pay back the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Minister announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikata, world public opinion should hold Israel accountable for "the continuing settlement activity on the West Bank of Jordan and East Jerusalem".
Putin demands that Kiev begin negotiations on "Stateship" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "State" of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as being equal to the obvious strategy that he has followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and to force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence to get closer to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with State First Television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which was seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the seized territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to pre-revolutionary days of Russian glory.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October, and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the "film of illusions" reported ITAR-TASS.
"We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were in the context of the broader autonomy that had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The intervention of the Kremlin Press Secretary to correct Putin's "misinterpretation" highlighted the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist rebellion in the east in a different way than the open capture of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially by transferring to the Kremlin de facto control of territory that would connect Russia ' s main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, attached five months ago, has the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between Russia ' s Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh constitutional amendments that would give separate regions greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin ' s latest appeal to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed new rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the town of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This entailed extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko addressed the European Union Leaders' Assembly in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military personnel and hundreds of foreign tanks are now inside Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 military personnel had entered the Donetsk region last week to support the troubled separatists, Colonel Andry Liesenko, and the Press Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine reported to reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airlifters captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, who reported to Lysenko on Sunday.
A scandal with naked photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who might have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of frank photographs of naked Jennifer Lawrence hit the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker in charge of this has about 60 candid photographs of the star "Hungry Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, singer Rihann, Ariane Grande and Lia Michel, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski, and living in Melbourne, Greco, also allegedly stolen photos from an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's awful that personal information could be stolen and sent to other people.
Greeka, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "disguised" and that those targeted "remember that they were invaded".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her lying near a pool with her breast naked.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the movie "Chuck" Strakhowski and the actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is an overwhelming invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker by tweeting: "The photos stolen from the mobile phone are in fact no different from the sale of stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, you can't stand the publication of stolen photos.
There's a potential way to steal pictures of naked celebrities.
Mass hacking of star accounts may have been done through vulnerability in the Find My Phone application.
A potential scenario described the Next Web resource.
A Python script was published on Github, which enabled the search of passwords for the Apple's "Find My Phone" service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
The same line of logic and Apple ID password is used for access to the Apple iCloud cloud from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the Find My Phone password to be cross-checked.
The method consistently introduces all kinds of symbol combinations, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The writer of the script claimed that the number of passwords entered was unlimited in the Find My Phone service.
If the security system is correctly organized after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account must be blocked and inform the user of the attempted break-in.
Because of their vulnerability, users did not receive any reports of an attempt to find a password for their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter account, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, Saturday, and a script program was written to match passwords.
At present, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hakkapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the "star" account.
It wasn't me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister's foreign notes appeared again.
Although there is no firm evidence that vulnerability was used to steal photos at the Find My Phone, there was previously a wave of harmful acts using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple claimed to the media that the cloud safety had not been compromised, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
Russian Twitter from Russian Prime Minister Dmitrymedev was also previously hacked into Russia.
If the perpetrators had access to the iCloud described above, the password to the government head account in the microblogging service could be stored there.
The Next Web resource was unable to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability at the End My Phone.
Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian Five-Bill.
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Buryak.
The decree was published on the Internet legal information portal.
Earlier this year, an athlete moved to Russia to live permanently and asked the Federation of Modern Five to give her the opportunity to speak for the Russian Federation.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championships in her personal championship, and became the World Champion in a mixed relay race, which is one of the new kinds of program in this sport.
It also holds the lead in the current season.
According to the rules, in order to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chesswoman Yekaterina Lagno, a Lviv native who is a double European champion (2005, 2008), a blitz world (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women ' s team, she won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the Astana World Team Championship (2013) and the European Team Championships in Warsaw (2013).
The SCR stopped investigating the To 204 accident in Vnukovo.
The Russian Investigation Committee (SRC) has discontinued the criminal investigation into the crash of the T-204 aircraft Red Wings.
This is reported by the Department's press service.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the aircraft engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the crash resulted from the increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to comply with standard boarding procedures, and the unintended release of engines to the higher speed of direct propulsion.
The To 204 aircraft of Red Wings, which was flying from Prague to Moscow, crashed on 29 December 2012 at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft rolled out behind the runway and caught fire.
An aircraft commander, a second pilot and a pilot were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three other flight attendants who were hospitalized with serious injuries were given long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the vehicle travelling on the Kiev highway at the time of the crash sustained serious injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
In the aftermath of the crash, the Transport Prosecutor ' s Office conducted an inspection at Red Wings, during which numerous irregularities were identified.
In February 2013, the airline ' s licence was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelianenko started training at SIZO.
A well-known Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Yemelianenko, aged 33, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault against a housekeeper, recovered completely from his injuries and began training.
The Championship reports it.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexandre Yemelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and detained in Tambowa on 9 May following a car accident that caused him to break his hip.
Emeljanenko, Jr., was arrested until 31 August, and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the trial was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If proven guilty, the athlete would face imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
In January of this year, Emelianenko lost his last fight to a technical knockout of his compatriot, Dmitri Sosnovsky.
Alexander is the younger brother of Fedor Yemelianenko, the more famous fighter.
The latter is the world's four-time mixed martial arts champion, the world's four-time champion, and Russia's seven-time battle sambo champion.
Anger proved to be the most universal and functional human emotion.
The angry expression of a person is biologically universal for mankind, and every organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not random, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, learned by scientists from Australia and the United States.
They reported on their findings in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of faces - moved and down the eyebrows, drawn lips into the thin line, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and even blind children who have never seen it are making it, as noted by Aaron Sell, the lead author of the study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have learned that this emotion has emerged to effectively manage disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he can dictate his conditions, and he communicates it with anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of their own hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and to resort to manual use, feel free to impose conditions upon others that do not benefit them, and prefer to use force to resolve conflicts peacefully.
In response to the fact that anger is first and foremost an "emotion of trade", scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups, which create an angry face, should present the angry individual with a stronger and more dangerous face - and thus force him/her to accept his/her terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer the faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or missing and showed them to informers.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the forward chin alone did not make the face angry, the more physically powerful person in the study was unanimously recognized.
The anger of man, like that of animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated act of self - strength that compels consent and submission.
A man blows up nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog who blows up, or a grandmother who shows his fangs.
"The anger "begins" the respondent's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that shows the opposite side as effectively as possible the consequences of the refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, all of them expressing the same thing," noted Anthropologist John Toubi.
The Ministry of Communications has proposed 250 million rubles for the Crimea television and radio company.
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the Autonomous Non-Profit Organization Crimea Teleradio.
This is referred to in the draft Government Regulation prepared by the agency, which was reviewed by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, grants from the federal budget will be allocated "to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment".
In particular, it is intended to convert the hardware and studio unit, the video walls, the central hardware and the video server with the money allocated.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre optic line (WALC) and the repair of the energy system from the funds allocated.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget allocated to the Ministry of Communications.
The State Broadcasting Company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the area of the peninsula has been reached by television broadcasting.
In 2011, the Crimea Teleradio Company was licensed to broadcast digital television.
