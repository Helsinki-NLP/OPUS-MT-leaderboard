White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4-mat!
White: rooks on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites put the rival in the position of zugwanga on a6, then blacks have only two options: to take a6 or to move the elephant to any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the pawn from b6 to b7 and set the mat. In the second case, the white rook takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
