Obama's Republican Resistance Strategy
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, Brennan Centre considers the last myth to be, claiming that there are fewer cases of electoral fraud in the United States than death by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained new proportions after the November 2010 elections, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photographed identity card and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the voter on the day of the expression of the will and deprive citizens with criminal record of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no United States state had required voters to produce a photographed identity card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities have rushed to extend this practice to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated draft legislation requiring voters to present photo identification cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, United States citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, the 21 million people who have reached voting age, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government authority.
In addition, five million new voters had no such document in 2012.
The cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required identification card with a photograph.
But that's not all.
Voter students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo identity card issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state had requested proof of American citizenship for voting.
The first such requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American voters.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to register some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republic ' s legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened to Latin American people.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
In contrast to the whites, who accounted for 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent were early voters.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been hamstrung by democrat governors.
The most controversial laws had been suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has made it possible to limit in part the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identity card.
However, the new rules, which had come into effect, would certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from the Democrats condemn the bias of laws that have been passed, with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan Center ' s 2011 report shows that states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces wrong results, false negatives, and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, who are so reluctant to go to the clinic, have more to doubt.
Do you want to take a test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates for patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis is 30-40 per cent higher for those who did not pass the screening.
So I would recommend a test from the age of 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and moist.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which is not a long-term risk, but rather a choice for active surveillance.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we are defining the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend a test after all.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether this test is necessary or not.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess everything for and against a PSA test.

Prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle receptor to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were to eat well and move enough, 30% of cancers could have been prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%," says Andre Bolier, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says the press secretary, Andre Bolier.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after the rejection of smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Study shows that regular physical activity for life protects against colon cancer," the Association adds.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too many ways, it increases the risk of fat intestinal cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preservative of meat by smoke, drying or salinization may result in carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But for the time being, the results of these studies are not clear.
In SCC ' s view, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
While one showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
There is also a lack of clarity in the assessment of the impact on vitamin D cancer.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"Trying doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs' boson is in detail.
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to locate Higgs' boson caused a real shock - and not without cause.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is the last particle that was predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, at least, the "least imperfect" description of nature and the behaviour of matter - but which could not have been detected in an experimental way before.
But physicists aren't quite sure it's the Higgs boson yet.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's just say we're talking about the Higgs boson, because the odds of making a mistake seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is entirely inevitable, saying that two things can't be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way around this rule, not even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the principle of Paulie's exclusion, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment in time if they are in the same "quantum state" - the "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called farmmen who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, bosons, a vile band of anarchists, who have no respect for anything — at least this principle — may find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Berkeley's Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: mesons we're not going to talk about here, and power particles, which are the main forces of nature, and to which the Higgs boson is in some ways.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all exotic beings as one might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of light", which is the "courier" of electromagnetic power.
Indeed, when a single particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular location, about as a stone thrown into the pond.
This "offence" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.) and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore one of the "force transmitters" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must have been violated.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to stimulate it, it is necessary to achieve very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could shake only a very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operates at CERN, the Great Hadron Collider, which is a 27 km diameter ring, to achieve such enormous energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never hold on to the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have mass, while others (as a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what could "can bring" all these researches ask Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (MP), and they also allow physicists to detect a discrepancy between observations and MM projections.
In addition, some of them are eager to see such a discrepancy discovered, so that the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, without offering any explanation for gravity (y!) or for dark matter that forms about 80 percent of the universe (ooh!).
But so far, no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that they do not exist.
See, early in the 1960s, pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs couldn't even imagine what revolution their work would cause.
They predicted their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist, Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself designed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was initially viewed as more of a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the tools that accompany the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world and deserves the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
That certainly doesn't mean that Big Adron Collider's work is gonna change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die... ♪ The debt ♪
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume soon, while a bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Dolg" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. also lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year respite.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven years," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Palliative Care Home of Victor Gadbois in Beloia, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom and even feeding yourself.
As he sits at a table with a delicious meal, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's awake, even smiling, talking to strangers who work around him, bringing him medicine, taking him to the bathtub.
Manhood before a common death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"In the course of our lives, we are taught that a man must pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbois shelter.
Regressing to the condition of a child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
"It all depends on a person's ability to accept a decline," he claims.
Because, in the eyes of many people involved in palliative care, important events occur at the height of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbois palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Projections give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides assistance called "medical care".
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid of dying of suffocation.
But the disease allowed me to recognize my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, "before she lets me put a breath-friendly mask on her.
She is still waiting for her son ' s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
Victor Gadbois shelter provides body care and nutritional support through a group of volunteers.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
That's not enough, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
Life goes on here in the best possible conditions, Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
If he dies, we'll agree to give him a brandy or pepsi strip, as he asks.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son finished that beer in the legs of the deceased this morning.
"We help our loved ones as well as our patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of nursing.
Victor Gadbois shelter doesn't look like the last day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during his toast, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children, who tried everything to survive, died in a tragic way.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
Fifty-three per cent of patients admitted to the Victor Gadbois shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbois Shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this huge gap in Quebec ' s health system that has led many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and suicide assistance.
Since October, there has been a manifesto signed by the palliative care lights, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, which indicate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently," she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R., in terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid the only reason patients want to die is because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Elena Richard's hopes for survival were minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I stopped fighting, she said.
But she told me that my days were numbered!
There's no such thing as an all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel thinks 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are grateful to the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team alleviates their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative siting, where the patient sleeps until his death, from time to time, or at all times.
We can no longer pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who fail to alleviate their pain will be able to access palliative siting.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean, "I want to get euthanasia," it means, "I want to feel better."
The production of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia specialists each day tell what they know about the huge "system" that encircles the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
Industria, which cost Quebec's taxpayers very much, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's funny how this system breaks down after all the money has been put into it, "is joking about Jacques Ducheno, deputy and former chief of the Montreal Police."
It was he who caused the scandal in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation into official crimes involving road construction contracts in Quebec, for which the then Prime Minister from the liberals, Jean Sharé, had agreed very reluctantly.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, the Ministry of Transport alone would have kept a billion dollars in contracts," if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbono Commission "has already removed the two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "open up the patterns behind the individuals".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, was joined by a large number of Government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, Molot's special unit, which after 2009 forced Montreal's hard-core cartel to stop overestimating the value of the contracts.
A series of searches had been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gilles Wyankur, who recently resigned as Mayor of Lavalle, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, several engineers of the Montreal route service and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkuto and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation of a "system" for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambia had given 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to a Mafia broker who, in turn, had transferred money from Mayor Gerald Tramble's party, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) on the right and left to various parties in the province, mostly liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Overvalue analysis contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked without fail.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for the sewage contracts that he overestimated.
Other road construction officials admitted to raising the bill by 30 to 40 per cent by means of false supplements.
Then, an organizer from the mayor ' s party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party ' s funds with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, bringing Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of Rivier de Prarie County in the east of the island, she's been resisting since 2010 the sale of a five million dollar municipal property resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of the dirty money in the campaign
She said that in the investigation that would eventually be initiated, she would "put on a thread to understand the functioning of ants-infested system to stop gangrene and identify those responsible".
This process is characterized as "diseased but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and an observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean houses.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes, for his part, that "the masters stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but did not participate in the scheme.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec is up to 70%, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but he says that this will not change the situation: "As long as we don't severely restrict the expenditure of the election, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of State contracts and party funding: "We cannot go below; we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If that story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"The PSC is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you've achieved an extraordinary scale at the PSW.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be explained by the new dimension of the PSW.
Great players have arrived.
I'll grow up next to them every day.
Technical staff have also brought much.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the beginning, at the NIF prep center in Clairfontaine, and until I arrived in St. Etienne, I've always been on my way.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
This summer's replenishment is not a new game to play very high-level games.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be on the level and put up to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my positioning.
He's being helped by deputies like Claude Mackele, who was in the same position as me.
Is Anchelotti in charge?
Sure.
Anchelotti is a respect to all technical staff.
He is one of the best coaches in Europe today in the First League.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
That's when I stepped away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSW season?
Lion took the lead from us in League One.
But we're still on standby.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been well qualified in one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything could be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to end up first in our group, in front of Porto, so we can take the game back in one eighth of the finals.
Will PWP become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and establish long-term positions.
That's not true today.
The PWP has the financial means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the First League title like last season is gonna be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship.
We were close to it last season.
In May, it was a disappointment because we had everything we had to do to get to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
In general, 79 points imply the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the PSW?
It's okay to expect a lot of things from us, considering how much we've invested and what kind of players we've got.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win at home 4-0 against Troy and we're still found to criticize, of course, it's a little upsetting.
We wonder what people expect us to do first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 bill.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't made it to the eighth final in two seasons, even though they've spent a lot of money!
Given the amount we've invested, we've presented you with 15 points ahead of us by the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Leon and Marcel, who weren't up last season, were "rejoiced" by this new PSW.
This shows how fascinating the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSC seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's exploits.
So what if they say there's some sort of "Evil Dependence."
This simply means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he has scored many heads.
He came for it, and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a human being and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with France?
How disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from ripping off some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out stronger.
Today, I manage to play a good selection match.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must act exemplaryly.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham headed by the Blues?
They're effective for him.
He's got good positions in the selection team for the World Cup.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he's inspired to win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us as Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the Blues to Brazil.
A good, well-deserved tie (1-1) ripped out in Spain on October 16th is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no matches like this in my career.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Completely opposite to the current exchange of money based on central banks numbered transactions between receiving parties with commissions to process them.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is clearly a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but converted to dollars, euros ...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows files to be exchanged between participants at the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a payment facility.
The Bitcoin exchange rate, which reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in the system in its virtual currency report published in October.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "like normal currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used to promote video games that are earned in the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook's social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Due to the content of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account sent over the entire network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It passes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is a hash phase of a file, that is, converting a big file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be irresistibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user wanted to pay the same money twice (less than ten minutes) for the purpose of deception, only one of the two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoin.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increased computing capacity.
The network's life has already survived ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked and bitcoin was stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Large players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as WordPress, are allowed.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analysed the account book and found that almost 80% of the bitcoin were not in circulation.
Giant Sales were announced in November.
Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged, and Ion Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold, is pleased.
Pierre Nuaza, the other author of this currency allowance, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-reconcile payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The implementation system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just to give an address that can be photographed and recognized by the phone, Pierre Nuaz explains that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to review hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, intends, by the way, to re-examine the various risks that are now considered to be heightened if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future without relying on us alone.
We have suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we viewed as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, wounded and wounded.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former commanders who have fled Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West becomes more sensitive.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills of the almond trees planted with French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, and the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the darkness of these peasants, where they outnumber Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Council war returned to power in 2001.
They have become businesses that capture State land to resell them to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, want a government that isn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have managed to do American generosity will leave: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled by both boys and girls.
Jobs should be provided for these young people, who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and look everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command her will they be considered legitimate?
The old anti-Council commanders are already taking steps to rebuild provincial friendships that are not subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, following the Western pattern, but the United States wanted to make it a centralized State with strong presidential authority, removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But since the 1950s and even earlier, his country had been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry has not been set on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
It only increased the feeling that Western countries were there to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Ainak's copper deposit, leaving international archeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, return to normal relations one day on an equal footing.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls ' lyceum, boys ' , French university faculty, French institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds and perform the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous community work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labour, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest rehabilitation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in the area of arable land.
What will we keep to remember ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, which is very harsh in these valleys, often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural works from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, as the farmers said they wanted, they needed to be given a little non-military support that would be well controlled and direct to them.
The difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Morsi's new risky move.
While Egypt has been divided more than ever on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it emergency powers, it has decided to play a wa-bank.
By surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Egypt had soon been relying on a preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion" by continuing to "breach the word" and "fail the right".
At the camp, his followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brothers to give up their intention to explain to Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview to American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I keep emergency powers", which are supposed to come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, the reserve participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... the time for prayer, as some committee members felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly had been wrong.
The text on which a vote was still under way yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2, ultimately remained identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the Shariah are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace "principles" with "rules" so that they could be applied more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Personality," the liberals say, who only see it as a PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of laws with the Shariah.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, i.e. "people called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next president of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but people with university education, some of them studying in the French system," soothes Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "article 220 may be ambiguous as the terms used in it are taken from religious language.
This applies in particular to "fix".
In the future, the question may arise as to how competent the civilian judges are to decide."
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have fallen significantly compared to those of the old regime.
Another point of contention: the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will take place not in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter had also expressed concern about the text they considered harmful to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been preserved and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speak of the protection of a woman any more, Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch, points out.
According to her, the only positive development was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to be on TV last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State, in turn, will be on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists wait for holy places, Pup Earth and sea from the desert
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the originality of nature.
AIF identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
We should visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all those who enter this "buyer" will be pardoned by God's grace.
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ' wonders: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking along the water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Jesus also appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the most holy place in Jerusalem.
The believers here pass the Sorbi Way or the Jesus Cross Route (in Latin, Via Doloroza).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia Pretorum, where there was judgment, and leads to the temple of the Coffin of the Lord on Mount Golgophe, the Crucifix, the Stone of Absolution, and the place where Jesus was buried in the streets of the Old City.
Here lies the symbolic Christian Pump of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem was built at a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was raised from which a cross was made for Jesus ' crucifixion.
Jerusalem is also the most holy place for Jews, the Wall of Crystal, which remains from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 N.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave wish notes here, which are then fulfilled.
Take a vertical trip.
The ruins of Massada's fortress were left by the secret shelter from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 metres above sea level.
Only those who engage in climbing can reach them.
The rest are brought to this historic summit by a rope road lift.
And in the north of the country, the famous Hermon Ski Resort is located at an altitude of 1600-2040 metres, and in the winter months it is a huge influx of tourists.
He's got a shuttle bus coming to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of skis is 45 km.
In an ancient tradition, the mountains were supposedly filled with pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition contains a wide representation of the paintings of the Impressionist and Expresserists Mone, Piszarro, Renoir, Cesanne, Cislay, Matissa, Modigliani, Chahala, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bang Museum, which consists of several halls of ancient Turkish baths with visitors and bananas of the time.
In Casearia, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
The entrance is free, and donations are categorically rejected.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, describes one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, a children ' s memorial, was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who had been destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in the dark.
Stars are flickering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get better.
Israel ' s three main resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each one has swimming pools, water parks, dolphins, and aquariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea swims even during the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees of heat and the air warms to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is warmer and swims all year round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world at the lowest point on the planet, 417 metres below sea level.
Lazur water in it is salt, easily keeping it afloat, not even able to swim at all.
The landscapes around here are incredibly beautiful.
They come here to receive treatment using salty water — rags and healing mud — and to treat the health of dermatites, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthrites, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus in order to clean up the nerves.
Touch the Secrets of Antiquity
They're kept by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean.
Through it came the famous Maritime Way, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
In tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists are very fond of wandering the narrow streets named after the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street with your own sign, Fortune's gonna be nice.
You can meet newlyweds in Jaffa who come from all over Israel and even from other countries at a photo shoot.
And in Caisaria, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Keisaria was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Visitor for observation
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: around 30 percent of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip in United States dollars (now US$ 1 to US$ 3.8) than in euros.
Urban transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a express tram, and in Haifa is the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations linking the Lower City to Upper City.
In fact, it's an underground funickler.
Travel in all urban transport modes is worth six shekels, which can be transported for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, it is Jewish tradition to celebrate the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are shut down.
And Sunday morning starts working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and meals, which combine milk with meat.
It offers a wide variety of ovine and beef, soup and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste hummus, various sauces, balls made of moth - falalalel, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fat cats that walk on their own.
You can see them sleeping on the rooftops of parked cars tonight.
The murky ones love public places and don't give up their treats.
The rental of the vehicle, depending on the stamp, would cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance, $15 a day.
And a bike rental will cost 15 shekes a day.
Tickets at museums are worth an average of 30 shekels.
Number language
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Travel and recreation were the most frequent among U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, there were 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, 51 per cent more than in 2010, prior to the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will lead to Moscow: migrants raise money in their language.
While deputies and human rights defenders are arguing about the mandatory language testing law, fraudsters are already selling "lip" certificates.
Every year 13 million hastarbatheers come to Moscow, Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left in their homeland.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to pass the Russian language examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing, welfare and retail sectors.
In time, however, the FMC promises that the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
In addition to the language, Russian history and the basis of legislation will have to be passed.
Language skills will have to be confirmed for both obtaining and extending work permits.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the State language.
Nor are people who were able to obtain certificates and diplomas before the break-up of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, sanctification and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Language of Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGU, the SPBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres had already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the deputies of the State Duma and the FMC.
And human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have asked the press many times: What does that actually mean?
What will change the obligation to speak both for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration authorities respond that this will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explained Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federation ' s office in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, an education that does not know the language and does not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I'm sure Sebelev, a future migrant is doomed to run into people who, in the guise of helping him, are going to put a "walk" in a creepy, tight barn where he and dozens of his kind will be eating for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and upon arrival they are lied to, taken away passports, not paid the promised salary," confirmed by the head of the Directorate-General for Labour Migration of the International Labour Organization of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear, you nasty man!
However, as long as many citizens of Central Asian republics who are going to work in Russia admit not only that they do not know the language of the country they seek, but that they also write hard on their own.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a meaningful primary education.
Because their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress them properly, put them on, and dress them up for school.
As they grow up to be teenagers, they go to work as soon as possible.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders have noted one important point.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the Gastarbatheers still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or outside entrance forbidden."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is because of bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs between 12,000 and 16,000 rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only 1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"Please a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Khushkadamov.
"Fly, don't be cheap, buy the painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that it was not only migrant registration documents that were false.
Several "lip" certificates for language tests have already been withdrawn by FMC staff.
Fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they were given to the new owners for good reason: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests paid 7,000 rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of a formal test procedure: it will cost 3,000 to a migrant worker.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that "scars" cannot be bought simply, both the authorities and human rights defenders come together.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise the Gastarbatheres, who have failed to pass the first test, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take over the illegal arms market
The percentage of crimes with legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to strengthen the law on the possession of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: press shots at weddings without casualties and a massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age from 18 to 21 for a weapons licence.
The idea was endorsed by the head of the Dominan Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovay, and promised that amendments to the weapons law would be made to the State in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by turning hake.
There was an open letter on the web, written by representatives of various public organizations with firearms, demanding that no "intellectual tightening" should be allowed to take place.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, reported to the Russian BBC service by forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, in the six months of 2012, 142 offences involving the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs agencies were committed, compared with 1,168 thousand in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not place the perpetrator in the black market.
Now, according to them, all weapons can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being expanded through several channels.
The main channels are five, according to the retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and Genstabe.
Screen shot of a website taking orders for weapons
The first is the "armey or military footprint", that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says the Baran.
The next kind of black weapon is stolen by criminals from members of the security forces.
The Baranian explains that these include the stolen police warehouses and the stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal guns are being sold out of military warehouses.
Many military depots have been bombarded.
"There's a proven theory that some of the arsons were made specifically to cover up the loss," says the ex-military.
According to Baranza, arms manufacturers are contributing.
"Private arms factories are now being produced that fail to compete in the international market and throw weapons out of the floor into the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially are pistols and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's a production, sometimes artisanal, and there's a mafia that's organized the flow," ex-military explains.
Where did the weapon come from?
Experts considered the approximate share of each source of illicit arms transfers to the black market.
This was reported in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
The experts analysed the accounts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminological literature and the open data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, coming from the army and the security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there "by the officials whose work is related to weapons", the report states.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent are stolen at the stage of weapons production, and 5 per cent come from "black archaeology".
The consultant seller of one of the arms stores who asked not to give his name said that the weapons found by the black cops had long been unpurchased - too old.
Most often, as he says, the salesmen follow the new party to the military warehouse.
A man buys a unit, like a TT gun, through the master.
He's being discharged, passed over the fence.
"He's moving her to town and here he sells 900 euros a grand with two stores," he says.
"True, the police are aware of all the cases, so sometimes when the crime detection plan is on fire, they make a check purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store."
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, until a comrade came along and offered to come to the Godmother platform, where there'll be a man who'll take me to the corner, where we'll negotiate.
That's where I found out the price of the gun.
Military observer Victor Baranets
To get the gun, I need someone I know who has a way out, says the consultant salesman.
There are salesmen in the markets, but there's also a conditional "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of casttes through a man I'm sure of right now.
He only supplies them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given an album with a picture of "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Barantz, isn't offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I'm not just buying a potential client. We're going to the woods with the salesman. We're setting a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I make sure the weapon hits well, we start trading," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Internet searchers send them to websites and groups at VKontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
It doesn't require any papers or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in an advertising hat on the website "Bring a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will the minors be sold?
"Without a license, of course," says user Ivan (orphography retained).
"Cup of TT. Moscow" is a concise request from the Fedorrenks.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a vast network of front sites that want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People walk like a hungry fish for food, and then they get coal in Siberia.

I've heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the limits of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
"The answer is to send a photograph and instruction where the weapon is hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, the spokesperson of the public organization Right to Weapons.
Victor Baranets claims that by leaving an application on the site, you can be left unarmed and imprisoned.

A 100-dollar Makarov.
Experts estimate that between $100 and $900 could be spent on the purchase of illegal small arms.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Weapons, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It'll take a month and a half to wait.
It is shipped from the warehouses of long-term storage by the middle-level management of these warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the agency, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through McDonald's office.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low salaries in Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Fried Chiken.
As long as no one predicts whether this wave will turn into a ninth waltz, or whether it is destined to breathe early.
The stock is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries paid to private Walmart workers and fast food systems, the objective of the protesters is to establish trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy has barely been covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by a cheap sale orgy that captured millions of commoners and sometimes accompanied by a scuffle.
On that day, some Walmart employees, employing 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and pickedeted together with trade unions and left-wing members of the company's stores, whose goods were counted as modest and medium-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-paid Walmart workers only work at work.
Accessibility and product availability have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheap goods, partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of autolifters or hand scanners.
Shareholders on Black Friday demanded salary increases and complained that the cost of the medical insurance provided by the Corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who gets $9.5 an hour, that expense is beyond his means, they say.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on her salary right now.
If Walmart's entire salary increases were to be transferred to the buyers' shoulders, each shop visit would cost them only 46 cents more.
They'll spend $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart's supporters have noted that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in her stores from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers have made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview with Huffington Post, that the jobs had been abandoned by a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a "piarovian trick" by the union organizing her.
"Free Cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart's department stores (they are not welcome in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but by McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of meals, and then he doesn't even give you sick leave and pay you to do honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
The fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average their private workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
Nobody makes less money than them in this expensive town.
How can you exist in New York with that kind of money, it's incredible to me.
Back in the day, the McDonalds had nearly a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I'm constantly facing interviews with McDonald's employees who complain they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum contains a comment that notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protesters, who began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonalds on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the field of rapid nutrition.
American law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with molestations and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult for the trade union to reach fast food for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of human resources.
Dissenting
Noise protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The campaign culminated in a mid-day rally near Times Square, where several local democrat politicians spoke, in particular a member of the council, Jumeyn Williams, who said, "Macdonalds says he sells billions of meals, and then he doesn't even give you sick leave and pay you to do honest work!"
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York democrats, such as Bill De Blasio, the mayor's candidate, who stated that "we must work together to support fast-food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As New York Times described it, it was the largest of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, and not all of them were fast food workers, employing tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate the flames of mass movement.
"As long as you cheat your brain, it's medium."
The popular theme of advanced reality among fans has recently been perceived mainly through the lens of special points.
First in the summer, at its annual conference, the model was shown by Google, and then in November, it became known that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
However, the conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory shows that for scientists in the company, the glasses are over.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you give me an outline of what your research team is doing?
- We're working on human interaction with machines, but we're trying to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind is trapped in the mass phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes sticking a finger in them.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is for sale, because everyone is interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
Despite the fact that Kinect has been physically affected, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not very good yet.
We're trying to change that, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design.
We need to let the computer world out into our physical world, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea. It's a matter of privacy because you don't always want to tell people about your actions and intentions.
All kinds of interaction with computers are actually good, but everyone's in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about splashy ones, but about such cheap, short ones.
The gestures were not taken by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a hand-held clock.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, like a gesture plus a voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how would you ask me to give you this soda can?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's mutual.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that can better measure human responses.
It could be laser sensors, for example, they give a pretty good depth resolution, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your problem with modern cameras?
Is there a resolution, a depth or something?
- In principle, the present generation is something we can build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get megapixels 8 at 1,000 k/s.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X and Y axis resolution, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 km/s is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes of our Radmond lab made a touch sensor with a controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects human and machine interaction.
I could really use the equivalent of a device like this in my job, but I don't have to touch it so I can get a bigger shot in a second.
- Shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- There are three cameras in Kinect now, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is the receiver of a reflected signal.
And now the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the amount of calculation required.
It would be nice to create a flexible version of Kinect, play with the curved location of the cameras, and see how that would help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of the day-to-day use of the technology of the increased reality of glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to walk around with a smartphone in your hands up, but I think the coolest option would be a "rolling" added reality, where you could switch from glasses to smartphones, projection displays, and so forth.
Glasses are a very personal device, that's their strength (you see private things only), and at the same time weakness - an added reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your team's answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that enhanced reality is the seventh breakthrough in human and machine interaction.
I think the eighth might well be a little more tactile.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of image substrate.
She's very good at recording presses!
But there are technologies that are really designed to make these "cards in the air" tangible -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located -- that make sense, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like you've been pillowed on a pillow.
There are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Did you try to fool your brain?
Make him think he feels something he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There is another challenge ahead of us, which is how to make a person physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking on an open, almost endless - working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as it's medium-sized, it's a lot of work for years.
That's what makes working on a virtual reality so attractive to a researcher -- a lot of things in a completely incipient state.
Taste instead of culture, Rosballt.
Rosballt is continuing the St. Petersburg Vanguard project on the townsmen who are ahead in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already included prominent artists from the St. Petersburg stage, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, without being universally known.
The new hero of Rossballa is a handsome artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who meets at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at fancy parties, and backseats.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather a crowd of viewers wherever they appear.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely peterburg socio-philosophic fairy tales, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a bright man in the Peterburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city who, by showing up on the streets, is smiling at the people of the city, cheering up the mood.
Recently, he took up the scarf and became a Peterburg charmer because he was ripe for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around town all red, not yellow or turquoise?
- I've chosen the red color as a fashion designer for the view and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker, and a society.
Although everything in society is a little gray, it's an aggression and an incitement.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discuss.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the DK Neveski exhibition, where my work was displayed.
I realized it was my way.
Back then, a wave of old unofficial artists passed, and the new, loose ones like me weren't clear.
I became friends with the new wave artists, with the post-gasonics that led to Pushkin's 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, all genre except the word.
And all of this came together in your Art Clinic... it was important for me to be in the center of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied Pushkin 10, and there was a music and art club, a Bohemian club, and the house of the Peterburg Bohemus until there was no renovation.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tequila jazz, I remember Schnura being brought in with the "Uho Van Gogh" project.
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the funner, they were wearing tight tights, among them was Igor Vdovin, now fashionable composer.
When the band played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Haly-Hali times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he got basic education and education.
The D 137 Gallery, the Griboed Club, they're backslides from Art Clinics.
That's where our employees and regulars left.
I'm the hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination of "The Stranger of the Year," I was named, and my culmination ended.
In new times, it's uncomfortable to work under old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in our years, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characterized by recognized manner.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're very relevant and sharp.
I'm gonna have a program show, the Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are an extraordinary category.
I used to be social, being like this right now is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is blurry. Tragic is being removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian change in order of order.
Now they're meeting the dresses with an outer mechanic, not an inner man.
Or maybe he shouldn't give up his hand and spit in his face.
And the fraud will be removed by changing.
And the other day, we saw you as a city charmer.
Who better than me is to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful.
Right now, commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are being disintegrated.
People used to run into packs, the goddess loved one thing, the other thing.
Now everyone's broken into a microcommunity, and now it's hard for everyone to like it.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who's gonna like you.
Every cult hero now has 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand people coming to Stas Mikhaylov!
- He's got throws coming in, and the sex-social sphere works.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and in the end less management, less money, it'll blow.
I've got fans, but I can't fool them, I can't ruin what I've gained.
When I was a young man, I wrote pictures that one collector had them on the wall next to Falc and Larion.
I started with the paintings they usually end up with.
They're often confused these days.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, raised by the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Cyril, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept: an official from a culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
Under the right kings, it wasn't like that, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There's a good consultant in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're pushed, because we need higher experts who will properly appreciate these experts and give them a way.
There's a taste in it now.
The same Erarta, but they're distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What is it to you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, that's wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinness.
We need to make fashionable art like it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with funding from St. Petersburg grant
To be born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceships with Earthlings on board are being sent to search for a backup planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is, how can we continue our generation in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be exploited at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, Senior Fellow of the State Astronomical Institute of P.C. Sternberg (GAIS).
But if conditions on Mars are better suited to life, then on the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The approach to reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, we did experiments on plants.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their Earth varieties.
Then it's infestation, tiny fruity drosophiles.
In 1979, the eggs of quails were sent into space to check how the embryo developed in conditions of weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick out there.
And then there's the problem.
"The problem of this bird having to find a support, it must stand on its legs and move," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of RAN Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding the support, the chicks were curled up indiscriminately.
Ten hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the trouble was, four days later, they were just dead.
"And twice we hatched chicks, and then we refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," notes the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological "miniquech" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the Biosatellite "Bion" will have only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats who were already sent into space with fruit.
They didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was on biosatellites, but again it's a single experiment, and such research needs to be done," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had a progeny.
But it is not yet possible to approach the issue of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, when they lose their normal habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
No such experiments are conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our tea has gone, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive a flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after that flight?
"No one answered that question," says the veteran of the missile and space industry of Wahtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, Valentina Tereshkova's first female astronaut gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitzka, the second female astronaut, had a son who had been in orbit twice and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, there are cosmonauts, and after a long flight, everything's going to go well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital missions," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the Russian hero Valeri Polakov.
Yet mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The PPC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
The cosmonauts work in outer space in a zero-float environment.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If the water is comfortable for adults, but it's a strange environment, then it's a natural element for infants.
The little Ihtiandras seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the baby being in mom's foliage for about nine months, and it's easier for him to get used to water.
In principle, that's logical, because it's only two weeks from birth, from the moment of that first swim.
"It's very little to forget," says Marin Aksenov's breast-swimming instructor.
In short, if a child's weightlessness is more natural, the woman needs gravity, gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, and the ability to push the fruit down.
All right, let's put it down, and that's by relying on birth stimulators.
Of course, in a special cell, you can go to labor, she'll push him out.
"What's next?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling Earth's gravity, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
You can't dress a newborn in orbit like an adult in a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital.
"And this experiment, which you and I are going to do when we allow a child to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled, totally disadapted person," the head of the bioethics committee of IMPRA Ran Igor Pestov.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
After a while, however, this will be a reality when earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief, General Audit Office: The audit of the Schwartz system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, Marioslav Kal, from an interview with Aktualn.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented on Kal's current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of bad practice, Peter Nash time's approach to the so-called Schwartz system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the PDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not disturb business by testing - is this prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions which are required to verify and enforce obligations", Kala notes.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly were we talking about?
It means a parallel test that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation affirms how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then applied in practice as well.
All the information has been collected and, even if it is not completed, interesting differences have been discovered - to put it simply, we may have "accuracy and unmistakable" legislation, but in practice, we have given way to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, and it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How exactly does this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to halt the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not have a positive effect.
The economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're gonna achieve that by reducing the restrictions on our orders.
Perhaps the system will be filled with paperwork so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier to find than if the restriction did not decrease.
You're talking about domestic problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
And how does the control system function in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU, or is this not working?
As far as institutions are concerned, Bundesrechtnungshof, which is based on our principle, also has a panel working in a slightly different way, but basically both institutions operate in the same way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal lands - their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only run federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it easier than we are?
Actually, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some ways Germany can be taken as a model, but it's not exactly the best in everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have benefited from cooperating with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, in some way, are there consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been reflected in our verification work.
As we monitor the facts, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits -- we started using our new tool "detection of the risk of inefficiencies" through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts. We analysed them. Of course, these changes will occur because the restrictions, the terms of some types of tenders, and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law would benefit or add to the burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that might arise was that the rules would become "hard" and they would not be respected.
In previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - the regional council) that any failure to comply with the public procurement law constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened that way?
I don't think that's the way it is.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but should not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
Then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the FOC would not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called Schwartz system.
Is the Schwartz System prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibited anything, the Prime Minister could not stand up to the work of the bodies which were required to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We're gonna change this law and let it happen," but you can't say that we're gonna pretend like nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules, as and what should be formally implemented, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I believe we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly pass.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passable, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovar province
This morning, the roads in the Karlovar region were passable, but some of them are frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it should be slightly warm during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, on the ridges of the Rudd Mountains there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it was reported that the areas were less visible due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be filthy and slippery.
All roads belonging to Class II and Class III, including mountain routes, are also accessible.
However, some of their areas still contain the remnants of frozen snow and the places where the snow is brought in.
We need to be particularly careful on the high roads.
Pardubitz and Kralovegradsk Province
The Czech Highway and Highway Administration reports on its Internet pages that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened with ice, while mountain roads and highland roads may contain a broken layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a holocaust that can be found especially on the high places of the Pardubitz province.
The ice may be near Lanshkrone, Usti nad Orlitz, Polik, Switawi or Visoke Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitawi are treated with chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of Krkonoše and the Orlitz Mountains.
The imported snow layer is located on roads on the highlands in the Rikhnova nad Knegow and Trutnov areas.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today, the cloud is variable without rainfall.
Temperatures usually vary between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzen Province
The roads in the Plzen region are passable this morning, but places need to be careful and adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it may be slippery in some places.
There may be mist among drivers, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 is now almost unrestricted, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and extinct surface.
In southern Plzni and Tahov, it is possible to find filthy areas.
Class II and III roads are wet, and there is also a warning for slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the few roads used in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Province
Drivers heading up to Olomouc Province are now required to take into account snow porridge on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Czerwengoorsk saddle and on the road towards Vidal Krshij.
During the night, the snow forced road workers to enter the street, according to traffic authorities, the snow fell about three centimetres of snow in Schumperka.
In other areas of the edge of the road, it is generally possible to pass without restriction.
"There's snow residue on Schumper's high places.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervengogor saddle," CHAN (Chesh News Agency) reported today to the traffic manager of the Noisy Road Administration.
During the night, their colleagues from Yesenik went to clear the roads, and they believed that the roads on the high places after the chemicals had been processed had remained naked and wet.
There are no restrictions on roads in Olomouc, but drivers in Sternberke must be careful in forest areas where humidity is still present.
Oysterland, Liberetsk Province
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are some difficult places left.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road has been closed off from Telnica on Klinica in the Ustzec province.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there is snow and ice on the roads. In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middleland, there are no problems, mostly dry roads.
Traffic complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the emergence of a holocaust in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the perfect conditions were created for his formation at night, with rain and snow all day long, the sky clears at night and frosts.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highway and on track I/13 on the border between the Ustack and the Liberetsk regions.
Owing to the snowy branches of the trees surrounding the road itself, they were forced to close the Telnica road on Knnica.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to build positive energy.
What do you think about the end of the world coming in less than a month?
It's just one of many disturbing news that we people get so easily caught up in.
Together with The Tap Tap, we're always joking about it and saying that we're the only group in the world that can generate enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We have decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which was announced at 11:10 p.m. on December 21st.
The day before that, on December 20th, at 9 p.m., three concerts were held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will run out, frankly, at a time when the May calendar will be completed on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who thought of that idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all came up with our painter, Gonza Augusta.
In addition to saving enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which this world will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which can be bought at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World is Cancelled".
Will the anthem already loved by YouTube attend these Benefis concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if things work out and the world doesn't end.
He's gonna be sung by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also broadcast live on Czech television at the same time.
He wrote and played the role of Jesus in the Tomas Ganak video, and he also participated in the Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other persons in Czech cultural life, as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to actively connect them to these projects.
Turns out a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the benefit of a concert against the end of the world?
To buy equipment for STUDEO's barrier-free education centre, we've been working this way with Tap's civil association at the Edlicki Institute for the sixth year.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Edlicki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the Edlicki Further Construction Project, a separate building will be created in the future to which we will move with this project.
There will be several musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We've been trying to design a program that's gonna interest all generations, including children.
For example, there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratatose with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jerzy Suhi in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any similar "grandid events" in the future?
In May, we'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and then of course, we'll have an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd be happy to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
You've got serious plans abroad, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
However, so far we've had no problem with this, Czech airlines and British Airlines have always been perfectly prepared for us, and I've been surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you been up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do in Russia, we have seen that in the east we are still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and here still there is the autonomous movement of a man on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there's no such thing as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people ' s attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
On the contrary, what must we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
It's normal in London and Madrid that people with severe disabilities move on their own in the streets, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, so we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barbarity is one thing, but at a time when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, everything will really start to change.
As long as it's an isolated case, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but are we going back two years, which in 1998 forced you to organize it?
I went to the Edlicki Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm playing a saxophone, I've also organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our host Lady Angelovich says, it's a little out of control (laughs).
The popularity's only come in the last few years, or am I confusing something?
True, it helped us to start joining famous singers and actively working to promote the band.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can appreciate is essentially as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make The Tap Tap so good?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that imitate one another.
It's logical that everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, pity, is naturally...
But that pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned individuals we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's not just for them, it's for society as a whole.
Was it successful that you were a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and maintain some discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, to attend preparatory courses, and to spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
He is currently a member of The Tap Tap 20.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Just one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fleda Club and Ostrava at the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telebridge at the time the song "The Tap Tap" "The End of the World" was performed.
The objective of the project is to raise funds of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlicki Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, free for children under 12 years of age, and can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
But Poland's journey to space started a lot earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always understood.
I would like to remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who, on 6 December 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "Introspection in Space".
The young engineer's ideas (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Awards for "Introspection in Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned promoter of space, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway drone equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the draft.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should have been used to disperse or to brake the trolley.
Only the press of that era is aware of this threshing.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzycki.
The remaining material shows that the research has reached the practical test stage.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket, proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work of "Air Torpedo Missile and Aeroplane Bomb" by author Levy-Kivoblocsky came out.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczawy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended with the outbreak of war.
The following scientific work on space was published in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a reference to society in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problems, which publishes four long articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed the organization of a space society.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics ' Society (POA) has tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951), and as early as the autumn of the PAA became a valid member.
The following year, Kazimez Zarankevich, the first president of PAA, became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation (1902 - 1959).
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, which was capable of overcoming a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and had a weight of less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested in the summer of 1959 on the Bled desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 metres long and had a weight of about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to carry out the actual scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could cross 14.5 km and its mission was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed to be two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (defined as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed and varied in size for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A had an area of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C 0.62L.
All three types had a maximum flight range of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, Meteor-2 was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2, with a start-up weight of 380 kg, was able to lift a 10 kg payload to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
Mention should also be made of Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR national committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Marioslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repealing of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The ruling generated a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the large differences in labour costs (wages), price pressures arise.
This term should be understood to mean the condition that a producer, by delivering cheap goods, tries to compete in economic competition by "determinating" the value of a rival in order to take over most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means either for most entrepreneurs to move production abroad, or to buy cheaply abroad, or to disappear, as a result of which unemployment increases in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including unemployment, the inevitable social spending of the State is increasing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of the Lords of Entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Cerebral private capital practices have created situations at the level of individual economies where national Governments have to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments give their own people private capital at will, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to force their people economically to comply with the private capital dictatorship, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a means of reducing workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, the level of poverty and, at the same time, the gap between the poor and the rich are increasing.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves with their own labour.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases in which employed persons receive wages such that the State must pay them more to obtain a subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people under pressure from a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a poor wage on the margins of society, in the hope that private investment capital will ever arrive in the country.
However, he wondered where he would come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty moves from one country to another, or it does not come at all, as a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy and that a managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insisted that the State should not interfere with the economy by the managers.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the entire State, is not acting for its own selfish purposes.
The answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all States.
As a result, we have a desperate situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment but is not a crime.
The situation in the Federal Republic of Germany is that government ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the drafting of legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracy is now quickly in a situation as described by Appian in the work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar's and Pompey's Days": "The State has long been disintegrated and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Ransoms, illegal charity with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption have flourished without any prohibition, and people have gone to elections with a pre-sold vote." ... decent people have never run for the position of ruler, after all, the state has been left without a consul for eight months." .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As in ancient times, today ' s society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended to be used for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any attempt at deeper reform.
So the cause of fascist and communist regimes must be found in the reckless liberalization of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not permanently.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is thus systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s share of the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: The chaos lab.
"Nothing can come out of violence, and can never come out of it." Sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of the refren is the words: "Don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted wars, they wouldn't have been" - the dying Gutel Snapper, the wife of Meer Amchel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many reactions.
Some argue for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence and that the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who in these recurrent waves of killings is the criminal and who the victim, after all, today ' s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their steps entirely on their own, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards the intended goals.
We must be allowed to live at a time when the world ' s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
One of the astronomically rich families is one that could be seen as a head of spruce (I don't know if anyone's above them, but it's not excluded) - Rothschilds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s to stop the rumors linking their name to the criminal activities in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadows, which always led to the strengthening of their power, the expansion of wealth, or both.
They have large stakes in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have a share, they conduct or prepare a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were only seven countries after the invasion of Iraq, there were five countries after the overthrow of Qadhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took over the central bank of its country).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to release his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (fed reserve system), was killed in 1963, and Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a three-world war plan created by the great 33rd-level Mason Albert Pike.
The goal of the first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion (so many slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume many resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and to finally seize absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (orner ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the FED foundation, which should have prevented a recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to launch the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the king's Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, military and economic surrender by Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the king's Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than pre-empting radicalization of impoverished masses, then only left the Germans with a strong enough, judgmental and simple solution for the Chief, further creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed playing the function of the fifth column, in fuelling war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfur declaration pre-empted the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began to clash with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out, it's hard to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which the bankers originally held him, or what he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations at World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a place of war for the third.
If international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victim of fighting on the front line, now with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is responsible, and who is the victim, of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment creates resentment in the endless cycle of violence when it begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish Israel's ordinary people from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers encourage people to vote exclusively for their own candidates.
Israel's current Prime Minister, Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Ormuz, which contains 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their image is the world of God and of slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And makes all the small and large, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave have a brand on his right hand or on his forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
This is wisdom: Anyone who has reason can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
Operation Argo: When it's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demonist students captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, no positive outcome was foreseen - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, she was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a Promised regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations facilitated by the Algerian Government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential elections that culminated in Ronald Reagan's election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one episode of the story that brought America small wins.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult period, they finished their journey at the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, was able to recover them from Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover legend that they were travelling on Canadian passports as part of a film crew looking for a place in the country to film a science fiction epipe.
Combination of genres
The plan that the evacuation expert Tony Méndez invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film's design, held press conferences, and a fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Méndez's memoirs.
Affleck's movie is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political trellaire, so-called "film-kinopus", a story of a good idea, a scam, can be an example of a series of movies about Owen's friends.
The film constantly changes the moods - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (titres show landmark historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there is no great difference in this).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies-- the men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the agency stairs, on the phone...
Ben Affleck had a great career re-start.
From a mocking actor, he became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and Triller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film not to be made in the hometown of filmmaker Boston.
The sense of the place is one of the qualities that raised earlier film directors above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is showing it in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are remodeled - the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when history suddenly changes.
Affleck and his colleagues have a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narrative did not involve many exciting scenes of film.
He's working pretty well with a few of them, sometimes he's thinking about something -- it's not so elegant out there. (The scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the runway chase looks pretty far-fetched.)
Argo's disadvantage is a lack of attention to the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are indeed very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a little drama, which is a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing the production and retro-steel that recreates the Trillers of the '70s.
But it's hard to capture.
This is enough, however, to remind us of one, still in a certain sense, living history, as well as to show how exaggerated the perceptions of omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence services are.
Rules for air balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com portal, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to declare a competition for "the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop".
"We are encouraged by this latest development, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," stated "the Rule" by the questionnaire organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities that have already been nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the premium rate for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The EU regulations in dispute include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-materials to fuel, which is harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury degrees only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or a policy on the size of chicken cells, which has led to a significant increase in the number of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term "battery oil" or the removal from the sale of classical light bulbs was also criticized.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic now even under the threat of the vet defending the claims of its banks).
The lobby's interests are as follows: for example, the top-quality bananas in the European Union should have been as long as 14 centimetres and would not dare to be "anomalally crooked".
In doing so, the European Commission was justified in only harmonizing existing fragmented national regulations that had complicated trade.
The EU, despite resistance from some States, had nevertheless relaxed standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives would lead to waste of products.
The EU regulation last year, according to which selling balloons must be given a warning that children under the age of eight cannot blow them without the care of adults, may also be a candidate for the survey.
The EU has turned to American research, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are not allowed to blow into fairballs.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: everyone with an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, but should instead say "BURM" (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the liberal economists' association Laissez Faire, has proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks on the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established a maximum level of food reserves that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established quantities of canned mushrooms, for which it was facing a large fine.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of grants for applications for grants.
But these ideas came from Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We'll ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palace, in autumn 2004.
He argued that there had been a high grain harvest in the country and that, as a result of the so-called interventionary procurement, the State had complete stocks that had to be removed.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palau, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission approached the Czech Republic with a tender for grain from landlocked countries.
The grant was offered to villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU), in particular by the application for grants from Brussels.
EU: Fancy orders are the exception
Although regulations in member States are easily criticized, the EU's regulatory efforts, as well as the more efficient functioning and development of the EU, are, in the view of many experts, more worthy of recognition.
In the view of the experts, it is a serious problem to draw on EU grants for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member States have achieved in discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, like other European countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomowsky cheeses", the "Tuzem Roma", whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, our producers were to change their name to "Tuzemak".
Only products of cane distillate, not sugar beet, can be called rum.
The official list of EU registered products, along with the world-renowned feta and gorgondzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or parm ham, has already been found, for example, Carlovar sushi, Hmory and Trzebonsk carp, and harvest ham.
The EU's trademark can also be proud of the Pardubits Spinner and the Hairberry Tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to run for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in the country worked without any trouble, I wouldn't be running for office.
But I can't stand to watch the country slip away over the last 20 years, the way thieves are fussing around, people getting tax and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent man who doesn't belong to any party, I have no other way of influencing things than running for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've always said that I'm gonna be part of the presidential castle fight, depending on the result of the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
So I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the problem is not only that we as a nation are in our bar or on TV, but that we are willing to crush anyone who tries to change anything.
In addition, there are media that stigmatize a person and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I bribed journalists, or that I was adviser to Jerzy Parobeck.
Let's move on to your views.
You started fighting for the presidential castle by talking about the pecuniary and criminal responsibility of politicians and about return property declarations worth over 20 million.
In order to do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only an entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbyed as a citizen for the tour to become a free enterprise, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics -- when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately fix the obstacles, and it keeps citizens from doing it.
As an independent non-party man, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what's best for our country and apply it without taking a look at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left person.
It doesn't matter to me at all whether it's a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being right, it's about someone being left, it's about bringing people together.
I will always support any good decision for the public whether it is proposed by the CCM or the CDP, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in the world, or are spoken of by eminent experts.
But without the Parliament's support, you will have only slogans.
And with that in politics, you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you will be able to assume criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to their side so that we can do our thing.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to have a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality that speaks out of abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a credit for the public pressure.
I'm telling you right now that I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just starting in politics, and for my program, I'm gonna try to get the majority support.
I'm trying to move forward on my own; if I fail, I'll be done in six years and back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save Czechia.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not the only one who's gonna do anything, so I beat a number of famous people with an offer to run for Senate.
I went to Radio Yanchure, he refused because of a lot of work.
I have also at least supported a leading investigative reporter, Jan Lorentsov, who uncovered the fraud of light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm in the balance.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, but most of those who went to the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that changes would be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what about your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Superb for a million, and a few million more in the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin came up with me because it was my boy's dream-- I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, was galanten with women, and at the same time fought against depravity and lawlessness.
You go to Aston Martine, you own 60 million worth of property, and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I've invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs are basically gonna cover my senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, for example, could pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were gonna cut this down?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I've reduced my activity in part.
For example, my deputy will be managing the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be the spineless man who will keep the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
As an entrepreneur, how much are you used to getting monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which goes on.
And if I were president, I'd be done doing business.
You'll find a full interview on Saturday's newspaper Law.
The MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in imagination - the example of Speykenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, passing on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large business, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
No one ever voluntarily goes to these old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Peikenisse, a small-scale bedroom town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate fact, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are shown on euro bills, in the form of paint-painted iron concrete miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only chance to beat the statistics: to build a library here!
Vince Maas of the Rotterdamian Architectural Bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical, structures, took up the task with his usual unforgivability and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while members of the jury were perplexed and shrugged with their shoulders, the daring Maas folded out of his original gift a pyramid of size and completed the speech in defence of his project with the words, "Dear citizens!"
Here's my offer: Book Mountain in Speykenissa, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain grew at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of a renewal project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several surrounding dwellings and townships for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "The Book Mountain" was awarded the second award for Best Library in the Netherlands 2012.
The project also participates in the National Dutch Woodwork Competition 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which had previously been unable to offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian area and a surprisingly ugly town hall whose white facade suggests a milk plant, has become richer than one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, Speykenissa is the first public cultural building in the history of this town.
Long way to the book
The first impression is that Eldorado is booked under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator going through the center of the mountain range, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore this area on foot.
The room on all sides - bright and easily foreseeable - the floors of baked bricks and the elegant street lights are infalliblely creating a sense of public urban space.
The urban environment is being recreated perfectly.
The look is involuntarily looking for benches, dogs, and football boys and girls.
And there are books, books, books everywhere.
"The usual book shelves are along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncool and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We put a classic configuration of the space from the top to the head and pulled out the area to read from the outside.
The inner space of the book mountain has been well used, with offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and technical facilities located in the centre.
The black book shelves, which serve as those walls, parapets, and stairways, are particularly encouraging.
Their kind, their texture, and their smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guesses, what kind of unknown material is this?
"We have sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Speykenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, at an agricultural enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as root pads.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, this painting - for the first time in this volume - was pressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbowplastics (KLP) becomes dark, homogeneous, solid material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
They lead 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who passes a path nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only by a fantastic view of the city, but also by Dutch croquets and wood chips in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," Trouborst says.
The heat of the ground is used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only enters for a short time.
Large-scale adhesive wood farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, cast shadows and take over most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was already here.
As well as the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speykenisse that had long been lacking."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to take empty seats on the shelves of an incomplete library, which at that time contained 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are fixed upstairs.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves to decorate.
Thus, the MVRDV was able to solve a royal problem called the creation of identity on a professional jargon.
Speykenisse wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think she supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote to establish a no-flight zone.
As a result, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from a policy that the US, to what it is said to have ruled, to a German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just finding their part, but they're on their way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy followed by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position that is independent of the position of the US or European partners in its national interest.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests were very different from those of other large States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the voting at the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to insult the public and elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to that, it's not completely one-sided.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relationship with the US by abstaining in important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are differing views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the United States clearly supported the veto.
Is there a divergence of views between the US and many European states?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government is deeply aware of the European position.
But with regard to the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that the substantive differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not very excited about Netanyahu politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partner on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, consistent European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and have to act instead on the basis of their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties to Israel.
The subject has always been sensitive.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany still taking the lead hard?
Germany is not yet used to it; it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it has always been difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis — every time Germany takes an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
The Germans aren't just dealing with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse position than the US.
It must take into account the diversity of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who's left?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it's making you feel bad, that's life!

"Protecting Trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is the world-famous brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a brand name that's officially registered in China that has nothing to do with the firms it's formed from.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names bring an action.
But it is also unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to defend their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, who specializes in trademark rights violations in the Far East.
There's a new case of this kind every week on my desk.
Simulators add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci makes Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the manufacturer of sports products Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the Trademark Registration Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also uses the name of Ermenegildo Zegna's fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloh's cases are not the same, and on instructions from his trustees, he is opposed to Chinese enterprises being granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai," a brand-passenger.
That word is associated with "ban dakuan."
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities won't plead guilty.
"It hurts business, it needs to be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
"The brand is blurry, the unique position is lost, the image is suffering very much."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copies.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with a sales volume of Euro15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult and costly to remove questionable records in the trademark register.
The trial may last up to nine years, with unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed claims because after a long period of time, the disputed name became "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarizer because he damaged his Chinese trademark, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine manufacturer Sony, a company that had recently acquired Putzmeister's concrete-sucking company.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue-white logo similar to BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products, Lacoste, lost in China to simulations from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 owing to a shortage of staff and equipment.
But last year, there was a "return from an emergency in the working process to the norm".
Thus, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending with the agency.
It's expensive to fight.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has led the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth consecutive time, reporting to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 Yuan or 160 Euros.
It is worth many times more to challenge, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Convergence has fought against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to ensure that their illicit production of counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the simulator has reserved Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was his own omission, as names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Authority rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Freudenberg won, but the other side is still fighting.
You need to be on your guard.
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves."
Domestic costs are unlikely to be accounted for, and the company's archives have had to look at even a hundred years ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side "a larger six-digit amount in euros" for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how much it costs us," Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East are threatening even Europe.
That is, if the simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The Concern had long ceased production in those areas, but had been able to prevent registration.
"You need to be careful," Ventzler says.
Both he and Pattloch's lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; rather, foreigners should "all that is worth protecting should also be registered in China", Ventzler said.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in his last trade mark act, he will have to pay the opposing party a licence fee for his own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we're out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Slowing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's choir is rehearsing, and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relationships that have crossed a distance of more than 8,733 kilometres.
First the drowning takes place: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's slippers pick it up on the floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
It's only then that the voices of singers -- alt, bass, tenor and soprano -- slowly increase -- they come in, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost bounces out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and spectacular gestures.
Monday evening, in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology, the choir of Imbonga is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years of age, from a human geneticist to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of a choir has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-help
The United Nations AIDS programme estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, over 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeni, Voices for Africa found leaders in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take charge.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Centre.
An imbongi in Zulu means a narrator or a glorifier.
They don't talk to the Bantu in this room, but they can sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language, and from time to time even bringing them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir, is located 8733 km away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
40 per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, and there are many children among the inhabitants.
More than 300 of them have been left without parents who have died of the HIV virus.
In Esitgeni, Swaziland ' s disease is miniaturized: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the foreskin in men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost non-existent among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population is carrying an immunodeficiency virus, and death at mid-four is not uncommon.
The Glee Club opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but previously the Imbogna members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but also just food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants - for a few euros a year - to send a child to school and allow him/her to receive hot meals once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Evidence of sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (honorrhoea).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viral STIs.
Pabcal lice and scabies are referred to as parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea are found mostly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidosis (grib), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among young people than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among our young people.
How is the number of infections changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Communicable diseases may cause genital ulcers, urination complaints, excretion, abdominal pain, and bladder or compaction.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can you defend yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In fact, partly sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through contact infection and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend regular testing, especially when sexual partners change frequently.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote effects.
Chefs, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany, make it possible to collect something.
"We've already sent nearly 200,000 euros to Esitgeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodaw Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares for orphans to be well - arranged, such as one of their grandmothers.
Gogosus, as they call it in Zulu old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, provided shelter over their heads, and made sure that children in uniform arrive on time every day in class.
Those who have no family come to the shelter of Hanisila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as do the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two hens and, together with the American Health Organization, PSI organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's related to sexuality."
Pretty unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-sanctioned lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of the IC virus in past years.
But it's also on vagrancy workers who spread the virus across the country.
There are free condoms on literally every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, the choir of Ibmogni travels every two or three years in southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black - not only does such a recognition bring good mood and joy, but even it has caused tears in front of harsh border guards.
The trip also always takes place in Esitgeni, where singers visit their children.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on a map, it is more than known in the Etsulveni valley.
"Go to Esitgeni, there's light," the people here say.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the stunning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on here as well.
NASA is opening ice on Mercury.
The Mercenger Zone has found evidence that there is ice on planet Mercury.
Ice sheeting can have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
NASA's space agency has proven ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in a special journal of Science.
The Messenger Zone has found evidence that the world's area in the shadows is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimetres, perhaps even up to 20 metres.
It's assumed that water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that hit Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the Sean Solomon probe.
Mercury's temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
It is not visible to Earth residents that probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth — small windows to endlessly given.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as a dwarf planet of Cerer.
Like Pluto, who turns around the sun for Neptune, Ceres, by the new definition of the international astronomical alliance of 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue dots, harder to identify in a star's circle pink "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation - scientists call it "W5" unromantic - opened by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.

Looks like a donut ring is made up of material that a star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant nebula of Trifid, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galaxy maternity hall.
The star cluster of the Pleiada, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, it's better with a color telescope.
As the red eye winks to the observer the nebula of the Snail in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation Water.
A resemblance to the Earth's continent brought this nebula to the nickname "North America".
A combination of normal and infrared photographs provides an expression of colour.
This new star in all its beauty was only photographed with infrared sensors from the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How did they come up is one of the great mysteries of astronomy?
Perhaps it's the fragments of Saturn's moon that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the water galaxy
Depending on the color, the images of the spiral galaxy turn into real works of art.
The photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand light years of Trifid nebula in the constellation Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-fold, three-part), since the dark stripes of dust divide into three parts of the hot heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation of Snakestar, astronomers photographed the precursor of a space collision: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two collapsing galaxies are facing each other and will inevitably run into each other.
It was the birth of the Hubble telescope star in the spiral galaxy M83.
Someone who doesn't like technical cuts can call it "South Cup Wheel."
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris' nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, removed for 1,400 light-years, consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal household dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a black hole ring that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This galaxy group, called Arp 273, photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The great spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars on our Milky Way.
The star's cradle is constantly creating new stars.
It's a star cloud connected to Rosetka's nebula, and it's also constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There's no dust in this bright, glowing galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when hydrogen was mostly present in the universe.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey, even before Galileo Galileo began to observe stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more and the spaces available to them have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here was five metres in diameter.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a "Big Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Grand Telescope Canarias has a giant interior device, the diameter of a mirror alone is 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the South African Great Telescope in South Africa is segmented for the sake of cost reduction.
However, it is about 11 metres in diameter.
Deficiencies of low-cost design: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its speciality is the high light-gathering power.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world ' s largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the SETI Project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
View at the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very Large Telescope" that's completely consistent with its name.
His four mirrors make it possible to illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum in the eye tube.
A European "Very Large Telescope" is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should spread over an entire 42 meters, and it would be made up of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of the Subarou and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a mirror of 30 metres in diameter, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here you can see the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been providing paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, especially those that can live on.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The photo captures the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched until 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and the galaxy.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, as the Messenger rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have shown that Mercury has ice.
Thanks to the "Messenger" probe launched in 2004, the first that revolves around Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink oil every day and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a bible age of honour.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Searching for a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a bible age of honour.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Searching for a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The trip through the Talib Mountains is wild and romantic.
A light-shouting minibus is rolling along a windy road past dense woods of hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant homes.
Everything is so green and bright, you'd think you were in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometres from here.
This is where the Taliqi live, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, who is not known for much, except that they speak well in Farsi and Azerbaijani and have a long life.
The final point is Lerik.
The small town is buzzing over the weighty architecture of Soviet times, which is not at all in harmony with the scenic mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too exhausting.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 kilometres, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here to the province, has not yet arrived.
Pilate Fatulaev (48), however, is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerica.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival in May, and next year we will have the festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulaeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen talytes of these places that are over 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the disputed star of the museum is the Chaban Shirali Müslumov, who is said to be 168 years old.
There is, however, no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person whose age has been documented is 122 years old, the age of Müslumov is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the Muslum Chaban add a few decades to its age?
Because even Rembrandt Scholtz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostok, has heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
"A striking number of elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hongza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholtz, "there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, owing to the lack of documentation, scientific proof of age was not possible because there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of drowned oil
Nevertheless, it is a fact that people in the Lerica area are surprisingly often of Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long-terms here in the south?
Azerbaijan's guide, Farid Mugimzadeh, explains this by the special genes of the talyks.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about nutrition.
Talyks like meat, bread, and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of drowned oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a high calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a primordial way of life that keeps people young?
At the age of 97, she was relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter that doesn't get tired of rolling around.
There are eight people living under the same roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two babies riding around.
In the kitchen, the guests are prepared for tea, which is served in typical gut cups of armouds.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under her headscarf she hides the long dark russian braids her son proudly exposes to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough for a living.
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought a grocery store in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after World War II.
But it got better when Gaydar Aliev's "loved father" took over.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan has little or no boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of the euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly pension, for local conditions it is a sum for which to live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-standing son is also right: "Stars in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care, and happy.
There's no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word "human rights" does not exist in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The competitive demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution, based on the Shariah, has met with a fierce rejection.
The Egyptian president wasn't niggardly.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but above all to Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, who are still hopelessly divided by a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended his jurisdiction "to save the revolution".
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. from the U.S. University of Southern California is not very clear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were carried out in a late 15-hour race with obstacles to an Islamist-oriented 100-party constitutional assembly, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use vague language and the resulting legal loft to better interpret the Shariah.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases relating to the Shariah, the University of Al-Ashhar, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, should be brought before the Council with great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy supervise the law, that de facto the restriction of the judicial power would result.
There is much to be interpreted in the draft constitution
Another problem is that the jurisdiction of civilians must be preserved before a military court.
These courts served during Mubarak ' s period of power to suppress opponents.
Following the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values".
Legally, this is so vague that public institutions can control even the content of films and literature through this article.
In open text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article expressly establishes equality between men and women.
But the other forbids the insulting and insulting of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable that "insult to human beings" is prohibited.
Will the cartoons of the president or the joke of a lawyer be enough?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in the draft that Mursi was proposing for signature, which he said would be submitted "very soon" to the Egyptians at the referendum.
"The Revolution has returned."
For several weeks now, opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who won third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was "in a history dump".
Through Twitter's short news service, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "put against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his palace and dump him," said oppositionist Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged," was quoted by Egyptian media as opposition to Khaled Ali's policy.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brothers, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of caution, not on Tahrir Square, but after a massive prayer on the other side of Nile to Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under blankets and salafists who cried out: "People demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi to clean the country and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
Muslim Brothers stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box where the country should go.
Most of it for the Islamist project, that's what's been decided.
"The notion of human rights is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Saeda is furious about this accelerated constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EDO) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or brought to trial.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights were indivisible for him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never appear in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to Welt am Sonntag.
The expansion of Mursi's influence over all three branches of government in the State disappoints counsel.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the President de facto cancelled it," Saed regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be payback.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Cancer: The Worst Smelling Fish in the World?
Norway ' s 5 million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely nasty fish dish?
Take some overgrown pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna get a smelly smell of cancer, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but there's an incredible characteristic smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a trout that is salted and wandered in water for up to a year, depending on the kind of soul you need to get.
As the twilight gathers and cools, the Norwegian crowd gathers for the Fagernes festival dedicated to this very, let's say, exciting dish.
"They eat it raw and drink it with a glass of aquavit, a local cumin vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and in combination, "a missile general" who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small-cube - sliced fish and drink a lot of liquor.
"Someone likes aquavit more than a cancer," says Howard.
This drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad - it's not much different from the sushi you carried with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when fish were drenched in hermetically closed salt water barrels in the autumn before the refrigerators arrived.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish were well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and used for food, with the silence of the perception of alcohol.
In the memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of immigrants being employed, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
Swedish residents (a longtime rival, not so long ago, and a much more wealthy neighbor) come here to work on a massive scale.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an unbelievable, albeit somewhat stinking, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything here is expensive - a small beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears on the world news, and most of the people in the country seem to agree.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Bravik, a right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called the "July 22".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens is capable of such atrocities and killings.
Norway's current well-being is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil isn't the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, who's dissipating trays with hard cancer, a woman with long blonde hair and amazing blue eyes, embodying nordic well-being.
We are a people who understand.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like showing up, we're not boasting.
Norway has been very careful with its oil, with most of the oil and gas revenues being invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when all the money they didn't have was wasted, Norway was saving all the money.
"As long as you can ski in winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough for happiness," Anna says.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in line in the snow for some food, and I'm done with the cancer.
A hamburger with salmon meat is definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But there's still more fish waiting for us tonight with an unforgettable smell.
At my hotel, there is a special dinner dedicated to cancer, during which voters determine by vote the best or perhaps the most fragranced fish.
There's a live TV show showing a host in a butterfly tie surrounded by plates with cancer.
It's like a Eurovision song competition.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what's your grade for the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yeah, Howard, here's our grade."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling out of a chair, maybe by taking over the aquavit.
Or maybe just by breathing in the smell of this fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, faces a difficult career start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly poor state.
This city is overloaded with transport and at a better time, and since Monday steel barriers have been built, cutting several key roads to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliamentary building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and take over the country.
He faces a challenge.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which is now in the process of completing its mandate, but the country has been mired in the war on drugs, which has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to combat violence," reported earlier this week to President Barack Obama of the United States in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto ' s political career was promoted as Governor of his home state of Mexico City, near the President of the United States.
In his hometown, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, views on the new leader were divided.
A Straight Man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
The inhabitants commend him for the revitalization of tourism, the development of resorts and the development of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new roads built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are very different from the roads with the pits and pits that were previously at the site.
His name plates are on the modern sports centre building and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We hold him to hope for real and serious change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Peña Nieto.
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are sorely needed by our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Oliver admits that after his 12 years of absence from the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the allegations of impotence made by the opposition to the new President.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision for the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, a listener.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the moist streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
The problems in the municipality are also severe in this mega-cities.
Earlier this year, troops were recruited to curb drug gangs in those areas; violence against women is particularly acute.
In the desert near a large landfill in the past two years alone, several dozen women were found dead.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico State during Mr. Peña Nieto ' s governorship, a figure that far exceeds that of the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became reprehensible when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, he could at best be said to have been unable to cope with the problem of killing women during his term as Governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinaia Buendia has difficulty holding back her tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
Marian committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body was washed up before that," she recalled.
There were signs that she had been beaten up, and the body was already dead.
Mariana's mother tells the story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to a crucifix with only one word on it: justice.
That was precisely what they said the family had been denied.
"The state officials treated me like an old gossip, disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's not right, it's not right, especially when there are so many irregularities and shortcomings around," she says.
President Peña Nieto will take on a heavy responsibility with her by wearing a presidential tie on Saturday.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be exactly the same president as the governor," says Oliver, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa fear most.
Bradley Manning hasn't complained of ill-treatment, pleads guilty.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires that the case be dismissed on the grounds that Manning's detention conditions were cruel.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment that he claimed he had been able to reschedule while in military prison.
During the cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort Meed, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the weekly visits to Manning by the prison administration for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence motion to dismiss Manning ' s case, on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and sufficient in themselves, was conducted the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with the kidnapping of several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks' resources did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed after Manning ' s visits by the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was held under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment of himself by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized".
The reports examined did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manninga ' s direct question about his conditions of detention, Fein claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his verbal concern about those issues and that the authorities who visited him had discussed those problems with him and had stated that they would be dealt with but had not been recorded in writing.
"They recorded "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in conversation," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a commission hearing on suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to be removed from the "trauma prevention" regime and reduced conditions of detention.
The military leadership explained that the limited regime of detention - lower than the one for suicide prevention - had been introduced for the protection of the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay to get them to cancel the injury prevention regime... so that my level of life could improve, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness due to severe heat.
He explained that psychologically, it's very difficult when you're not allowed to know how your fate is being solved and what's happening in the outside world.
"My world has fallen to Camp Arifjan base, the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave his mattress, blanket, slappers, a few clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because sleeping, or even lying in the daytime, prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly struck by light from outside the cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning over in bed at night, he said that he had been woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning ' s lawyer filed an official objection to Manning ' s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manninga was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he had made during his testimony on Thursday that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, he had been forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during the morning check.
Manning said he couldn't cover himself with a blanket during the test.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should leave a blanket that he could cover, but admitted that no one had explicitly ordered him to abandon him.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not in danger.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a pair of underwear or slappers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, his slappers and his glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and significantly reduce the sentence if Manning were found guilty by a military court, which was due to start his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it planned to invite Manning to confess guilt for less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The hearings are scheduled to resume this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees under the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges brought against Manning are complicity with the enemy, illegal facilitation of the release of data on the Internet, transmission of information relating to national defence and theft of State property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a Mexican-American story.
In the author ' s view, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of their inability to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked along the entrance corridor, approached the border control zone and remained frozen on the ground.
The signs indicated two steps: one for Mexicans and the other for Extranjeros.
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and they used to call me Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
I later focused on the complex design of an American of Mexican origin.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here in my grandfather's hometown, there was no need for a name or a complex design.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my dictionary is poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and became an extranjeros line.
I remembered that story a few days ago when Mexico's newly elected President, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The issues of immigration, drugs and trade, which were familiar to the Presidents of those countries, were on the agenda.
President Peña Nieto willingly spoke of the recovery of the Mexican economy, which will now allow Mexicans, with the same success, to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to enter into a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
Moreover, President Peña Nieto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and bitter old question.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, only a United States statesman can speak with even a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press, and among the elites of Mexican society, complaining that Americans are violating the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesum are filled with belligerence.
Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is the most complex.
Do you want to talk about offense?
There's plenty of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country and those for whom there is no such opportunity.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone, father or grandfather, was unable to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type - brown, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not what they see in Mexico.
Today, our lives are the dream of America, we went to good schools and we got good jobs, but we can't forget that even that dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
United States of America.
Besides, we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We're telling them the same thing.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as fake Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there is some friction between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly and Mexican Americans are offended.
She's a U.S. citizen, and she thinks she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican American origin have no sense of belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the U.S., they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my trip, that our relationship is already not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish a relationship with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent her in the US.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much offense in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States, what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still insulted for the way they treated their relatives in Mexico just recently.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can provide a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There have been familiar, meaningless debates about who started it; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time since the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip landed in the vicinity of the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians have been hopelessly caught up in their eternal conflict, the Middle East has been changed.
This may be seen in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have encircled many established realities in the rebel storm, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the storm that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope that this deadly impasse will be overcome.
War without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire signed on 21 November were to be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement that took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will declare that they forced Israel to retreat despite its losses.
Despite the destruction of some faction leaders and the blockade of 1.7 million residents in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Indeed, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new, influential and rich friends.
The resurgent regional leader Turkey, once Israel ' s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Hamas ' solemn supporters have claimed the establishment of an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by Hezbollah ' s paramilitary group to Syria, where increasingly Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad ' s power, to Jordan, where the King ' s authorities are threatening Hamas ' allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region took place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohammed Mursi's influence was strengthened by the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not focus on Hamas support.
On the contrary, the Muslim brothers are an organization much similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to be populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice could not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the hard line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel's "Iron Dome" missile system has justified the cost of its development and successfully destroyed many of Hamas's rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the US has remained faithful to its constant position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the beginning of the last round of violence.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis had been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel had managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the wall that entered the West Bank of the Jordan River, a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protected Jewish settlements, which continued to expand despite the illegality of such acts under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the 22 January elections, has merged with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they were given full power in the West Bank, would they not begin to launch rockets from there towards Israel, as their brothers in the Gaza Strip did?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and to suppress any attempts to lift their heads.
The hard-line supporters may win; however, their calculations may be rebutted in the Arab spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the most warm feelings for Israel, their domestic problems will be a priority.
Israel's defense budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of President Mursi of Egypt, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must at least take into account the long-term effects of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Reprisals are already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect, the growth of the Arab population, only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas have had to pay for the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external impulses.
There remains the only solution that the sane representatives on both sides continue to call for, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israel's concessions of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, which is not very impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which is long overdue in its decision to stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a more favourable position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967 in the light of the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never submitted his own peace plan.
After his return to the White House, he continues to show a reluctance to engage in a solution to the problem.
This is a catastrophic short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only if there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has enacted the Uniform Cigarette Packaging Act.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of disease-affected body parts contrast in contrast with the sad green boxes that are the same for all cigarette stamps.
Australia ' s first worldwide uniform pack of cigarettes and tobacco law came into force, replacing logos and colouring different stamps with a similar box of dreary olives with creepy images of sick body parts and images of children whose health has been undermined by smoking.
In addition to the different images and inscriptions that warn of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between packs introduced from this Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small print.
These are the most difficult conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to keep young people from smoking by depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion.
This decision was based on studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 never became smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
"It is clear that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey by packaging," explains Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown, for example, that the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia was one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so that those changes would not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were already considering doing so.
The tobacco industry was increasingly opposed to the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes are sold.
"This law will lead to serious consequences different from what was intended by its initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeit producers from China and Indonesia will supply much more such products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws encourage business growth.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claims that the demand for portigars and silicone case files that conceal unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (almost from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some 6,000 products to wholesalers and is waiting for a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures was, in the view of the experts, the popularity of social networks among the specific population targeted by those measures.
Following the enactment of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sports activities, and that prohibit sellers from placing cigarettes in a visible place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites from posting advertising online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you're selling tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet would seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, a public health research at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increasing number of reviews of brands written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he has spared no effort and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that industry is now more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry had even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: those States had submitted claims to the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been subject to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all those countries ' trade relations with Australia were very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory smoke-awareness photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of strengthening laws is being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia have been defiantly disobeyed by innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little girl.
James Yu, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in central Sydney, claims that the same package made it difficult to place the goods on the shelves.
"I used to have an hour to unload my new shipment, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and ban cigarettes altogether, we'd say, what to do, okay, it's over, we close the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
It's not so bad to miss the world of electronic networks and continuous connections.
On that Thanksgiving day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and neither books nor magazines, nor iPhone, nor even duty-free shops will be very helpful.
Recently, however, a growing number of scientists and professionals in child development have argued in favour of boredom.
They say it's not so bad to miss us and our children in certain situations.
This forces the brain to focus on interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should try to get bored.
Yes.
Not at the same time.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, according to Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011".
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin boredom inscriptions dating back to the first century.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on the subject and asking a 100-person question to the task force, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people "want but cannot do what would please them".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do something he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing about boredom, he says, is "disturbing attention and the consequent deterioration of the mood and the feeling that time is slow."
The description of boredom may seem very depressing.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and depressed people see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel we're bored when it's just really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study "The Unemployed Mind: Defining boredom in terms of attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment that listened to the recording of the magazine's voice.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an unrelated television programme in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly be debriefed, and a third group listened only to voice recordings without an outside soundtrack.
Those who heard a low volume TV said they were bored, more often than others - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know why and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neurology at Gwelph University, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "e.g. looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed that he continues that when people start swinging on a chair or drawing karakuls on a piece of paper, they do so out of boredom, but now we know that in fact, such actions just help to keep them physically calm.
"The study has shown that children who are not allowed to climb and spin learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still," Professor Fenske states.
At some point, we're all bored: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980's, researchers developed a special "blindness cap" to measure such individual characteristics.
For example, questions and statements are used to determine the assessment on such a scale, such as "many of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so I don't have time for anything."
Through such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys are more likely to miss girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external annoyances.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with the help of a pager.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
Only 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he doesn't have a record of what kind of boredom data would be now, 21 years later.
He knows, however, that "adolescents have a peak of boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom good?
Sometimes not, because in extremes, research shows that it can encourage people to engage in absurd and dangerous physical activity, gambling risk, or substance abuse in an effort to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanović, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that's boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this very brain doesn't always know exactly what to do.
If you get bored and direct that energy to a guitar game or cooking experiments, you'll do yourself a better job.
But if you watch TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop bored, but he won't learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment, Professor Fenske says.
"And such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations," he argues.
Your child not only learns to take care of himself, he also learns to control himself at all.
I don't think there's any need for boredom to be extolled.
But it's not a bad thing either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable, even outside the continuum of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so that we need to be bored more often, while boredom is a very unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get out of their constants and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of sense organs," he says, "and when there's silence, we lose and don't know what to do."
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and a student at a community college in the south-east of Colorado state, is charged with a criminal offence that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that, once in September, he and his friends were in Lamar, driving in a car on a Praia near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was summoned to court for possession of drugs and possession of a drug-use device, minor offences for which a fine of $100 is due, and a trial date has been set.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues a few weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small court cases depend not so much on the law as on the place where they are dealt with.
The charges of minor marijuana offences are already dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the State of Washington, which has taken a similar measure.
The police stations have already stopped pressing charges against people aged 21 and over for keeping small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative Colorado districts, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing cannabis cases and continue to be held accountable for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, they vote to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from appearing in their places.
"It's all moving so fast that I don't even know what to do next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora town east of Denver.
Control authorities in Washington, too, are perplexed to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which must be done before 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for the Regulation of the Production and Marketing of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, acknowledges Mr. Smith than to put forward any proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent to be guided by," he says.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will bring the state into uncertainty for a year when there is no State licensing system and marijuana ownership is now legal.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between a state regulation on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana, with a ban on trading it 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading enterprises in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group "The marijuana legalization centre".
On 21 November, Police Chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates stating that the City's Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer hold those who had reached the age of 21 to account for the possession of a small quantity of marijuana, and that the police would stop exposing people to such violations "from now on".
The Chief of Police, Oates, reported that the police would monitor the city ' s compliance with the regulations governing health-care marijuana growers and prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
The Well District Attorney in North Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
Following a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage users to undergo treatment.
To date, 119 persons have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other violations.
"The obligation of our institution to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission", said Mr. Bak in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as Mesa Rural District, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possessing a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger upheld the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already open cases involving the possession of marijuana.
"I believe that it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people in Colorado who voted supported the decision, the inclusion of marijuana in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reactions of residents across the state revealed the mixed attitude of local authorities towards the state cannabis experiment.
"The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard," explains Sean McAllister, the Denver lawyer representing the interests of convicts for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana laws.
"They've been chasing people for so long, they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small number of marijuana in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a pilot field across the country to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legitimates and state officials are planning to expand the legalized trade area, but they are awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will yield to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the Federal Government has, in most cases, given the benefit of the drug trade in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Drug Bureau agents are unlikely to break into houses to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-controlled recreational marijuana stores, which are authorized under the new law, as Kevin A. Sabeth, a former drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have opened any sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we're gonna license someone, and then it's gonna cause serious federal problems," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
We now have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and the State ' s vote.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was left of Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogy to the antiquity symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization — freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the University of Oxford College of History, at the end of the eighties, I packed my suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't bear to cry.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. Norman Wilson was joking that I left because I had to drink out of crisp cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this famous cradle of enlightenment, it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.
You're gonna ask me why you're gonna think about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with a right-wing centrist attitude has been subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that accorded to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College of Christy College College in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwanted" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only been exacerbated by the recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "The Country of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were presented as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who drives a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and a silver cane.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make scapegoats because of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, aged 20, Vice President of the Association of Conservatives of the University of Nottingham, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in the university environment there is a growing distortion towards left-wing views.
People who don't even know us think we're arrogant and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student at the College of History, Christy College, in which a request for enhanced protection was made, calls this an "unfriendly" atmosphere, and Stephanie Cherrill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the student club members towards the holders of the right-wing centrist views has deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual debate and simply to the normal lives of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just outnumbered, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a shy and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred for the conservative party.
One year earlier, the University had deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree by voting because of the budget cuts for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the early days of the freshman week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time that I was waiting.
I didn't know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but they took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues - the strike by miners, privatization and the Government ' s opposition to the application of sanctions against the apartheid Government in South Africa - have entered through the wooden walls of audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the eighteenth-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
I couldn't get a text, I got stuck.
Harry Pitt was a very bile man with a face like a cake.
"Is it a matter of principle that the Totcherists do not learn French, or do they simply lack brains?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few elementary French lessons in your spare time, if you're not very busy spinning around in society," Pitt punked.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat alone at lunch; then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Department, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Everyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend they're Labour."
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardlyly trying to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick didn't work out.
A freshman from the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They stab each other, don't they?"
I felt like I must have felt gay before the criminal prosecution of the 1960s was abolished.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I have to become a Labourist and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her matches.
He hardly ever showed up in college.
He despised him for being provincial, petty and committed to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London to seek refuge among relatives and impartial capital friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the '40s, all political opinions were taken into account.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said.
- They can't do that, but not in the city of snooping spires...
Even my Communist friends have always been impeccable."
His damp eyes are clouding.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of university."
I was exhausted by my regular trips to London and my emotional protection is weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not withstand pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during the seminar, when another history teacher called me "the enemy of the people" quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
In my heart, in shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed by my parents," and I called them "old fools."
It wasn't a long break.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to beat my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me crying and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory."
About the Valentino Master of Sewing, which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemics and other famous Italian designers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentino Garavani exhibit.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of Valentino: the Master of Style, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his home over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "I'll Signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his name clients.
Valentino always felt charmed by the rare and distant world of nobles.
In the first room of this exhibit, which was opened until 3 March, there are many personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agha-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise, from a humble tailor from Vogera in northern Italy to the world's "elita".
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They at least don't smoke their cigarettes on your gorgeous carpet, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemics.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an incredible host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains former Haini's wife Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beautiful women like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarjos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino.
The Argentine model Valerie Matzza remembers a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner at his house, after the fashion show at Spain's square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was in every detail of his apartment, in her cleaning, in her food, in his music.
"All of Valentino's guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" whose work with the modeler began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion because his sketches are real art," she ends.
The genealogy parade
Harwani's life isn't a story of obsession, it's a story of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One gallery, Somerset House, was transformed into a glamorous platform of 60 metres in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must dephilate by diatum, looking at "specters" from the dreamings that shine from Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that used Monica Vitty in the Nights, or the coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress of Far Dib.
In this audience, model names such as Sybilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Torn und Thaksis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Gabsburg are shining.
Nati Abascal and Designer, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "I can't forget."
I remember him perfectly.
They were pants, a shirt, a vest, and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Nati Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Fería.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light in them, and they come up to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino either.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, the hour of the late 1990s came.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at the feast at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with hamstrings, a "corn" in a fold and a cut without a brittle.
"It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is extraordinary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her birthday dresses from a designer with "maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a combination of memories that accompany him."
"The King of Fashion"
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Shantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler calls her seams) to make this silk-colored elephant with pearl incriminating, twelve different types of laces and a plume of four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzie Menquez, the greatest authority in the specialized press, the dress is a milestone in the late 20th century, "returning clients from the highest world".
Overwhelmed by years, the "life style" of the elite, Valentino himself is now its best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Commissioner, the Commander of the Order of Art and Spokenness, awarded by the Legion of Honor, Garavani has gathered as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"Always my attention was drawn to his subtlety, his calm, his neat and impeccable appearance," D'Arenberg recalls.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a dinner party at the Ors Museum.
He sat at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't exist for him."
If the princess says so...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Igena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep rock trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living from sulphur mining in the Kawah Idgen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto goes down to the bottom of the crater, where the blue gas that comes up from the depths of the Earth is locked in contact with the air.
Huge pieces of sulphur, with a total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, pulls baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a rocky rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, it takes only 250 metres, but tired loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb a turtle's step, struggling to maintain balance and carefully finding the road so as not to stumble or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rock a few years ago.
The cashiers from Kawah-Ijen earn 5 Euro cents per kilo of sulphur produced
When they get upstairs, they make their way between tourists who take pictures of them as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the scales that the mining company has set up slightly higher, at an altitude of 1.850 metres.
This is PT Kandi Ngribi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better or worse, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) of petrochemical production, since this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"As the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about Rs. 46,000 (Euro3.8) for each walk," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to save Rs. 138,000 (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a miser for such an inhuman effort, it's three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, where coffee is paid Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and the average monthly wage is Rs. 2 million (Euro167)," explains a freighter who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a valid reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are some Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he can't breathe, he coughs all the time, and his eyes are gonna cry because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking his life in Kawah Ijan, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are gonna cry because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
With his life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a hotel porter, but instead he's doing a mule job.
A dirty wooden hut with other porters, it rises every day at 2:00 a.m. because sulphur does not cease to flow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the darkness.
To challenge the shadows, Anto goes down into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry a basket of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur production to save costs and has not provided any equipment to porters who work in their own account and with such hardship.
In fact, they do not even receive a portion of Rs. 30,000 (Euro2.5) of the photo collection fee, which, along with an entry ticket of Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2), is charged by the guards of the reserve to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
"This work is for livestock, not for humans," says Badrusin, a root porter for 42 years, who has spent three decades in Kawah Igen since he left college.
With the ability to raise to 110 kilos, he said that he would tolerate "as much work as he could" because he needed money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns its throat and burns its eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense poles of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual breathing problems, artroses, knee pains, and shoulder ulcers, which were deformed under the weight of baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Uninik can only raise 50 kilos in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur out of a volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres along a narrow path among the bushes.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works as a sulphur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates generation-to-generation poverty as one of the hardest occupations in the world: what the human mules of Kawah-Igen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans blame careers, stress, and housing and education prices for the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm the husband of a patriot, you're my wife of a patriot, and you're gonna do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the marketing of mints, but this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore early this year, or perhaps because of it.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put bao in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, has the hope that they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do "their national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
That's the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing the likes of ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic that we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things, such as launch spirits with pheromones or organize quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, that's to write rap?
1.2 children
Who doesn't take this lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The Government ' s package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and for its strict social control.
Singapore ' s fertility rate, according to its National Population Authority, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was less than 2, known as replacement, was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapurs have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy Office for Married Couples and Families of the National Population Directorate, said that the reason was "improved education" and "broader gamma of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in Singapore ' s fertility rate.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration in order to counter population decline, is an outrage among the local population.
Singapore has websites where barely hidden xenophobia thrives on many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and reluctant to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party of Singapore has had the worst results in the elections since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Surprising consequences
While the fall in fertility has had a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying not to build so many small housing units.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved to control the number of small apartments known as the shoe box, which can be built in certain parts of the city.
These 46 square metres apartments are sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is a perception that they can contribute to a single life and discourage developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of the house-building firm EL Developers, says that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger ones.
As a result, our monetary revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new regulations provided clearer guidance to developers who had previously been hindered if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overworked.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to the Singapurians who work in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as is education, and so many people delay it," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and housing and education prices as factors that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, with regard to childbirth, the final word is for the Singapurs.
The personal offline is personal online.
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is a private or "sphere of private life which has the right to be protected from any interference".
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Did he understand the dangers to which the Internet was exposed in situations that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very much mine", in a personal way, and "password and username" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't download to the post," says the ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had records for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I download beautiful pictures or images from games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine or someone who was being stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish dirty photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on the FB and nine of his Twitter flyers.
Most of them are related.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just loading them up," he adds.
"Social media - entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he points out.
Without wonder, he answers that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't take credit for someone who recommended it to a stranger.
Jose's 14-year-old case is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or telephone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became Ask's follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy doesn't care about the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never knew who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not delete the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
It then explains the sequence of steps for setting the account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confrontational situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"But I know it's cybermobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and an education and learning specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a tool to search for information, but with the advent of these sites the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a teacher at Yale University and author of work, Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
Explains that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not sufficient to do so".
"So that they are selective, while it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them, lest they do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you, like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to celebrate?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Without the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and must also be on social media," she argues.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read social network policies in good faith.
By understanding each of the points, they have good reason to talk to their children about the prerequisites for opening a register on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be disseminated or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children not to talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at UNASUR ' s VI ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after the closure, but have confirmed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government ' s website.
To questions about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during the press briefs.
Journalists ' access to Summit information was always limited.
In the course of the day, only a video of the Presidential Assembly without sound "closed session, no sound" was broadcast in the press room.
A small amount of information that was distributed among reporters was transmitted by the spokespersons of some UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Umala's statement, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was also not distributed, despite the press's insistence on doing so.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be checked that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had tried to ensure that all journalists received transmission systems, but had limited information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which began hearing the statements of both parties in The Hague on Monday, as part of the indictment that Lima had brought against Santiago.
"We will observe and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we now represent in this international court," said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of differences, covenants and international tribunals", added Piñera, and welcomed the shaking of Umalu's hand against the background of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia challenged this week the Bogotá Pact, according to which it recognized the submission to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roussef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership of UNASUR has been suspended since 2011, following impeachment by its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit a little later in the afternoon of Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects among South American countries had been approved, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements".
He reported that action was being taken to improve "cooperation against insecurity and organized transnational crime, to increase access to medicines, to affordable Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the cumulative and effective risks of natural disasters".
Since Europe in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to broaden our productive base and anticipate a better future for our cities", Umala added.
"We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the link between South America's space, especially in the village and border areas... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were from Peru and were limited to cross-axial axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as a re-accession to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among its neighbours, was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before participating in the regional meeting that he looked forward to meeting with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of an international court contested by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (on Saturday), perhaps meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We shall review all these ways, which are not mutually exclusive, including a pact with Nicaragua, will require discussion with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can handle this as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will have the presence of Enrique Peña Nieto, the new President of that country.
Also at the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met provisionally for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela form UNASUR, although the latter ' s participation has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, stated to State television in Peru that Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "but now they are practically one homeland".
He defended, in this context, the South American Nationality Project, which is endorsed by the UNASUR countries.
"It is necessary to move citizens and workers freely across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back in time," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself to be a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States should be reduced and that those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights should be taken into account.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Juliana Assanju.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that, in due course, "there was some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be respected".
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to come to his territory for questioning an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it by videoconference, which could be made available from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk that Assanj ' s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a slight lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What really exists is the risk of his physical and mental deterioration due to being imprisoned in a small space without the ability to practice in the air.
"It affects the health of any human being," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a security of immunity that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights; we do not use that word here, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja's lawyer, Balthazar Garson, has been conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he said, "If Britain offers a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him by Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate "mediocreness, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not spoiled political villains, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that neither those journalists nor "neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries of the Hegemons dominate Ecuador" and added that, when re-elected, "it will deepen the revolution in order to continue its development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered that the desire of his Colombian colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime boundaries between the two countries, following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, was "fully justified".
This decision has not yet been implemented.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
They need to be processed together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile before the same court would be concluded well and said that "it is right for Latin America to resort to international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to a decision, however heavy it may be".
Regarding the possibility of standing as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost in the February 2013 elections, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he was on his way to a treatment that was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chávez's state of health is deteriorating," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had yielded positive results.
"I've been stunned," he remembers the difficult moment, despite the doctor's tact, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified -- he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest HIV patients in Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was admitted in 1994, and has overcome many obstacles.
He's been living with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years.
So even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him 'cause he had a cut.
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
However, without knowing their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "strengthen" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement so far is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", the head of HCG HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, pointed out that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depended on the extent to which patients had been affected by the immune system at the beginning of diagnosis, with better life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 were reported.
Simply put, the above means that someone who is diagnosed as HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "with control, can live without problems up to the age of 75", he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be remembered that Mexicans now have an average life expectancy of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the AIDS outbreak.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 deaths were recorded by May of this year; however, it is alleged that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it, that's how things are at our hospital.
At least we haven't had a lack of medication in the last 12 years, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, at the late stages of the disease.
He quoted the devastating data: "Nine of the 10 patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is diagnostics at an earlier stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people who request it."
The proposal is shared by experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as by patients such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by the fact that his friend did so and despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS phase and even suffered from Kaposha sarcoa, a cancer that is a common complication.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I'm gonna die anyway, I'd rather get high three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I practice, I take medication.
To date, all his parents know is that he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I have a mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to encourage those who are now in fear in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them be checked, if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, that's better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
His message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms at the counter
The gap between health programmes and a citizen is great, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara, who has taken up the problem of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, we've been given one or two before, now we've been given hundreds of bags, and that's very good, but it turns out there are those who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you want them?" is a popular question, with ehidence and condemnation, by social workers, school counsellors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, assured propaganda.
I suggest that we change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind counters; and that hundreds of them be placed in vending machines in public toilets in places often visited by young people.
It's not a promotion of debauchery.
It was not about paying for beer and motel, but Governor Emilio González replied when asked if condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
A total of 13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were registered.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are in the sexual route, 6% in the blood and 2% in the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people on one reported case who do not know about it.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
Procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law do not seem to be valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the judgement rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale in the Court of Bankruptcy of the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenceless in the face of the possibility of seizure of their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the order opens the doors to the leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies in the evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to competition proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first paragraph implied the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been created for that purpose, and the American Institute of Law had been appointed as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote, which is recognized as a critical mass of the competition for debts owed to the parent company by the Vitro branch, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition Proceedings.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of affiliates, Vitro's creditors who fought against him in United States courts, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpol Limited, would not have reached majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that she has been facing since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has been facing in attacking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote will reach its plenary, that is, five judges, because only three have voted.
In the event of a failure, a request for a certificate will be made, which will require a review by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae (a friend of the court) describing the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it exempts itself from the agreements signed by both countries to link it to section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it was noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency, which guaranteed equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
In view of the several months' delay in the complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Air Force Pilots has already discovered a bottled throat.
The institution, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is charged with obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund Bank IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be used to purchase shares from the Hotel Professional Manager Company.
As you know, Askarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Network.
Around Dragon Mart
Meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean weekend, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with products from an isolated country, with a residential area close to 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces that had cut off some of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
ACCA Death
Regarding the Government's rejection of the Senate's request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the Abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case had already been filed.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to settle long-term debts without affecting short-term housing developers, Homex places 500 million pesos worth of stock certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with the offer of interest every 28 days.
Competival appears
Created by NYCE, e-Quality, and Kernet, IT leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just come into existence, its goal will be to market software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector Hetin Reyes, a long-standing basketball traveler, has been involved in this sport for over 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhaging tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was put into sports for more than 60 years, as a small player, a basketball player, a commissioner and head of BSN with the Baymon Cowboys and the president of the Basketball Federation.
"I played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, director general of the National Team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all of the pictures and memorials collected for his long journey, bear witness to that.
Bayamon in the heart
With the most emotion, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of being a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Champions since 1967, as an agent, co-agent, or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From that point on, he continued to lead the "Cuko" Ortiz, who was the great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Want some?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bart then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who got his citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought Baymon the championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was the chief of the Federation.
By then, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Mincy on the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the US during an Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze if it wasn't for that Canadian judge who made us play the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as is the one who won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and crashed the US, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gaussa, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and Pikulina (Ortisa) playing again, but also the young (Havier) Tonyto Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Quihote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 90s due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Championship in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like Canito' Nieuss, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hurruitner to replace players suspended for disorder at the Mar del Plata Pan-American Championship, we won gold against all expectations.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performances at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level in the way Piculin did.
And it doesn't take into account his career in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good youth, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your biggest success in the federation?
In the early 1990s, BSN was ranked up to 17 teams in the season.
What are you gonna do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponsa play only in their own field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's unnecessary.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabelle, who's always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Wert, Texas, became a world-famous man, thanks to his leading role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R., in the "Dallas" television series, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil predator magnate, J.A. Yuing, in the Dallas television series, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died on Friday night due to complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a production studio of Dallas.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the landmark role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original show and in the sequel, was near Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, sweet and talented, and I'm gonna miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Gray in the statement.
Hagman's liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and suffered a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television with the role of a decent character in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl that Barbara Eden plays, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included well-received roles by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primamy Colors".
But it was his workshop interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of his glory.
The CBS drama series on the Yuing clan and other characters around it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shooted J.R.?", designed to make noise around the episode, full of emotion, in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated international debate and millions of dollars at risk in bookie offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the reply was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second-largest entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine, who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened her that he would charge her with prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others had reason to attack him.
Hegman played Yuing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an unfair businessman and an infidel husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put in treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s tombstone." said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "Here lies an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principal, also the hero of the original show, remembered on Friday Hagman as "a big one, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable to millions of admirers all over the world, and in the hearts of each of us who is fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" were shown several months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season was already completed, and the sixth was in production, reporting to the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
He was the son of an actress and singer, Mary Martin, from Fort-Wert, Texas, who was blazing in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy in the theatre scenes of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axelson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities lived.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales out of My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way," he said to Princea Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help scared patients.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and then," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it's gonna be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you're gonna be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
It's starting a course that explores "The End of the World."
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when religious professor Stewart Sharma decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the "long reverse" Mayan calendar, 21 December, which many people grabbed as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was ahead of him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic storm Sandy, a financial crisis that some call "long-warmageddon," and the growing conflict that will drag Israel, a place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week students at Rutgers Camden University (New Jersey).
If we look at what's happening in the world now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember, bad things are good for those who have apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers a course on the "end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Associate Professor Barry Walker is reading a course entitled "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios are offered that create certain human actions.
If nuclear material fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war might break out.
This month, students analysed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real - life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be credible and impossible," Wacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, professor of Latin American history, and his colleague, Amara Solari, associate professor of art and anthropology, came together to read a course called "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn't come," said Restal.
Despite the "no-fault destruction", students must study, prepare projects and pass final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night when the world is supposed to end", said Restal.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"Message ended in two hours," said Restal about his high-middle class, which was attended by 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks before the semester began from people who asked if there were any more places.
Students, in turn, assure us that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he'd seen all the apocalypse movies.
"I've never heard of a course to teach it," he noticed.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone the professor, said that he believed in the 21st of December.
"Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University from West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restal.
But he pointed out that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has been going on for centuries, where people respond to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches a course in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, referring to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
The Restal drew attention to what had been said for a long time about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people would immediately begin to think about the next date" or the philosophy that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless of this date.
Some people said they were going to end-of-the-world parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Communications Department.
