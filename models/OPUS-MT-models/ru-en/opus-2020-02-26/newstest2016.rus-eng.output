The social card of a citizen of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic payment tool.
The changes provide for the maintenance of the public passenger transport allowance.
Since 24 September, the arrangements for preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanov region have changed.
According to the press service, the Russian Government's government in the Ivanov region has maintained the public passenger transport allowance and brought the social map scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of FZ on the National Payment System.
However, the social card of a citizen of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
Thus, the replenishment limit is no longer set for travel as before, but in cash, with winter and summer periods of not more than 400 roubles, and summer periods of no more than 800 roubles for the current month.
Social card holders on transport receipts will now need to track the balance of money rather than the number of trips remaining.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier ' s fare.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social card remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social card arrangements will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed accounting of spending on a social map to the point where it is accurate.
In addition, it is possible to recover the monies credited but unspent.
We also add that the scheme of intercalculations with carriers is becoming transparent, since one half of the cost of travel is now paid by the national, and the same amount reimburses the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged on a cash card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport, Ivanovsk Region, reported that over 33 million social card trips had taken place in the region in 2014, and nearly 25 million in 2015.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million roubles are allocated for the granting of preferential travel to citizens using the social card.
As at 1 September, reimbursement for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
During the 911 call, the teacher confesses to the murder of a friend.
During the 911 call, a teacher at Shannon Lamb University told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come to their house.
Lamb pointed out that there was a doggy in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the contact of the deceased's family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note hand-worn on a white sheet of linized paper: "I'm sorry, I wish I could get it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who had run two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then travelled 300 miles to university campus, where police believe he shot and killed all respected history professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
The chief of police at Delta Lynn Baford State University reported that the university staff found out about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true 911 call shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to paint a picture of the motives behind Lamb.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a picture of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he had crossed paths in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended both.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems to arise.
One student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he was coping with stress.
Lamb earlier asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university employment regulations meant that a doctor's degree, which Lamb worked so hard to obtain, would not automatically guarantee him a teaching position.
University president William Laforge said he didn't know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "probably Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb won't be able to answer anymore.
The police attacked Lamb after his escape from campus while he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber rifle in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the Washington County Coroner, Metel Johnson.
His engine was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, he believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12000, and taught geography and pedagogy in 2009.
He received a Ph.D. in Pedagogy in spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and funny man.
Carla Harston told me that she was 15 years old and Lamba was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a great older guy who for several years tried to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Hayrston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been dating by now.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage being registered.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gautier in a brick house, the other side of which went to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She's really depressed," said O'Stine about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't date Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-director of entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburbs of Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss was on the night of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and a harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was seen.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We used to have fun and make fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, held seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Tuesday evening, around 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a candle-lighting memorial ceremony at Delta State University in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Reported by Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to a statement by the police that Lamb ' s call had reached 911 after Schmidt ' s murder, and that although Lamb had referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married had not been confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us states that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, and that the toys and children ' s goods ranger will ensure that regular staff and temporary staff will be able to work longer hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announced that it would start interviewing applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although months to the holidays, the purchase season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough staff in stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about dating Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons as well.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, "and I noticed that the seat next to me was open, and I was about to get hit by the Princess Diana," he said in the trailer to the soon-to-be-to-be documentary film Back in Time.
The movie starts, and it comes to me that I'm literally at a distance of my arm and in one fake sewn from a date with Princess Wales.
Back in time, a documentary about the film Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemequis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "this is the greatest movie ever made about time travel."
Back in time will be available at VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states in response to Russia's military support for Syria that for almost five years of conflict, there is no "military solution", and an increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon announced at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council — the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France — during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had "made the situation insoluble".
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in addressing the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump isn't joking.
Some tried to label him as a provocator.
Others turned their backs on him, taking it as a joke.
And some people demand a scandal.
But as much as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have not been able to do so yet.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump's advantage in two-digit numbers, and some are seriously asking what it means for a real estate magnate in terms of the chance of being nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry gave way to his most popular German Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super Committee of Political Activity, and the economic conservative Growth Club, recognize Trump's unbroken power and begin to pull out their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some numbers of interviews that suggest that the real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's cute ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at the University of Montmouth revealed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate magician.
By mid-July, that was 40%.
In early August, that was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
All of these indicators are at the top of the initial stages.
A survey of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of Republicans in the area were loyal to Trump.
Two-thirds of those voting for GOP would have won Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be upset if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say that they would be "excited" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next to the level of delight?
Marco Rubio, who's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they'll be "unsatisfied" or "dissatisfied" if Jeb Bush's favourite of conversion becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his bragging and insulting, 52 percent of Republican voters across the country think that the magnate has the right temperament to be president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington post poll held on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same man as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not a person who can be effective in the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they wear their master hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who the most likely winner of the GOP nomination was, four out of ten, said Trump was a favourite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of ten put a bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible Mitta Romney candidate.
However, this shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some scholars point out that such dispersion is likely to benefit Trump, while not supporting Trump is evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmooth in early September shows that Trump almost always enjoys majority support in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates.
He's ahead of Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Caseic and Chris Christy at 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson outrun a businessman for 19 points in a one-on-one hypothetical competition.
A little over half Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trump say they're sure of their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition to date is with an outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapes" two months ago in his campaign opening speech, the topic of immigration became the most relevant topic in the conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pose will turn key Latin American voters away from the Republican party and interfere with the rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, Donald Trump seems to remain in the same position.
The disillusionment of the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support from approximately half of the Republican electorate, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a man with experience in government.
And they're also hurting Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activities in Congress, with 54 per cent "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "in anger".
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexations in October.
The Russian Vice-Premier Olga Holodec stated that the Government was currently looking for options to implement the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 at a real rate of inflation.
It noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, by the time the draft budget for the following year was submitted to the Government.
In addition, Kabmin is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the Russians ' accrued pension.
Hungry noted that pension savings amount to 350 billion rubles.
The indexing of pensions in full for the following year is about the same amount.
According to the Vice-Premier, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay the fees for non-working citizens.
A hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Previously, the media reported that there were two options for balancing the public budget in the cabmin.
Why are eyelids often annoyed and red?
According to the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eyelids are the screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluffhritis ourselves.
The exit is simple:
Don't rub your eyes with your filthy hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for the eyelid.
At least one or two times a day purify the edges of the century from their accumulated harmful substances in a day.
The clean-up procedures need to be supplemented by warm compresses of therapeutic herbs (shalpheus, chamomiles) that thin the thick secret of the glands, and then by the massage of the edge of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pillows;
You don't use alcohol in making makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the thickening of the secret of the salt glands.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nukes created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating "fully".
This was reported on the website of the Central Telecommunications Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to "the US aggression and nuclear threat" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
The latest nuclear weapon test by the North Korean authorities was conducted in 2013.
However, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also tested medium-range and short-range missiles on several occasions, writing polyt.ru.
Girinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Girinovsky believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said that during the State Duma, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes fail," said Girinovsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the four-tiered who contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovsky announced that the current anthem needed to be changed to "God, the King is to be preserved", and the Russian tricolor replaced the imperial flag, writing a polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question was not whether Europe was hosting refugees, but rather whether the root causes of the problem needed to be addressed.
If Europeans care about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on the issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people feel secure.
"In this way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Let us recall that some 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission has stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of Islamic State extremist fighters may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to establish their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The inhabitants of the German city organized a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany had become a leader in hosting refugees, although it had recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts refer to significantly larger numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
The BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, a city whose residents provide migrants with a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister ' s question-and-answer session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the question-and-answer session is very much awaited by the Prime Minister.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's question-and-answer session, using David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six questions in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after he has appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silent during the national anthem performance on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has been criticized by a number of conservative members of Parliament and has been the subject of several leading articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention.
The spokesperson for Mr. Corbin stated that he was "in a respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow office, told Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective of" his conviction that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin ' s team, arguing on economics, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
Political correspondent Robin Brant, BBC, says that political differences are also "stuffed" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin's appointment to the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Union conference that the Labour Party had amended the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party had "full clarity" that it was opposed only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from Pound26,000 to Pound23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the courier's box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who had promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had "involved collective resources" to gather questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from Eilington North County said that the Prime Minister ' s questions gave rise to excessive confrontation and that he would refrain from witty answers and the exchange of contusions, instead pledging to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the Shadow Office, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor at the opportunity, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the House, John Berkow, to discuss the matter.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of the "marginal ballagan", often associated with the question-and-answer procedure, to the Prime Minister, but admitted several years later that he had failed to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s questions have become a key indicator of the leader ' s views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and their reputation as other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Cancelled in Yoburg" Homeless young people who learned to be photographers
Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former street kids found a way to master the craft and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhoods and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound is rising as Britain's wages rise.
The pound grew up against the background of salary growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of the offer to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, British earnings, net of bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a postponement of projections for possible increases in quotations.
The pound rose by more than 1 per cent against the dollar to $1.505 and 0.84 per cent against the euro to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Against a general background, SABMiller shares grew by 20 per cent as a result of a purchase offer from AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewers, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock grew by 0.9 per cent, against a background of encouraging news from a competing group of luxury producers, Richemont.
Recent sales data on Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - on the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Glencore stock grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant announced that it had been able to earn $2.5 billion in equity, which had been done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
The stock of the paper and packaging group, Mondi, was the leader of the decline in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to "sell".
The JD Sports stock grew after a sports clothing supplier reported an 83 per cent increase in profits before taxation for six months to Pound46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion.
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it was unlikely that such purchasing power would outweigh the increase in labour costs, he said.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi's stitch.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's sting in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA RTAs in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming Aldi injection of $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale stores and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and promoting IGA brands through marketing in mainstream media and social media and Adelaide Show events.
The campaign is joined by Ritailers and IGA suppliers, such as the Simmo's ice cream manufacturer from Dansboro, who offers tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners selling tickets to the South Australian League football league at a discount to permanent customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will celebrate its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA brands account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and are more cost-effective than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as traditional routers, so the market is more favourable to IGA rangers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will account for 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first stores, taking the sales volume from all the players present, but mostly from independent rhythmers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst of Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA's retailers could lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year, selling $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of food revenues and sales at a high fixed cost of Metcash could cost the company about 13 million pre-interest and tax revenues, Mr. Kirat believes.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Colles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash's food sales will drop by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the top stock manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noticed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board of directors contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has declined from 18 to 14 per cent since 2010, while Metcash's food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA RTs, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, owing to operational debriefing and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with Coles and Woolworths in a thousand positions weekly, and to assist IGA rangers in remodeling trade areas, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh foods and a wider choice of brand food.
Director-General Metcash Ian Morris says that price equations and trade space conversions are gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will make a net gain increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakisa supports President Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kirios and deserves more credit for his behaviour than criticism, as President Tennis Australian Steve Healy says.
Cockinakis, Jr. in a talented duet and often called Special Ks, was the focus of attention because of Kirios' shameful altercation with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly afterwards, during a hot qualification match in Cincinnati, the judge on the tower had to separate Kokkinakis twice and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Waurrinka had to put Kirios on the scapula, and I had to put him on the scapula."
Ever since Kokkinakisa was last seen breaking a racket after the convulsions in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at US Open, Healy is loyal to protecting Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomic in solitary confinement in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I'm worried about one thing, namely, that Tanashi was involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He did break the racket when his leg fell down on the US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when hopes fell, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at some pretty provocative US, Harrison, etc. situations, and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he fits perfectly into the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensive training, he's in great shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kirios for an important match starting on Friday, believing that "unusual consent" was the right way out for everyone, but expecting the Canberra guy to return to the team as a long-term player.
"In the first place, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the disputes around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has gained the strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary, I think, to get him out of focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to contain the flow of migrants.
There were disturbances at the border, with hundreds of migrants gathering in the border territory, which were severely affected by the Serbian authorities.
Stuck indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their home countries broke up tents and settled in the area.
However, frustrations have increased.
When a police helicopter was circling over them, the migrants screamed "open the border!" and yelled at the Hungarian special police.
Some have refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared "unacceptable" the expulsion of migrants from Hungary when more and more of them arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the collateral damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries are needed in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) whereby EU member States would host 120,000 more refugees, including those from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect immediate action on the part of Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, enabling them to block roads and expedite asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Wengia Peter Syarto stated that his country was also planning to erect a barbed wire fence along the Romanian border to stop the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News reporter Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "bottleneck" and border crossing point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees who are victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the country ' s Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, victims of war that are entitled to protection, a view that is sharply different from those of other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for human trafficking defendants.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of emergency," said the government spokesman Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the Associated Press reporters, who are at the border, have been monitoring the presence of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Djerdy Bacondi, the national security adviser to Orban, reported the capture by authorized authorities of 45 persons attempting to cross the border at the border itself, and 15 others at the domestic level.
They have crossed the border, broken the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative offences under the new laws.
The authorities are rebuilding the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passageways at the border with Serbia, bringing a rail car wrapped with barbed wire to block one of the passageways.
Disturbances broke out at the main passageway across the border near the town of Rioske, Hungary, as the Hungarians had set up an office space for people to pass through inside a metal container, and crowds had pushed each other in order to break through.
Some 20 persons were able to get inside, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and announced their denial of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up to her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among primary Democrats (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 per cent of primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of competition in the primary elections, the majority of Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have made up their minds with the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than they are in supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and the moderates, but that advantage has diminished.
Her support among the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton's democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now equal.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton outrun Sanders with a two-digit number of liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary Democratic voters throughout the country say that they would have enthusiastically supported Clinton if she had become a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her simply because she was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for it.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of primary Democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16%), then that now is the time for a woman president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton's supporters also talk about an association that links her to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It's also called reconciliations and chances of election.
Since the Vice-President was considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of primary Democratic voters wanted him to join the race - although one third felt that he should not.
When asked who they would like to see second among the party's candidates, the primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say that they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the best candidate for the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
Byden ' s record shows a high drop in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in the candidate, Democratic voters choose alternatives other than the chance of being elected.
Like last month, no Democratic or potential candidate is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key characteristics of their party ' s primary voters.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and credible people with good leadership skills.
Biden is the leader of all three, and Clinton's strong leader.
Thirty per cent of primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion about him.
Primary Democratic voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as similar ideological views.
By all these standards, about a quarter of the Democrats have no opinion of Sanders.
Although questions about Hillary Clinton ' s personal e-mail box and server continue to be raised by her Secretary of State, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not affected their general perception of her.
But it's a different story for American public opinion as a whole.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with its explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public ' s views on this were divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate over e-mail has not affected their general perception of Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion of it has deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party's voters to be honest and credible, this continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, both receive good marks in leadership skills.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than an honest man, but as Carson, many people have no opinion of him.
The error limit for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the national survey, Ben Carson was close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the last CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates won half of the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump massively, whose support rate increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS survey held the previous month's Fox News debate to 27 per cent in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is supported by all demographic groups, replacing Trump with Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasić, rolled back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hackabi, and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, ranked third with 6%.
The error limit for the sampling of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6 per cent, which was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's growth in the polls, showing support for 19% of Republicans behind Trump with 32% of support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump to be significantly ahead of Carson.
In response to Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical attacks on his former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student during a frat ritual in the Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"The members of the P. Delta Psi brotherhood from Baruch College in New York have brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Denga during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to bring him to hospital in time, resulting in his death," the police were informed.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound sandbag was pushed behind his back several times while he was trying to reach his goal, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
P. Delta Psi's frat didn't call 911, when Deng passed out, and they were waiting for an hour to get him to the hospital to talk to the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice on how Chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"At that point, the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternization rituals because at least one student dies every year since 1970", said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this is a very important step on the part of the authorities.
The jury in Monroe County was in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a rookie and conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has officially or informally authorized all this, so is it," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood removed the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There's gonna be a raise, and the bull market is gonna trip, the bond returns are gonna grow, and the economy's gonna fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take before the attack, and how long it's gonna take.
Especially for the economy, history doesn't explain much about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first rate increase and for 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US Central Bank administration has so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates, but on how long adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around the rate increases is exaggerated.
"The first raise in the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of cheap money," reported Julian Jessop, the chief international economics specialist at Capital Economics, in his client commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy have responded to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, the expectation of higher rates could lead to volatility for some time.
With the rate up, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It doesn't look like equity revenues are slowing down 12-24 months after the first race, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate increases.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market is more likely to change sharply - about 14 per cent - upward, to remain fairly flat within 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), then to return to normal after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief stock strategy specialist at Nuveen Associate Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate-up stage, and equity revenues begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often helped by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that did not exist before and may accelerate the recession.
For the most part, gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point since the high rate existed.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will last, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
An increase in rates on such a volatile economic background may be risky and raises the question of whether this time will be different, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the Federal Reserve system's rates all year long, with their eyes tied to the meeting of the Open Market Federal Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many policy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve a rate increase at this meeting, futures trade is only 25 per cent likely.
"In our study since 1950, all the cycles of rate increases to date have been in the supercycle of an increasing financial lever, with GDP closing off peaks pre-recession very quickly after recovery," the report states.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession, with a record of 35 months, a total of 74 months and not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expecting higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being implemented for shares.
The fundamental difference is that bonds will have an effect faster than shares when the Federal system changes policy.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, bond returns drop immediately," Deutsche reports.
Policy experts from Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring long-term and short-term bond returns closer, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonds often behave better in this climate, although "we still fear fluctuations in returns," says a study by Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of Federal system policy.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall in inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, with a more flat return curve, credit spreads have increased, and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, with stricter Federal system policies.
Generally speaking, companies that run their main business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts would be in a worse position because the growing dollar made their products more expensive in the world market and their debt more expensive in financial space.
"History shows that "quality" shares are more effective than the market within three months after the initial rate increases," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Companies with stable financial conditions have bypassed unstable companies as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns, as well as low volatility shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality stocks, by an average of 4 (per cent points) and 3 (per cent points) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
High-interest floating-rate companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
The contributors could see profits also through higher returns, although the experts differ in how fast this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM", states the Member of Parliament from the conservatives Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, Andrew Bingham, criticized the station for "downgrading standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less distinguishable from a commercial rival.
He also targeted BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just off the brits.
Damien Collins, a parliamentary colleague who crashed on The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM", said the leader of Parliament, encouraging the television and radio company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
A conservative member of Parliament, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that it seemed as if the public radio station was "deep" and becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- here's two examples that came to my mind, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market -- said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial rival when it came to living music and the formation of an audience.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his loyalty to live performances and music creation isn't really the same as anyone else.
"It's also very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to have been attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A Member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of Pound22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George participate as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wanted the corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time she started a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or to use the money of those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and it could be Black Friday.
There was a 7 per cent increase in online sales during the first three months of 2015
Last month, there was the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago with mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November's Black Friday could help contain spending.
Virtual shopping has been booming for about a decade, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of equalization of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August has shown minimal growth since it began to be recorded in 2000, rising by only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of equalization of online sales after the latest data show only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and come back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehee, IMRG sales index editor.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's on the plateau, and you can see the decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon that came from America is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers, five times the average, rushed to computers to take advantage of favourable offers, thereby destroying a number of vendors' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers engage in a real fight for profit, could force people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over a pound of Pound1 out of every five is spent online.
For goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims bury the dead in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family is subject to sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead through the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the building giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after a crane crash.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets from all over to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the crash of a crane on the main Mosque of Makkah.
Dressed mostly in white, the funeral attendees flooded the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed by a sacred place where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were made available for burial, while King Saudite fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in a crane crash at the main mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, the Grand Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow up when the crane was not functioning.
The Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group bears part of the blame for the collapse.
The English version of the news agency did not reveal this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were not allowed to leave the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the main mosqueyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathering to go to the Hajj this month.
Binlidin Group did not make any statements about the crane collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern safety measures and inappropriate coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the main Mekki Mosque, as part of the large-scale construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family has been one of Saudi Arabia's closest ruling family for decades and has been in charge of major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor son whose family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in heavy winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to take part in the pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in life for every capable Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials have ordered the payment of one million rials (approximately 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount has been permanently injured.
The remaining victims will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the availability of small-money Eastern European workshops
According to Veronica Laurie, British people are increasingly hiring repair workers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country.
Author: Rupert Steiner, Main City Correspondent, Daily Mail
They say the British put the hammer and paint brushes aside, but instead hire qualified Easterners to do the work in the house.
If you can handle the hammer or paint the walls wisely, you seem to be outnumbered these days.
Because, according to the B&Q company, the British are increasingly hiring professional masters to do simple domestic work.
Veronica Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home-building services, reported that this trend is followed by a substantial influx of skilled workers from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen ' s products and simultaneously close 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shop shopping decisions are made by low-sex women.
At present, most of the staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of single-women households, which were more involved in the management of their homes than in the past, could not be ignored.
Ms. Laurie said, "There are still men in our stores.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions to buy goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women in charge of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, has also changed the composition of the top management team to equal numbers of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of managers are women, including the Director General and the Financial Director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification, an important question for us.
It was easy to find suitable women on the board of directors.
After the group took over the cost of shutting down the stores, Kingfisher showed a six-month decline in profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Time of decision on interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, at which a major decision, whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, is discussed within two days.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it will delay and maintain the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalization of interest rates," stated Angel Ubide, a leading employee of the Institute for International Economics, Peterson.
The US economy works efficiently, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but they were convinced that every chance against such a move was against it.
The decision will be announced at 8:00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees enter the EU through Croatia.
Open up! - hundreds of refugees are chanting at the Khorgosh checkpoint on the Serb-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for displaced persons.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the town of Shida on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to proceed without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanović, assures us that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia safe as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help those people to be treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone can do it, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not wish to remain in Serbia.
But the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre fence at the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maymarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
For a number of years, Vangelis Meimarakis was part of the right-wing centrist governments, which, in the view of the left, led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy Party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat, giving way to the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, the New Democracy is equal in popularity.
What has changed in this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
The country is now again facing a fiscal deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors have gone because Mr. Tsipras has driven them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the country's situation in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Day-to-day life has deteriorated markedly since January, when the situation improved, affecting most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that we have learned in recent years that Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no accident that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new premiere on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's European path because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that a country's withdrawal from the EU would have.
Now Europe helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a package of Yunkers, and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras ' negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in its first year wants to be in power, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then, I am sure, all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that as soon as the new agreement is in its first year of operation, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they expect full compliance with the agreement.
If we are to restore their confidence, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must open up to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras Government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Tsipras ministers never talked about it.
That is, Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr. Junker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that before the end of 2014, we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing its sharp corners.
We have moved reform forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary resolve and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then a government majority.
Despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as the mass demonstrations that took place outside.
We were able to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: Recent weeks have seen a massive influx of refugees throughout Greece.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries that these people aspire to?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the government of SIRIZA did not act as it should.
In such matters, we should move ahead, because if the problem hits you, only extraordinary measures remain.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the temporary government that replaced SIRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, assisted by the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will make it possible to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that took place with them.
There is a profound humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maymarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Drykivka Donetsk province, criminal investigation officers of the Central Police Department of the province, together with the military counter-intelligence unit, identified and detained a suspect who was found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from Krivya Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who, the previous night, during a drinking-sharing exercise and a conflict in the village of Yasinovatsk district of Donetchina, fired a machine gun at his opponent.
A report of a 22-year-old boy being injured came from a hospital where he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasicki, Deputy Director of Criminal Investigation at the police headquarters of the province, in the course of operational activities, the law enforcement officers had proved the involvement of the individual in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day, a conflict broke out between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the head of a man.
Criminal proceedings under the articles "Intentional murder" and "Intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm" of the Criminal Code have been opened by the Investigation Division of the DPP.
The detainee faces up to 15 years ' imprisonment.
The Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility and reported to the Donetsk Regional Police Press Service.
Two residents of Novosibirsk who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by a Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
The residents of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons received a 14-month and 18-month restriction on their liberty.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism of the Leninou monuments, which were located on the territory of the CLCF Commune and on the Street of Tricotage, as well as the Memorial of Fame.
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile plant and the T-34 tank were painted.
Remember, on the night of December 12, in the Russian Federation, in Novosibirsk, unknown men painted the Ukrainian flag with military equipment on the MONUment of Fame.
The civilian wife of a popular Russian actor, Eugenia Tsyganov Irin Leonov, gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of Moscow's clinics.
The newborn and her mother are feeling well.
Remember, recently, the Gypsy and Leonov broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina accuses her husband of everything and his ambition.
Eugenia Gypsynov is 36 years old.
He's an actor in Moscow's Petra Fomenko Master's Theatre.
Known from the films "The Walk", "Space as a Premonition", "The Brast Fortress", "The Othepel" and "The Farza".
On 8 September, the Gypsies was recognized as "Acter of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University left an apology note.
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted to "all return", the authorized authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gothier, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police should send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a dog in the house that wouldn't touch anyone, but probably upset.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't give it to me.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body there, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by police, he killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb had anticipated an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday "no information or evidence" of the "love triangle".
About Prentiss was referred to as "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and that she was "inconsolable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, the newspaper San Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lighting, and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say, "He's not going to jail."
On the same evening, when the police hit him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in Pedagogy from the University of Delta in spring 2015.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), experienced several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-standing companion, Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United dropped out for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champion League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the lawyer is worried about this, which will make it impossible to enter the field for at least six months, Louis Van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless ride at the 15th minute, when a 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and provided with oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or a day later and then operated.
It's awful-- a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame a lot of trouble and started playing fantastic, and it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get a red card or a penalty.
An arbitrator, Nikola Rizzoli, did not punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
On his Twitter account, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was."
Also on the theme: Manchester United is experiencing an accident with Luke Shaw in a PSV game.
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious injury."
When any player loses with this kind of trauma, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never our players' intention to hurt the enemy.
Moreno suffered a fracture of his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you don't feel well," said Coke.
I wasn't able to see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like it was touching him, but I didn't see a ride under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear it.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loracs?
Each parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it will take a little while before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Loracs, an environmental fairy tale written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on SuperCamps' website, and goes, "This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always shows some image or message we're missing."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph where Cameron is supposed to recite the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the same-name film made in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In a city surrounded by tall walls, where there was no green or even air for money, a boy named Ted hopes to conquer the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suze (the real name is Theodore Suze Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't look suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the plot of the film "Lorax", posted on Internet Movie Database: "In a city surrounded by high walls, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a recognized active parent, is so unaware of the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by a greedy tree cutter and the knitter of Naifkins, despite Laurax's protests (his name is in the title of the book), a funny creature with a mustache that "spokes on behalf of trees".
It is likely that such a simple PR task was entrusted to the performer, who never read the Laurax book to the child 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text had allegedly been received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments had been received.
For Adam Lith, there was clearly a risk of not joining England's team, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England chose for this tour, repeating the 3-0 test series that happened last time doesn't seem likely to happen.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players among the bats, virtually taking balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only young people's positive.
With the ball, Moin Ali turns into a bowler, kicking the balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack option.
Also on the subject of Adam Lith quit England's test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lith to me, his main coach at Yorkshire, is certainly difficult to analyse.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricket players are evaluated by the judges on the basis of results.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) the players are the best to choose themselves.
The couple were half-shot, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
We hope that if he picks up more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England's team, Trevor Bailiss, spoke well of his attitude, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's first and foremost a team player, and then everything else.
The question is, how long is it gonna be before the batsman of the test cricket gives the impression-- a complicated question.
Lith played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Lithuania was in its best shape, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman I appreciate.
He's the unpredictable cricketist we saw at the Yorkshire Club early this season, when he made 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The thought of putting Moan next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would give us the opportunity to inject an extra spinner by saving four speed bowlers, is thinking, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see any reason why a kicking player can't hit a ball there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a damn good cricket player.
Moan may not be exactly what it takes for his county Woostershire, but it's the third number for them, and there's no big difference.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches "Third Batsman" before he went out as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I spoke briefly with him, he seemed like a very promising young man.
People can look at his rough statistics -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but there's not a lot of votes in favors among spinners, and those who choose youth.
He's gonna learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coach.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the test matches, could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys for a game that's gonna bring in the wealth of experience that's been gained under all possible conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will provide both the energy and the ruthless pace of the Setap.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether it's a game or a coach's job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said, can give new strength to the team.
Collie's teammate, Darem Ben Stokes, is left for one day, Ruth is granted a similar break in connection with Australia, and I don't have a problem with that, for example.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the individuals who select the players do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
Britain's withdrawal camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-advised policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the election of a genius Jeremy-- Is that a yes or a no?-Corbin's Labour Leader or the TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Aliens also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraj.
A friendly European diplomat recently explained that, given the current situation of the EU in a variety of crises - not all of them of its own manufacture - some member countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of disputing concessions and undermining arrangements, which they largely do not want.
Having met in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUK decided that he didn't want them anyway if they destroyed social security.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie program.
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance rides through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, takes pictures of themselves against a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity company, then comes home and says they involve allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining British external contacts under the EU tent, "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, suggests that the stunned ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's most cautious Chancellor, is an ally, but she's been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation gets worse for her, how she got worse for those sitting in her seat, Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrana (14) and Kola (16).
France's head, François Holland, faces re-elections or replacements in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, and Spain may receive a left-wing government.
It's hard to see them sneaking out of their skin to help the "selfi brits" whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK, which they don't want, either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style remarches during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to boost Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "British has received nothing of value from renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what a predator Flit Street can be, and how scepticism toward the EU is about media magnates, unlike Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our introduction in 1973 with a 2:1.
They may be vaguely reminiscent of Boris Johnson, a long-standing Euro-opportunist who was famous for his EU "direct bananas" by a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a flimsy company of tax-afraid crooks, phone hackers, and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair had quite the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a wild gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's referendum idea, because Blair took the lead in favour of a repealed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of that.
But dear Jeremy Corbin, who friendlyly slapped me on my back in Westminster on Monday--I told him he didn't have time to spend any more time on me-- seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnoc's strategy of "Murdock Boycott" from the '80s-- both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy for dealing with the press -- not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, whose couch he was sitting on on on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditional cynicist trend of Ukip and a wider range of "small England's supporters" among Tories may say yes.
It's the same thing that Hilary Benn didn't say on radio and TV this week, and his inner Boy Scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of John McDonnell as a shadowy finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought hard on TV for not being loyal to his colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far or losing his position in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - not exactly what McDonnell said, nor what J.C. said to the pars and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, according to general opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and his "boy" Corbin wanted to say, remember, he touched even me-- the message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7, especially in the vortex of social media, the center of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, letting him take for granted the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main mistake about EU membership - within the "Bennit" sieged fortress economy - is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism caused by minor differences is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson, it is unshakeable that J.K. will not campaign for an exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on British concessions when all this might be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the view of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
A government-funded agency stated that 95 per cent less harmful electronic cigarettes than smoking were heard by 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), together with Lancet, criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
The PHE published an important report, "the milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of evidence".
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the relationship of some experts to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month criticized the "exclusively fragile argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers questioned whether these statements had "hard or fragile grounds".
Martin McKee, a professor of European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: "The fundamental principle of health care - rules must be the basis of proof of effectiveness".
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is taken from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model for multi-criteria analysis of decision-making in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nickel-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates in the health sector in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had previously received from Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of members of the board was not provided, but there are some prominent supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also announced that the industry would be financed in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of tobacco at PHE.
The scientific article published by the group "excellently agrees" that there is a lack of "good evidence of the harmful effects of most products by most criteria" written by McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's statements that "there is no evidence at the moment that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ statements had previously been answered.
He said, "Electroic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two people who smoked all their lives died of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not proven by this evidence, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related diseases, while smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly indicating that, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm caused by smoking, we do our job for the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 thinks BBC should stop the EastEnders show.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give up a lot for a successful show like the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson observed that licensing fees should only be used to create programmes that were not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public broadcasting, which is probably only a fraction of the audience watching, at peak airtime when competitors have a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to cooperate with BBC during his work at Channel 4.
"I can't help but think that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programs that would show competing companies that don't receive subsidies," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee about the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, companies should leave only those programs that aren't produced and aren't going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice's show airs on the prime slot because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else should show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why retrogressive taxes should be used to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give much for it.
I don't understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would somehow downgrade the BBC.
Johnson's serial entrepreneur, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of chasing ratings "because of staff ambition and their belief that it was the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the most popular shows on BBC echo those of Executive Director Sky Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggart lecture in Edinburgh suggested that BBC sell EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the more niche public BBC shows "are continuing to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be argued in the sanctuary sermons that justify the revenue from licensing fees of £4 billion: "Yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible shows that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I encourage you to find a more retrogressive system as to who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think that we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who have 150 pounds of money, I wonder if they think that because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
Former executive director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "information, education and entertainment."
He noted that only a small part of BBC production was now formally classified as educational - he said that it was 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio content - and that the company should capture the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan "inform, educate and entertain".
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "Promenade concerts" (only part of which he said was on TV) as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
"Sonogenics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows nematodes changing direction as they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled using sound wave pulses.
Tiny nematodes change direction at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses too high to be heard by a human ear.
The pulses are influenced by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Also on the topic: Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists said that worms were demonstrating the potential of a new technique called "sonogenics", which consisted of using ultrasound to inject certain brain, heart, and muscle cells, and the source of the ultrasound was located outside the body.
Sricant Chalasani, a researcher at Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematode worms usually do not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles were increasing ultrasonic waves, which then entered the worms.
Stronger ultrasonic waves affect structures called the "ion channels TRP-4" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open up and excite the cells associated with them, as reported in Nature Communications.
To create the nematode that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic changes to worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were reinforced by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activation of modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to that used in "optogenetics", a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right section of the brain on the fibre, low-frequency ultrasonic waves are unobstructed through the body's tissue, so they do not need to go inside the cranial box.
"We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasonic signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin production cells.
The forbidden torture equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Look at the Amnesty International video against the arms show.
Amazing killer drones!
Tibia breakers, iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise sticks that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
There is no doubt that this promotion of the largest international arms exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to push weapons to repressive regimes, using the ExCeL exhibition at the Doclands Center of Defence Technology and Security Systems.

But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters on bus stops and subway trains that require a look at them again.
"An important announcement going through the DLR from September 15 to September 18?" is written on one of them by the London subway fonts showing the DLR line turning into a silhouette tank.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line, and the passengers are asking for help to stop the weapons show.
300 posters are painted by artists who posted their work at the Brutal Design Museum at Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A collection called "Special Patrol" has helped spread them across London using a "advertiser kit", a 6-pound set of wrench keys, which is said to be "accessing about a third of the advertising space at the planet's bus stops".
London's transporters had no fun with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, the curator of the Cruel Designs exhibit and the professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seek to reach out to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists begin to work with activists of protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms show welcoming passengers on the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, a pro bono agency, with graphic designer and voice artist also working for free.
The creative director of the VCCP, Matt Leaver, was struck by the advertising silence around the arms exhibit - with the pass on the Excel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were thinking of creating a more realistic and clever corporate commercial, but "to fill her houses with bright flowers and animation has proved to be more exciting."
"They were incredibly helpful in drawing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of an arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order for AT4CS RS for shoulder shots from the U.S. Army.
It includes a "unexplained cumulative weapon that produces an unbelievable armored effect inside the target".

Eight gold rules for student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to the student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the heavy smiles of those I've been annoying - and the many, long complaints about others.
Mostly what I've learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can range from a little nerve-acting to absolutely scary.
He makes you talk about telling people where you're from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin and why you "honestly, love, or hate "Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHAHA, I'll be in my room."
Take a break.
And help others to rest, too, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking houses, midnight cinemas, and public parties, but they are also a place where people dress and fix their underwear.
Also on: Don't even think about going to university while you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a sanctuary, but many dormitories form a culture of trembling from one room to another that promotes friendship, communication and long-term friendship.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to regain his strength.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy that I've spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is bored with communication - not knocking on him, but sending SMS.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm was following this principle: if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and deliver a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange act, it doesn't look like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I'm gonna ask you personal questions."
Offering home treats is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat would rather make people pretend to sleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but isn't stealing a little milk for tea?
You can handle the milk owner.
He's probably gonna ask you not to be shy, even if it's pissed in the inside.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry, but try to treat it more as an adult than my roommate who poured dishwashing fluid into her milk to get back at those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise that's gonna keep people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're those people from the glass house saying.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to lower the drum and bass guitar sounds because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had an exam this morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then she knocked on her music and locked the door behind her, taking a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband had settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, before you bite your elbows, awkward, if you took your roommate for your future husband, got carried away with him, broke your relationship, and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your mutual friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart, but if the hot roommate isn't exactly your future spouse, try to cool down your own temper a little bit.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the prank and the harassment is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something-- but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you'll put in the freezer, but don't glue other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by using Settings to select General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some encountered problems after installation, when a report of error appeared, telling them that "The application could not be updated".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the recovery subsides or try to update through iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include removing applications to increase the space available - but Apple minimized the probability of the action by reducing the amount of update, and also simplified implementation by means of a special utility that proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after completion of the process.
It is necessary to make sure that your phone is loaded or close to the charger when updating to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because the discharge of the phone during the process may cause a malfunction of the update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a telephone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad had only exacerbated the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writing PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as adversely affecting our common goal of combating extremism — unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict by directly transferring power", the representatives of the United States State Department stated.
They also noted that Kerry had once again stressed the U.S. commitment to the fight against the "Islamic State" in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be a member.
In addition, the US "will welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the "Islamic State".
Last Friday, White House representatives said they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet arrived: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will be beneficial to us, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for Assad's regime as a "loser bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make things worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result the situation worsened -" the President of the United States said.
The imported yacht will be exempt from the payment of customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestym by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Laschkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, on the basis of his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments, namely, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Trans-Russian Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the FSB, the FCS and the Ministry of Tourism, to prepare proposals for the creation of favourable conditions for yachting in the country ' s coastal zones.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about 200 million go to the treasury of European States each year for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of their yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on amending the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties and taxes, which provides for full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for rest and sports.
According to the Ministry, this would certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, noted Lashkin.
The matter was brought before the Subcommission on Customs and Tariffs, Non-Tariff Regulations, and Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and the discussions were also approved by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development had pointed out, the proposed measure of full conditional release on import was inherently a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, Mineconom Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the States members of the EEC, explained to Laschkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for applications in the fields of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for international assistance, among others, service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), test instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious ceremonies.
In the press service of the Ministry of Transport, Izvestym of the Russian Federation, it was reported that it had prepared binding regulations on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provided for simplified procedures for the entry and departure of small, sporting and recreational ships into the port.
The Mintrans instructed the captains of the Crimea Seaports to ensure the application of simplified procedures for the entry of small, sporting and recreational sailing vessels into the seaport and the departure of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the maritime ports of Crimea.
In the case of Yalta and Feodosia, orders had already been issued and the others were in the process of being negotiated, as noted by the press service.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to register small craft for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, the yachting is very difficult precisely because of the poor infrastructure.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a whole growing industry that involves a large number of people.
In fact, in Russia, everything is still in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where yachts can be exploited all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelenjik, Novo Russia, Anapa.
But the big problem is that in this area, the rules of the border guard are very strict: a lot of permits are required to go out on the yacht.
Besides, there's nowhere to fill a boat inside Russia.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then there's a problem where to get it, says Nordmarine Denis Novikov's sales director.
With regard to the yacht storage areas, there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but with the onset of the crisis the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has provided a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"New financing will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", the report states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimayo Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help to revive credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank was witnessing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish Government had previously approved a loan to Ukraine in the amount of 100 million, and handed over the RIA News.
Prisons are asked to set up separate units for transgender people.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Sentences (FISIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of establishing separate units for transgender and transvestites in colonies.
Vladislav Grib, a council member, told the Izvestoms about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-gender convicts in Russia, it was possible to have separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many) in domestic prisons, with a view to creating a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is only after the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations to determine that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a member of the opposite sex that the sentence may be imposed on such isolated places.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice had been successful abroad: SIZO (where the accused were awaiting a court decision) had separate cells for transgender persons and correctional facilities had special units.
Today, it's the only way to deal with such criminals.
They clearly need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for FIN staff.
The humiliation of trances by fellow inmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many sex offenders there are, you have to figure out where to distribute them.
SIZOs are clearly not needed - only cells, cells in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgender people.
The Grib explained that 50 or 100 persons could be held in the unit, and if a specialized corps were to be established in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners would be able to go there from all regions to serve their sentences.
Citizens are held at the remand centre at the place where the crime was committed, so the admission of transvestites or transgender persons from other entities during the investigation and trial is not realistic, but the introduction of such a practice for already convicted persons in a separate colony - yes - is considered by Grib.
It will be recalled that the day before, law enforcement officers were unable to determine to which detention centre, male or female, Dmitri Kozhoukov, a 24-year-old transsexual person (known as Alina Davis), was detained for possession of drugs, and therefore no man with maiden appearance was arrested.
He was released to his home under a no-exit subscription.
This news has been widely discussed on social media and media, as there is no mechanism for the maintenance of transgender people in SIZO and colonies in Rosia.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alexeyev supported the idea of creating special places for the serving of sentences by transgender people, noting that it was also possible to identify people in a colony - male or female - abroad, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just like the issue of ensuring that gays are safe in prisons, Alexei says.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexei doubts whether there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to impersonate themselves as transsexians in order to enter a different colony.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in a transgender colony, but it is not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Menning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change his sex, said Alexeyev.
A man can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that the prison staff will be serious about the safety of such people and will be sensitive to the sensitivity of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the commencement of sentences by convicted persons.
A commission was being set up - it was a question of sexology, and psychiatrists carried out long-term monitoring, which was not the only test on which a high-precision report was based.
Today's psychiatry capabilities make it possible.
Therefore, before changing sex, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they clearly indicate whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is necessary - says Lord Kipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system can be implemented in relation to convicted persons, since on average it takes a month to do this.
The doctor, while generally supporting the idea of establishing separate units for transsexuals, also questions whether it would be appropriate, under the current economic conditions, to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, and transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to count, no official statistics, but considering that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it's possible to say that transgender people are even smaller, and that those who have this deviation and also commit crimes are very few, Lord Kipanidze said.
Currently, at the request of the colony administration, homosexuals and transgender people could receive separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipov won the Junior World Championships.
The World Championship was completed in Hunta Mansijsk until the age of 20.
The end of the first season was more than intrigued.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and became a Russian Michael Antipov, who was able to catch up with the Polesman Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who seemed to have gone to the title with confidence.
For the girls, the victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Books.
The chess world championship held in Hunty Mansysk since the beginning of September, by the middle of the tournament, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as the Polish representative Jan-Kshisztof Duda, who had issued a series of four wins (the competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), had taken a strong lead.
Given that Duda was a top-ranked and considered one of the most promising young chess players in the world, the likelihood that he would miss the break was negligible.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Michael Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained a clear favorite in the title struggle.
After all, the Antipova had to win the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if Duda won his party.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could have affected the game of a Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He was confident with Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for his party to finish Duda's meeting with Benjamin Bock.
Luckily for Antipov, the Polish chess player brought the Dutchman to a draw.
So the Antipov and Duda scored the same number of points -- 10 out of 13 possible, but the AntiPov had the best additional scores.
It was therefore to him that the leadership of the Hunty-Mansian Autonomous Region, whose Governor Natalia Komarov traditionally attached great importance to the development of chess in the region, had awarded a major prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intrigued ending.
The leader of the tournament, Natalie Buxe (Ukraine), was not to lose in the final tournament, which she successfully did.
So the victory of Russian woman Alina Beavol prevented her from catching up with Books.
The Russian athlete was the second woman to lag behind the Championship by a factor of 0.5.
The regional structure is changing with the impel.
The company unites the Volj and Ural regions in one major Volzhsko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East region in the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
Michael Slobodin, CEO of Vimpelcoma, pointed out that changes are being made to "stand by a strong player in the market" and to develop the company "in a new, not always favourable, external environment".
In an interview with Rossia 24, Mr. Slobodin stated that they intended to reduce 10 per cent of the staff in Russia.
Rossimnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volocolam Highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and a facility on Big Tul Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations had been corrected.
Forty-three diners violated the requirements for the accommodation.
Among other violations, poor sanitary and sanitary maintenance of the premises and non-compliance with ventilation requirements were found in some facilities with the bacteria of the intestine group.
The franchise for Burger King's brand is owned by the Burger Rus, owner of Alexander Kolobov's Chocolate Network, and there are 293 diners in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency was opposed to indexing 10 per cent of the freight fares and providing State subsidies as requested by the RZO.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and then they want multibillion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansion, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and on the right.
He added that FAS had its own "more stringent" proposals, which were currently under discussion in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of performing a transaction for a total of $300 million in stock, the gold company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the sumeru stock price and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3rd to implement the option or demand additional payment.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Housing, reported that the Ministry was working with the BC to develop a procedure for the management of developers.
"We understand that there is no escape from this, so a mechanism is being developed," the official said.
Black scripts for Citizen Kane will be tendered.
Representatives of the Profiles in History auction house announced plans to tender draft versions of the film "Civil Kane", which is considered one of the best works of the director, screenwriter and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will start in Calabas on September 29, with three draft scenarios, each estimated at $20-30,000, and the AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final design of the film.
Minpromtorg: Targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
Victor Eutuchov, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the food distribution card system that existed in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic product producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
It should be noted in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the total deficit of the past period, the distribution system, where the quantity of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," TASS quoted Mr. Eutukhov's words.
YO previously wrote that a food card program for the poor had been introduced into the government.
Please read more about the Minpromtorg's initiative in "Igor Shuvalov commissioned the preparation of food cards".
The president of the Roshostrach wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation informed RAPSI that Daniel Hachatorov, President of the Rosgosstrah Insurance Company, had filed a suit with the Moscow Court for the dissolution of a marriage with the designer of Ulyana Sergienko.
The justice of the peace precinct 100 will commence proceedings on 16 September.
Daniel Hachatorov asks for the dissolution of his marriage and the sharing of his property.
The court confirmed the existence of an action for dissolution of the marriage in the proceedings, noting that the claim for division of property had not been and would be brought before the District Court.
President Alexander Bobresov is leaving his post.
The vice president of the USO, Rossian Railways (RZD), on corporate security, Alexander Bobresov, leaves the company, reports Interfax, citing the source.
The Russian Vice-Premier, President of the Board of Directors of the RCD, Arkady Dvorković, stated that the issue of leaving the RCD, Alexander Bobrešov, had been initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Beloser.
According to the Vice-Premier, personnel changes in the management of the RCD are not related to the change of head of the company.
JO previously reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakunin, the RZD led the first Deputy Minister of Transport of Peterburgers, Oleg Belozera, who supervised the financial block.
The new head of the company first announced monopoly reforms: a new system of freight tariffs will be established within a year and a half.

This year's study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is released for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian managers in a year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year ' s ratings.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is requested to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would be useful to add to the pool of candidates.
The following company functional directors may be nominated: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, IT director, public and corporate relations director, government director, corporate governance director.
Each expert-proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his/her management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The sectoral nomination of candidates is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry, engineering, media, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer services and production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, finance, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a log and password for access to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information on the remaining participants and can present their estimates on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the "Best Choice" principle: top managers rate top managers, functional managers rate functional managers.
This principle allows for the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
Final ratings are approved by expert commission meetings.
The face-to-face meetings of expert commissions are open to all interested candidates for this year ' s ratings and multiple candidates for past ratings.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions to approve functional managers.
At expert commission meetings, it is proposed that the lists submitted be approved in alphabetical order (places retained strictly according to the web-based assessment and closed information prior to the publication of the rating) or that updates be made in accordance with the attached roster of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of the JO.
At the time of the publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfort rate for an investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the credit market for small and medium-sized businesses was 40 per cent over the period January-April of this year.
What is your estimate of the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, lending to HCMs declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
The 25-30% annual loan was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank could have put all its possible problems at a higher rate in the future, ranging from delays to non-refunds, it is not possible to do so now: the stakes are already cloudy.
For business, the current level of interest rates on HCMs is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in terms of return.
The rate level of 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and create attractive returns.
How far do you estimate that business demand for credit is being met?
After the BC's interest rate fell, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients have become much less likely to apply for loans.
In the first place, business does not understand its development prospects and future revenues.
Today, business has one option: it is necessary to learn how to deal with today ' s economic situation in the country and region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely and to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows a company to make its products more competitive and to maintain business even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the HCMs lending market that will strengthen and influence its development before the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The projected reduction in the average rate will depend to a large extent on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator is now showing consistency in the reduction of the key rate.
However, there is no need to wait for a radical drop in the loan price for the HCMs.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem that makes the higher interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the BEC's rates are reduced.
In terms of the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, which are limited both in their ability to replenish and in their options to correct economic behaviour, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written with Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time difficult for those who are accustomed to cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other brand model: without elegance, attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
The Japanese, simply because of their Japaneseness, are able to bring the attachment to the products of the rising sun country to a state of total delight.
You can argue for cars from other countries as much as you want, and a man can even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will spread out from the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people probably have to love not only technology, but everything else in Japan.
Quoting with Base, fixing Wasabi's food, collecting katanes, and dressing your girlfriend, no, not in kimono, of course, but by the canons of Japanese street fashion: nice, creative, and quite unexpected.
Japan's uniform, I think, is the only uniform girls wear with pleasure after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the new pattern of headlights and rearlights, which immediately recognize the car in the car stream, changes the shape of the car much more.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks quite seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the appearance is strict.
You don't have to call the police.
In driving CX-5, one of the most secure in the world, only Stoic Japanese calm can be felt.
A 2.2 l diesel engine provides a high torque over a wide range of speeds.
The fuel consumption of this motor, with a total capacity of 175 litres, is 5.9 litres. The powertrain is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and a full drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a Prince from the Not Cross police tape.
At Mazda, however, every effort has been made to prevent you from driving CX-5 at the scene of your own accident.
In order to further improve comfort while maintaining excellent control, the suspension was re-engineered to the front and rear amortizers and optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The high speed noise level of the road and engine is reduced by 13 per cent.
A flower- or strip-bowler is as bored as a budget sedan.
It's different if the girl's wearing a bathing suit with an original drawing.
Like a role-player computer game.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, which provides the optimum reserve of space for both broad shoulders and long legs - who has what.
The long legs will surely appreciate that the sticks at the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the windows.
The widest range of Mazda active security systems is proposed on CX-5.
Radios, lasers and cameras are used to detect potential threats.
There's both adaptive lighting and lane alerts, and monitoring of dead zones and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in class.
It is comfortable, having a minimum projection, and includes a load of 561 litres. Rear seats are folded into a 4:2:4 ratio, each section being equipped with a separate bulwark and increasing the luggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The costume of a cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi."
It's particularly good-looking, pajama kigurum.
There's nothing in it!
Sure, sleep.
But also, entertaining little children.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
'Cause it's so great to be able to choose -- funny clothes, manner of behavior, or car.
Thank you for helping me prepare the material for the Kawaicat store.
Kiev ripped off the atomic nuclei.
Kiev officially announced Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia in the construction of the Khmelnitska nuclear power plant.
On Wednesday, after a second attempt, the Verkhovna Rada voted to cancel the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks had been signed as far back as 2010-2012, but it had not been possible to proceed with the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a law terminating an agreement with the Russian Federation between 2010 and 2012 to build a third and fourth block on the Khmelnitska nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the Government had been passed only by a second vote, with 210 deputies supporting it for the first time, with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The original Soviet-owned Hmelnitsky nuclear power plant was to have four power units of 1 GWW with VRE reactors, but only two had been built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the construction had led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012, Rada passed relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in Ukraine ' s budget, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on a loan from the Russian side, but no funds had been made available.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing a refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnica nuclear power plant and on the project for the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained was the purchase of fuel from the Russian Federation for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (about half of the country's electricity generation), as so far Ukrainian ANCEC's "Energy" has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
The plans for the completion of the Khmelnitska nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as early as 2014, talks with Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev.
The UN Genssex is opposed to the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," gives the AP his answer to the question about Syria's military support from Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, Deputy Chief of the Russian Armed Forces, reported that the General Staff did not rule out the possibility of establishing an air force base in Syria in the future.
There's no such plan yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
JO previously reported that the US did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat Russia's banned terrorist group, the Islamic State.
For more information about US doubts about Syria's Russian aid, read the material entitled "Rossian Military Presence in Syria Concerned Washington".
In the PA, OSCE reports on a possible meeting between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-east Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," quoted TASS as Mr. Gerasimov's words.
He also called for the implementation of the Mine Agreements and "return to normal life in our countries".
On the question of whether it was possible, in his view, to hold a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, either in the "Marand format" or in the form of a contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasimov observed that the dialogue had taken place, there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, all kinds of dialogue are supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, Leonid Kuchma, ex-President of Ukraine, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk Republics had not changed their positions in the tripartite talks in principle, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties have been given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission took stock of the city's municipal district elections by assigning 12 parliamentary mandates, which were drawn from party lists.
Traditionally, there have been many complaints of election irregularities from representatives of the CDF who accused the "falsification" of being a racket.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the Communist Party of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the abolition of the cost of renovating multi-family homes.
The city bark officially presented the results of the elections to the proud Lower Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the voters ' rolls in Lower Novgorod, 746.7 thousand votes were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "One Russia", six deputies are proud of Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasilia Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rastyaev and Igor on the Mount.
The only mandate of LDPR was given to the leader of the party, Vladimir Girinovsky.
The two mandates of the CLCF are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of the State Duma, Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of Justice Russia are given to Alexander of reason, Igor Bogdanov and Michael Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they will be elected members of the city house: if they relinquish their mandate, they will proceed to the next candidate on the list.
The President of the Gorizbircom, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he was on duty "to send telegrams to Girinovsky and others" for the withdrawal of mandates.
At the time of the adoption of the electoral protocol, representatives of CLCF stated that there were numerous irregularities.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the Gorizbirkom with a consultative vote from CLCF, proposed not to recognize the results of the voting in the four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, by order of the head of the Sormov district administration, the entrance to the administration building, where the four county commissions were located, had been closed.
Neither the Udma deputies nor the candidates themselves nor the observers could go through the inside for a long time, and the high-profile incident of storming the doors of the Rai Administration was shown on television.
All observers and panel members were able to attend district commission meetings with the right to a consultative vote.
They were denied access by the head only when the ballot had ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballots.
This was done to prevent different provocations.
"The chapter was then corrected, and all the meetings were attended by interested persons", a member of the mountains of Natalian Andrušin's beer.
Communists objected to the fact that for more than four hours in a blocked administration building, a deputy of the Zak meeting in Ludmila Aristau had been illegally detained and a statement had been sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that in a number of UIRs on election day the urns began to be sealed at 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. on the ballot papers.
However, the members of the consultative and observer commissions had not been notified, so they had arrived at the start of the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that the ballot papers could be uncontrollably cast into the ballot boxes in the morning prior to the opening of polling stations.
However, the mountains, which had already examined more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the casts of the unrecorded ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from Justice Russia, Maria Popova, to go through the olyslimbirk, with amendments to regional legislation, in order to establish clearly the time for the opening of envelopes with early ballots, which then enter the urn.
"As your own initiative, at least address the CEC," said Ms. Popova Alexander Maquia.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman was met with high-profile accusations by CLCF member Sergei Samhin, who cried out that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered up electoral fraud.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful!" "The chairman of the barquor is offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the draft must approve the overall results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the 6th Lower Novgorod city Duma will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission refused the political party Communists of Russia to register an initiative group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the discussion of the lower city: whether they agreed that the cost of renovating multi-family houses should be "immediately eliminated" and the tariffs on residential and communal services "freeze until 2020".
However, the lawyer of Irin Maslova's mind explained that the appeal by the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx is a mixed product, with a decrease in projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares were shared by about 2.5 per cent in pre-tenders 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that she was planning to earn $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is declining despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in charges for heavy or bulk cargo by land, which will begin in November.
The company stated that it continued to plan to increase revenues over the previous year through reduced expenditure, increased gross income and increased online trade.
The Chairman and the CoO, Fred Smith, stated that the company had been "stable in terms of weak economic conditions compared to the forecast, especially in production and world trade".
Employment plans for the holidays were announced the day after the competition, UPS, announced that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as they were hired last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous year.
The return on the action was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per action conducted by the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a recession in the international emergency transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the online shopping boom dramatically improved the results of the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating revenues remained largely unchanged due to increased costs of large-scale shipping and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned a higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher labour costs.
In the pre-tenders, about an hour before the FedEx stock market opened, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, dropping 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, the Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from a Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end, a richly decorated meeting room two floors above them will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must put the country's economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double assignment from Congress: to maximize employment in the US and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the federal system have recognized that there is a third, unwritten assignment: financial stability.
And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the almost predictable decision that will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is prepared to break free from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong economic growth, recent shocks in the world financial markets can deter the already cautious leaders of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the federal foundation rate by only a quarter of a point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegsa, chief economist of the brokering company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she noticed.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself causes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to stay away from this, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent probability of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the stake, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the impact of the promise that the next increase will not be forthcoming.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the policy makers of the federal system would leave the bet this week, said John Lonsky, the chief economist of the Moody's Capital Market Research group.
"It would be a surprise if the federal system raised the stakes at that point in time," he noticed.
If the Federal Reserve leadership does that, "they will have to go a long way in adopting their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints by liberals that greater economic progress was needed.
Although the growth of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal system.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to fall below the central bank ' s annual target of 2 per cent, the Federal system stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of the oil price collapse.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the decline in the labour market," observed Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow Jones index for industrial company shares fell by 16% of the relatively high figure in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy might slow global growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the May high.
For the management of the Federal Reserve system, market outrage adds to the difficulty of calculating the timing of interest rate increases.
"In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and news of China's weak economy in the last few weeks, they would have been turning the nuts at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliver, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, according to his projections, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about the implications for the American economy, and they have little or no reliable data after the recent events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy was not a major concern of the Federal system and should not be taken into account in making those decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become a world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Just a hint from the then President, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Federal Reserve could "shuffle" its monetary expansion has caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, "Quicker art than science", noted Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been excessive reactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic principles".
Laker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three sessions, "despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US", Laker said.
One year later, the leaders of the Federal system lifted these cuts.
The Federal Reserve system should be given the highest priority to concern for stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England interest-rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're scared of rising rates because markets are going through shock," said Pozen, president of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should go ahead.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
The common name of the Thai Costco, LAX-C, is the wholesale Thai market, which also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/storage is a store where all can be bought at once, offering a dizzy choice of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious orchards and festive ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy oil for the engine.
The store is huge, and it's gonna take more than an hour to comb through all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking department in the store (good and cheap) is located near the cashier's office and offers various options for taking out.
Anything you need, anything, Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include delicacy Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits, and many others.
The meat counter is diverse, like the fish counter, the staff behind the counter will clean and smash the fish, and even fry it for you if you want.
A good part of the store is placed under an impressive freezer, where you find frozen leaves of curry, bitter pumpkin and galangal, ducks all over, fish, beef and bile, pig carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-finisheds, and so on.
Who buys it: owners and chefs of restaurants, and families and individual buyers.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in the wide passageway.
New dourian montong near the exit.
Where it is: The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the edge of the Chinese quarter and the business center of the city, a few blocks from Philip The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site that it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, it's usually easy to find a parking lot.
The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East to allow refugee waves to flow to Europe.
As Interfax conveys, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not an advocate of conspiracy theories, but the question is whether Europe is not the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic persistence in recent years, have destabilized the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?" he asked.
"I'm sure someone thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who were fleeing death, would go to the prosperous countries of the EU," he added.
Naryshkin asked, "How many political leaders in Europe have spoken out frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally gripping their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO is flouting many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe has, unfortunately, long and impartially watched and watched as the military boot built according to NATO standards melts down the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," the speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal militias are opposed by rebels, mostly of Islamists.
Later, an Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The United States supports both Assad and IG rebels.
Official Damascus regards such rebels as terrorists.
The President of Syria cited the West's hostility to Russia as a cause.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad in interviews with RT, Channel One, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin "returned from a friend of the West to an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected through democratic elections recognized in the West".
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the "Islamic State".
Commenting on the West ' s constant claim that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if so, at the request of the people, not by a decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, or else he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was ongoing with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He denied that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"It is true that there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place," he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Egyptian coalition led by the United States," Assad pointed out.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was occupied by the terrorist group Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition has air strikes at IG positions.

Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
There are 650 teams involved in search and rescue.

Laurov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Policy: Peace: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters report this with reference to the representative of the State Department, John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
In doing so, he stated that the US had the tools for "the further isolation of Russia" if it supported Syrian President Bashar Assad and handed over RIA Newsti.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a conversation with Kerry, Lavrov once again stressed the need to create a unified front against terrorist groups operating in that country.
Ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Previously, American officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the increase in Moscow ' s support for Assad.
In Washington, they said that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President Dmitri Peskov's press secretary stated that the country would not enter international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was occupied by the terrorist organization Islamic State.
The U.S.-led international coalition is attacking IG positions with air strikes.
The beard called the information of the American newspaper a slander against the Arrow.
Alexander Boroday, former President of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
This was reported in a telephone interview with the correspondent Lenta.ru.
The note at Washington Post is beautiful because it's totally fucked up.
The former DNR Minister of Defence, Igor Strelkov, naturally did not bind and "draw out" him from the territory of the Republics of Donbas in a very high mood, without ropes, without three truckloads of money attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Berodai, the talk about Arrow was actually going on with a reporter in the U.S. newspaper.
"Yeah, I said that Strelkova urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former Head of Government of the DNR.
Bearody pointed out that he did not know why a reporter in an American publication had decided to write that the Arrows had been taken to Russian territory "involved".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is incredibly misunderstood words, because I stressed that the Arrows were leaving themselves," Beardai observed.
"It's slander against me and the Arrow," he concluded.
Previously on The Washington Post, there was an article that quoted Borodaya's words that he had forcibly taken the Arrow into Russian territory.
According to the publication, Borodaj noted that he had to tie up his associate.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish lumberjacks began cutting trees over an underground tunnel, where a train with the gold of the Third Reich is reported to be located.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, with Reuters reporting.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the credibility of rumours about the treasured train.
There may also be valuable minerals inside the train.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Nizhnesilez voivodeship Tomash Smolarsch (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that new evidence of the existence of a train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to block the search area.
Three days earlier, the Polish Deputy Minister of Culture, Petr Zhukhovsky, had stated that local treasure detectors had "99 per cent probability" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels discovered, they would become the property of the State Treasury, and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Walbzhih to report that they had found a train in a closed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Russian main drug dealer proposed that the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age should be prohibited.
Russia's main drug dealer has proposed a ban on the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that, until then, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful".
He said that on live television, "Mosqua" radio station, commenting on information that Speaker Sovfed Valentina Matvienko had supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
The human condition is not evenly ripe.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for it.
Mentally, he's been ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is well known from the scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only ripe for 21 years," Brun noted.
In the past, Sultan Hamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the project "Treat Russia", had informed the Izvestym that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age of the sale of alcohol and had "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the issue again at the site of the Upper House of Parliament".
According to the activist, a working group would soon be set up within the Federation Council to draft a draft law under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Child Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible's compliance with the Federal Act on the Protection of Children from Information harmful to their Health and Development, which was read by Cib.fm's correspondent on 16 September.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he purchased a Bible from the Chitai City store on the Red Notice, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that he believed violated the FL "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development".
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
A response from a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself," the complainant commented to Sib.fm.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that's gonna stir up society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which it has never done before.
Brazilian Union of Paediatricians Rio Grandi promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method by which it is intended to convince women to eat fully during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of infants sucking breasts, written with images of harmful food.
Breastmilk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbs, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant women and women who have given birth are encouraged to increase the daily calorie intake rate by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that increasing calories alone is not the only dietary change that mothers must make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affected the expression of genes in children and prevented them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy diets on the immune system of the child have been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train sank the school bus.
In the vicinity of Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of them.
He was filmed by one of the students.
The emergency caused panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was hit by a miracle except for one passenger of a train who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
The doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for the prohibition of boxing in the country after the death of a local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a match with a Filipino named Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category of 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali's knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support machine.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in a draw.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second time that Australian boxers have lost their lives in the past six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, in her view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is not happening intentionally," said Stephen Parnis, Vice President.
But as boxing now exists, there will always be situations where the athlete is hemorrhaging or brain injury, leading to either death or severe damage.
For that reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergei Naryshkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
That was what he said when he addressed the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable action, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"This should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on OSCE PA participants to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's put morality back into politics.
Let us restore dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"Double never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiation and the immediate convening of our inter-Parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"It's almost the only common area where we're still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," stressed the politician.
It will be recalled that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar, and will continue until 18 September.
Enjoyed the victory for a few or three days.
World Athlete Champion Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be described as a triumphant season for a 24-year-old light athlete from Barnaul Sergei SUBENOV.
He was able to win the European team leader's 110-metre-long coronary, set several records, and most importantly become the world champion, the first in the history of a domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the sportsman recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, ranking third in total.
The New Izves asked Shubnkov to share the impressions of the off-season.
Sergei, isn't the season over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna play the World War Games in October in Korea, and then I'm gonna be thinking about rest.
It's true, I'm going to be preparing at home in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different state.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a beautiful time.
The passion after the season's main start has been cast off, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
It's a pleasure fight, relaxing.
Plus, you know, vacation's gonna be...
Are you tired?
After all, it's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness by the end of the season always accumulates.
It doesn't matter what he did more - win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, moving, all of this doesn't go away for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But right now, I've got emotions on the rise.
What's going on? I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the Beijing World Cup, do you come back often?
It happens.
You're not letting me forget about it, are you, reporters?
But in general, I think it's bad for an athlete who lives in old wins to run his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed winning a few or three days, and we need to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at a meeting, then back at home.
It's the usual.
But with the coach, the challenge is to try to get to a new level I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of sneakers, did a whole physical training exercise, which included both traction and a squat, and we pumped our backs.
Then they went into barrier training, and they did a lot of technical work.
Have you ever been followed by a rival?
I always try to do that, the good in the Internet age isn't a problem.
I watched the European Winter Championship and the French took the pedestal in a barrier sprint!
I thought I'd do something about this company.
With every start you've made this season, you've added and added to the results.
Did that make you feel any better?
I've got all these last seasons going around the same pattern.
There's no way I run 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always spin my shape gradually.
What I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All work was focused on this result.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel like you're ready to do something, and it doesn't always work out in competitions.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, tried to forget that semi-final race.
It was really good, really could've run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had repeated my best result at the time, I'd have been a bronze winner of the Games.
But not lucky.
Remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at that time, and it was such a maximum program.
And fell off the morning, in the preliminary races.
That's when I realized that tearing up and carrying my head wasn't going anywhere.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he finished his finals with a better time.
I remember my senses well before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold!
How can you not lose your head by developing a decent speed without turning it off?
This is the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't push barriers.
I've noticed that when you're leaning on a process rather than a result, it's much easier.
And the hottest thing is when you get the feeling you're running and it's like you're doing it all the time!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the interior, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
Haven't you ever thought like that?
It's still better at home.
I have no idea where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better terms, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
How long have you been together with Charming?
Since he was 12 years old, since he came to the athlete.
I mean, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, and then I jumped three ways.
The kid's beef was-- it's when they throw the ball, jump in the length of the place...
He tried the barrier run at 14 and I liked it.
Since the first race, the second adult rule has been met.
I did.
There's never been a fear of the barriers?
One day, I had to make a deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work to do on technology.
There's a race you've been going through!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The tech needs to do it all the time, so I can wake up at night, get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my runs, but I couldn't help myself.
But efficiency needs to be further worked out - there is no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid that winning the year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
If you've chosen this road, you have to go all the way.
My coach likes to say that if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are pissed off, I know they don't eat bread. Let me give you a lift.
And even though I didn't put my flag around, and the same thing, a million times I talked here, and I didn't call anyone a direct bastard, I got hit by another one.
All my pseudo-friends disappeared in a second.
The press that I'm going through is so strong that even I, who's seen a lot of guys, I think people are full of blends.
It's like walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a crowd and muzzling with sticks.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, I'm scared.
The other case is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And only assholes can get passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimean events in a dramatic way:
What you did to the Crimean peninsula was a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Chrushchev tried to sign something never fits into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It's like going to a neighbor's house and picking up his apartment...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I'm pretty sure, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard in the Kremlin.
I have any idea who it might have been...
Cobson doesn't have much left to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they destroyed his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting their little homeland.
And reconciliation now rests only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads the ratings despite the Ninth's attempts to highlight the leaders' losses at Today Show.
Carl Stefanovich's and Lisa Wilkinson's retreat to Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement of the liberation of the leader's seat was not able to raise Today's rating significantly.
The 9th morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat by Tony Abbott.
The contestant, Sunrise, with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture did not seem to matter much for Australian television viewers, with a Sunrise audience of 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly more than it did on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 in Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
An important news for Seventh was the amazing 800 Words debut with the former star of the Packed to the Rafters series, Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a popular show alone, without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud yes.
The X Factor Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
The seventh was mixed with luck and failure on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.) of Andrew O'Keefi's new television set gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyre (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half of an hour, the second half of an hour, containing 720,000 spectators.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's second night ratings will make Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay McGuyre's show.

The three finalists are unanimous in that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he gonna pick?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snowman Markosky may have accidentally made it clear which one of them is going to win the "Wolf."
The woman that Sam Wood's gonna end up with in the Single is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the finals, of course, remain silent about which one received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snowman Marcoski, and Lana Jewons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls were to be left, they might have given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the end of Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling us why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, and joy as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, in their answers to the question, "If not you, then who should receive the last rose of Wood?", they may have been reluctant to tell us which one of them actually won the heart of the Folly.
Jevons-Fellows and Markosky no doubt called Mackay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I became a member, I felt Sam's energy and energy, and I knew they were very good for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jewons-Fellows.
"Sara's a very open man, she's easy and funny," Markoski added.
I saw them together, there's a real attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McCoy thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
Mackay herself said that, thanks to her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be the "the same person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized it was definitely more than just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she said.
To the question of who Voodoo should choose, if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snowman and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor's show is released on Wednesdays at 7:30 on the Ten channel.
Initially published as "Sara - Sam Wood's Best Choice?"
Jarrid Hayne had several career options at the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seemed like a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would have left Hain on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed at the first pant return in a win-win game with Minnesota with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to get the pant back, and also got him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was good after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of delivering to the new recruits in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter of the 49ers club Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from Thomas McGoy, coordinator of special teams, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball at the return of the pant by the Minnesota Wykings team during the first quarter
That's the beginning of NHL Hain's debut and his many Australian fans clearly didn't count on it.
You could see Hayne fighting from the field after losing the ball, and then he told the host of the Hamish and Andy show at 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a more unsuccessful start to a career at the NFL.
"This happens, you just think about the next game and that's it," said Hain.
Heyne compared his failure to his debut in the 2007 Origin game series, when the ball shot in his credit zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hain took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of the use of weapons at Siberian airport.
In an open call to President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were interrupted.
At the Hungarian border, there had been clashes between migrants and the police.
The refugees staged protests at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, and handed over Reuters.
Migrants threw stones at police officers and tried to tear down a fence on the border.
The scene of the clashes is reinforced and the police respond to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serb-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reporting to the BBC.
The country ' s authorities had allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them to the country in question.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers had been injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of the State borders, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally and the accelerated procedure for processing asylum requests.
A Hungarian court had already found a migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer of border security functions to the Hungarian armed forces in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km barbed wire fence at the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
Russian confessed to the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
The accused of the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States, Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reporting to Reuters.
During the trial before the New Jersey Federal Court, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the session, a Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyber attacks against 15 companies.
The cumulative damage to the defendants was estimated at $300 million.
"These defendants, like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a million-dollar fine.
When sentencing, the court will take Russian confessions into account and may reduce the sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be pronounced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smilian, was taken into custody.
The last crime he was charged with denied his guilt.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia's support of the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russian support for Syrian President Bashar Assad had exacerbated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad runs the risk of exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal to combat extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," says a report published on the United States Department of State website.
Kerry confirmed the U.S.'s commitment to fight the Islamic State (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the Syrian conflict could be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
The day before, the White House spokesperson Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic State".
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian territory.
In response, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians to acquire technology to use it against Islamists.
Four died when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police began firing rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, as the spokesman stated on Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians had been injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be lethal but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, lowland part of Nepal, where the Madezi people claim that the new provinces formed under the new Constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru citizens who want to have a state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that took the lives of thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials announced that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as the centre of the chemical industry, and has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the correspondent of the "Provincial".
Oleg Valerjevic, where did you start your job as mayor?
First of all, I reviewed the results of the financial and economic audits and initiated an independent audit of the local budget.
An audit of municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the turnover of documents to five days.
Previously, paperwork could have been running for months.
Activities to improve the income base and optimize costs have been developed.
Last November, a government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
The town had no design and design documents (PPA) for any site.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of POJA for roads, kindergarten, northern sewers and a watercourse.
Roadwork is already under way in two sections.
How is the Russian President's decree on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
The city has not seen such positive demographics in the past 27 years.
So the issue of day care is one of the most pressing ones today.
Since 1 September, a total of 320 places have been closed for major repairs to kindergarten No. 10.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
In the past year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 opened, which now has 200 children.
The renovations were co-financed from the regional and local budgets, at a cost of more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the Regional Government, funds had been made available for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" programme had also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have a three- to seven-year-old.
Investors show interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be carried out, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, and that they are the ones that need to be put to work.
As early as October, a 60-house home for orphans in the Leningrad district is being set up.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya that has been included in the economy-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
In all, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme.
One condition is that housing should not exceed 30,000 rubles per square metre, which includes turning-keying.
If we can keep up with the numbers, we'll continue to participate in the program.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, the Sayan Pornocomplex was built on the Territory and sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the D.A.'s office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the target is federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, and 88 hectares are to be transferred to regional property, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the 1.5 billion roubles project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be of great help to the city.
Is Sayansk a well-established social partnership institute?
We have about 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
A large number of projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Companies such as the East Centre, the New Ziming CHP, the Sayan Broiler, the PK MDF, are providing tangible support and the management of these enterprises is responding to all requests.
On the eve of the Day of the City of Saiyan Broiler gave the city a children's town, and East Centre repaired the horseyard, where specialists worked with children in the ipatherapy industry, spending more than 1 million roubles.
Thanks to sponsorship, the city register has been improved.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city's day with beauty.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
The city's book, a book of Sayan poets, was released.
Prominent medals have been awarded to pioneers and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk.
They also participate in the work of the urban charity.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been devoted to supporting talented children, helping children in need of expensive treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and subject teachers in the city.
Housing for professionals is essential to address the human resource issue.
Over the past year, we have set aside five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have received office accommodation.
We have a housing program that can privatize it in five years.
The plans are to remodel the building, which will have eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the programme "Housing for the Russian Family".
In the long run, construction of a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a functioning team in the city that I can handle the most difficult issues with.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A bill has been introduced in the Duma on the indexation of social benefits in the light of price increases.
A bill has been submitted to the State with a view to indexing social pensions annually from 1 February to take into account price increases.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rumyans, deputy of Justice Russia, also proposes to carry out a further indexation of pensions on 1 April if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
In accordance with the legislation in force, social assistance is indexed annually from 1 April to take into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced into the lower house provides for the introduction of social pensions indexation to take account of the rate of consumer price growth.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February and the second to 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogerini that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In an official letter to the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogerini, the OSCE PA Speaker, Ilkka Canerva, declared that sanctions against legislators participating in assembly events were unacceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Cyprus, Germany, France, Italy and Greece, were collected in support of the Canerva position.
"There's already quite a lot of support," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to gather signatures from deputies who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Canerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing structures and to "send a petition".
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Mouse Islands is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low-pressure area, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands, is likely to have 60 per cent of the turn into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Another well-defined area of low pressure around the middle between the Green Moss Islands and the Small Antilles is also 60 per cent likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports the Miami synoptics.
Google is launching a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European-populated refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-traditional personal approach by announcing a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of being made by one of the leaders, a Google employee, Rita Masud, who ran away with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We've been driving shady trains and buses, starving, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
The donations will be made to four non-profit organizations involved in refugee and migrant assistance: Médecins sans frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google announced that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on Google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with slight obesity can be helped by obesity surgery.
The positive effect of obesity surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with slight obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Death statistics do not appear immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote about a new study in the column of JAMA Survey editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of organizations to absorb food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major research has been done among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
The MTI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
IMT 25 or higher indicates that a person has excess weight, and people with IMTs above 30 are considered obese people.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypassing and sleeve gastroctomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment for people with slight obesity.
The average IMT for those who were surgically involved fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of participation in the study.
At the same time, the IMT for those who received non-surgery treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Of those who had undergone surgery, 36 per cent had been completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group that received medical treatment, for comparison, only 1% were treated for diabetes, and only about 2% were treated for diabetes.
Moreover, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" PLPP cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group", the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better held below 7%, says researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin level A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8 per cent.
But the best glycemia monitoring indicators, reflected in good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo's research manager and colleagues.
The study team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that had a sleeve gastroectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg compared to 14.2 kg), achieved a higher reduction in the IMT (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to longer life expectancy, as Blackstone from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona, reports.
According to a Swedish study of obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower than the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with IMTs below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report here is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low IMTs where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease", she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT reaches between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they develop the genetic changes that lead to obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In the Mouses, the muggers took out the coats and 9 million rubles from the house.
In the Mouses, the robbers attacked the residents of the subway house and stole 9 million rubles and three women ' s coats.
Interfax informs of this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns entered the house on Gorkogo Street through an open front door, bound the 20-year-old son of the housewife and, threatening both with a knife, abducted 9 million roubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the article "Rasbo".
The fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petrenburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will be visiting the World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not yet in a hurry to obtain permission.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to the World Celebrity, the authorities will have to come up with ways to resettle all the guests of the city.
Rosballat's interviewees believe that the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the rental tournament, the cost of rental housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup made the authorities pay attention to the state of the Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically for the first year, every hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that this will not be possible for everyone: the hotels are so afraid of the checks that they often do not even send the documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service in Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to file 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopolists.
There are indications that the top three dozen companies have lied to citizens by posting a number of stars in advertising, and Vladimirov has pointed out.
The problem is, right now, there's literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football tournament the fans will take over all the Petrenburg hotels.
There are now 30,500 numbers available for tourists in the city.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five - star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four - star hotels, 100 - two - and three - star hotels, and 550 - single - star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, Nana Govichia, only 23 hotels have been classified so far - so many inspections have been carried out by companies accredited in Petersburg.
In fact, if a hotel ordered a similar procedure from a regional enterprise, it was not known to the Smooth in a surprising way.
I mean, there may be more than that, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months the hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification," admitted the director of the Northwest Division of the Russian Union of Tourism, Yekaterina Shadsky.
This is due to the high season in which hotels earn the most money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is budgets that have not included audit costs, and the procedure may be costed to the hotel depending on the status of between 30 and 100,000 roubles or more.
However, hotel managers have recently stepped up and applied for classification, assuring Shadsky.
The hotels will have to make it by 1 July 2016, otherwise not only will they pay a fine, they won't even be eligible for the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed for the tournament.
The formulas on which the value will be calculated will be made public next year.
This was done to prevent the price rise of 200-300 per cent, as was the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and avoid a double-three-fold promotion, but you have to let the hotels make a living.
"I think it's up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not convinced that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much that fits into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than unbridled growth," he said.
It's not clear what's gonna happen to the popular cheap hostels.
The deputies of the State Duma have introduced a bill to prohibit hostels in homes.
We very much hope that the law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels must be preserved," Nana Gwachia says.
However, she said that the owners of mini-feds should in any event be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma did approve the bill, about 80 per cent of the hostess would be closed in Petersburg, and there were currently 1,500 numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotelists of Northwest Leonid Garbar, there are two- and three-star hotels in Petersburg that are just wanted by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation where "75,000 vips sit in the 80,000th stadium".
It can be fixed by mini-fingers.
Their possible ban, the expert thinks it's "idiotic," "I think it's weird that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason the visitors can't."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel that guests come to for short periods, why not?
Mini-Hotels are running the risk of missing the World Cup because of their lack of speed.
Hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to pass the classification, and they're digging themselves.
By summer 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
"Companies that can do this procedure are not many, so they will refuse less paid mini-hotel orders, but will choose those that are more expensive," observed Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the results of the checks have so far been considerably higher than those of Peterburg.
The reason for the delay in Peterburg is related, inter alia, to permanent relocations in the government tourist block, which does not facilitate smooth work.
According to the experts, if the Petrenburg hotels are not enough, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to the regional hotels and recreation homes.
Like the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg in the city, the river fleet can be mobilized, i.e. the tournament's guests can live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be ready to arrive in vans where they can spend the night.
"The main thing isn't to set up so many hotels that they're empty," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
A rental home will also be popular during the football championship.
Most likely there will be a reserve of rental apartments in the city.
Rent rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious--the first house to go near the stadium," noted Larissa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Agency for Development and Research.
The rent may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed, would also contribute to this.
Nor should we forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a welcoming city in which people not only point the way, but can also conduct a mini tour.
There are complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk in 1970, a father, a mother and two children.
They didn't have a place to spend the night, and it was hard to sleep with hotels at the train station.
"And Daddy brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the speaker remembered.
True, he added that there was no such thing now in the city: calling to your home would have consequences and would be scary.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of the hotel and government will have to be remembered.
The Girinian leaked the Amur region.
I admired Girinovsky's clown in the State Duma today.
He did things like this when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region".
The protocols do not shake - for there is nothing; the LDPR does not appear to have any protocols other than those signed by the lirkomas.
Here he is picking up Ivan Abramov's second seat and screaming, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then he attacks Rodnina for nothing, and then, after having a fight with the chairman, he takes the faction out of the conference room, screaming literally, "You're all with your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but rather on the scandal and the faction's march as a result of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfovich was nice and elegantly leaking the Amur region along with Abrahamov.
For the whole country, it's just another Girinovsky act of "Shoots!", not a protest by a political party against the results of a particular election.
Both the faction formally scandalized, and the election, according to the party's website and Facebook site, Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is obviously coming off the subject.
Makes the dead in Amura bury their own dead, and the good news itself is against "One Russia" in general and the innocent Rodnina.
It's a fine decision not to lose a face, not a real, not a show-off scandal.
It's another thing that's now in a weird situation for the Abrahams themselves.
Except for screaming from his superiors, he didn't wait for anything. There's no record of any alternative in his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for a narrow circle, he is the formal reason for insulting a respected champion and, even cooler, the hamish attacks on ER and ONF.
And then, of course, he has to really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the number two regional policy and candidate number one for the only single-member regional district, he can become a match that has successfully used his own party leadership and super-irritator for the same ONF and party leadership of another.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Girinovsky, but he should have been invented and observed with respect.
The tram's still growing and growing.
There's news that LDPR will return to the hall during the next prisoner.
I mean, the bath fell for nothing.
The only thing that's going on here is Abrahamov's theme.
It's beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe." - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre of Charity in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He stated that, under the circumstances, the interests of mankind should be above those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while that was a source of admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees - fine, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions to bring real peace and development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force had never solved those problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US's violent response had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it had unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand disinfectant in the last four years
Toxicological centres in the United States have reported an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a high-alcohol hand disinfectant since 2010, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's toxicology centre, cases of children under 12 years of age swallowing of hand disinfectant fluids reported to the toxicological centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 1,117 in 2014.
"The children are more likely to be in contact with these substances, and unfortunately some percentage of them are being sent to the E.R.," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant as cheap drinks.
Young people reportedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouth-washing fluid to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant smell of disinfectant.
"The kid doesn't think it's gonna hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfectant) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfective hand fluids with strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The disinfective hand fluid contains about 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprayings can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicology center at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't leave a glass of whiskey for nothing, but people keep these hand disinfectants in plain sight, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a strawberry-flavored hand disinfectant at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice that of an adult who was legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to prevent any signs of brain trauma, as alcohol had caused the girl to fall and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-addictive substances or disinfective napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant hand fluids from children ' s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing an disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-grade students in the north of New York conspired to poison their anti-bacterial teacher through "the distribution of anti-bacterial substances in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectants, and she forbade them from her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk" and addressed discipline to the school district.
As Barnaul's oldest children's library became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. Children ' s Library of Krupski, the iron owl is sad.
Kids who come for books are trying to feed her candy.
For generations now, this library has been visited for 95 years.
The earliest readers in the twentieth century had loud readings, play plays in Mayakovsky's poems, conduct literary quiz, and write with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalin wrote in 1939, "the friendship between Hope Constantin Krupa and friends of the Barnaul Children's Library" became stronger every day.
The hope of Konstantinovna even sent out one day a child's photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadia Konstantinovna wouldn't mind the library taking her name, she wrote that no, she wouldn't.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-granddaughters of the first readers have to explain to whom this harsh profile decorates the barellef in the library building.
During the years of restructuring, people often called, resented: Why isn't the children's library renamed?
Let's have a library of the name of some good children's writer, with no political color!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to keep it as it is.
"Krubsky" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick track.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of artist Oli Moskovka.
Olya used to be a law firm manager, she came to work at 8:00, she left at 5:00, and all the other managers were only different from the love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet, "You need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mom has cancer."
Olya was making illustrations, and she thought life could end at any moment, and there would be no wonders in it if you didn't create it yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates the children's books of writers all over the world, and writes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, children are thought to lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says the director of Tatiana Kushweed's library, Russian Planet.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's gonna live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is returning.
The library lobby has a large exhibition window with updated photo exposure.
Every quarter, new pictures of readers who go to the library as a family — Mother, Dad, and Children — are posted.
In the library, it's a pleasure to see more and more dads coming with the kids.
If the child was two years old and read all of Chukovsky's, he needs books that are more complicated when he is older.
But there is now a law that prohibits an eight-year-old wundercindu from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a kid has to bring his parents - they come back, then they come back, and gradually Crupy becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library, a pre-revolutionary collection of yates and heresies, leading Korollenko in an annex to the magazine "Niva", the 1936 "Murzilka".
'Cause we're not just the conceptual space of the book, we're now open to movement, we're trying to become a special place, not home, not work, not school,' explains Tatiana Kushweed.
We can all come here to read, play, paint.
We've made the play area for the babies - the baby just comes to play, and the arm still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are taking away their parents, and they're sticking their legs, they don't want to leave.
Moms often come with prams, and we're glad they put the library first among all the other places to come with the babies.
Tatiana Kushweed says: Today's children, just like we used to love classical child literature:
"The publishing industry is developing and much attention is being paid to authors, who are the link between generations."
And when it comes to little babies, it's important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like breaking up with their heroes.
The Library regularly publishes booklets for parents that describe what is happening in modern children's literature, what books are worth paying attention to, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intrigued that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege only has children.
...There's a square hatch in the outermost room of the library with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the book storeroom.
The steps will be squeaking under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend: hello, it's a good thing you and I don't change.
Ellie's still hilarious walking on a road full of yellow bricks, Tol's lazy Gingers stealing magic matches, and Boych-Kibalchish never told the damn War Secret bourgeois-- that's his firm word.
Books like passwords, you can recognize yours anywhere.
There are some in the vault, and there are very rare books, such as a pre-revolutionary collection of yates and heresy.
Or lead Korolenko on the famous Niva magazine app.
Or a 1936 "Murzyla" board.
Time has aged pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the pieces of our future collection, and I've always dreamed of retiring and dealing with rare children's books.
But the kids aren't gonna take it, so to speak: the paint in the old books isn't very bright, and the topics are... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it's like, why did we all write that "Pioner's Truth"?
But it was interesting," says Galina Ilasova, the head of the book store.
The pages of "Murzyla" are getting dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs a book store for the rest of her life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, in which school year Harry Potter became captain of Griffindor's team at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the engine silencer, and who Alice Celesner's father works for.
The librarian pays little for his work, and anyone who can live without these books is very quick to find another profession.
Only the most convinced remain — educators, teachers, and ministers of the religion of the book.
You can also recognize them by smiling - it's believed to be a professional characteristic of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first moment of the conversation, it's a professional.
I love children's books at all: as a librarian, I like them to be, to stand on the shelves, beautifully, and I love reading them,' says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fantastic.
I read modern Russian writers, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the rangers.
And I'm happy when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There's no disagreement in Celtic.
Griffith denied talking about Celtic's differences after Dale admitted that Hoops was in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January, which could disrupt team unity.
Dons increased the advantage of Celtic to five points.
The penalty of Adam Rooney in the first half gave Aberdin a slight advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, which allowed Dons to lose Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denied talking about disagreements.
This led to rumours about Celtic's disagreements, which were cut off by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottishs aren't in the title fight-- de Bur.
Former Rangers quarterback and former Netherlands member Ronald de Boer claimed that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtics because he was not competing for a title with Rangers.
De Boer, now a representative of Ajaxa, said, "The most attractive moments of the Seltica games no longer appear in Holland, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about an old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Firm's games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm gonna change things," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
After the defeat of Malmyo and, as a result, the withdrawal from the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdin football players, who now lose by five points, the top line of the table.
But Dale said, "The Celtic had bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And neither do we, but we need to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic support, because that makes players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton has no confidence in January's transfers.
Despite the views that emerged just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of January's transfers, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is suspicious of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy team unity.
Former attacker Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which is what you saw in our own group this season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu, who's interested in Celtic, hinted that his career was over.
The attacker, Swansi Michou, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, implied that he could leave football after the end of his contract with Swans.
A 29-year-old player suffered from an ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to confront SFA about Neilson's statements.
"Harts" was recorded at 2:1 when Paterson was removed and started to lose 3:2, but the red defense card was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson wouldn't give up on what he said, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tyncasl.
The stubborn player of the Hybernian team received a reprimand after admitting that he was singing a song with offensive words about former player "Harts" Rudy Scazel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby began in Tynkasla in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can say with certainty that I wasn't going back to Tynkasle if he didn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannady's board is confident in Dundee United management.
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration of the field must end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
MacInnes is glad that "unbelievable" won from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdin team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Asis to win the seventh consecutive league victory, which put them five points above Celtic, top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInness said, "There's no team here that wins anything-- a cup, or a league championship that didn't win a meeting like that."
The unemployment rate among Scottishs remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
THE number of unemployed persons in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was above the United Kingdom level of 5.5 per cent, as indicated by the National Statistics Service (NS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 currently employed.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent per quarter, which is higher than the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Minister of Scottish Affairs, David Mandela, commented on the most recent figures: "The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma?
Today, while avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'm gonna be sitting at the death row gallery in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The request was first made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I began to fear.
So why would you do that?
I said yes because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who want more than places are often allowed, the results of the dark lottery determine who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it with no emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I got our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twittering my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would be better able to formulate" herself, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he was talking.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international magazine to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellever, Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not gonna go into the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry van Treese's murder make him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man I like die without need.
A person being pursued by the police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River
The Constable of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth's man intended to leave the police, but failed to get stuck in dirty water in shallow waters a few metres away from a police officer trying to "simplify him to the shore."
Canning Weil's police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into other people's territory in Bakkingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them when he left for Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," said Sergeant Sgt. Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavetz didn't really want to get his uniform wet, so he used a safer technique, "needs with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do weird things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Castledine.
That's exactly what Ben Casins remembers.
In 2006, Casins moved into a ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol for alcohol testing, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but he inspired the locals to invent a joked "Ben Casins Biathlon."
Peter Moody accuses the flight attendant of trying to spy and threatens to leave horse sports.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's flight attendant of trying to inject a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
He was targeted by flight attendants and ethics officers Racing Victoria, who were accused of organizing a campaign against him in person, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai from the start due to drug violations on the day of launch, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always doing his best in racing, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's trial on cobalt, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue to the suspicion of espionage for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't gonna say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's so out of control that you can't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep hard.
I want to walk with my head high and I want my owners to know I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking they're not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody previously made a sensational statement during an interview at Racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stables.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'd call if asked and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all certainly apply, as they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, the external CEO of RVL, knew about it all the time and now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't the RVL have the courage to hold people other than coaches accountable for what's going on in this business?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think it's true.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to a point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Coach's annoyance was only growing during a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari incident, and his last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him say that he could "screw his license on the table."
Moody, most famous for preparing Black Caviar's invincible championship, described the requirements for the use of medication on competition day as "laughing" after the horse's feet were filled with clay compress, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a racing violation.
"I must be held fully responsible for this," he said.
One of my employees, by mistake, gave her a compress on her leg.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could've gotten it yesterday, like she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
The Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medication on the day of the compress competition, on which the flight attendant opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who ran and escaped from the Cobram accident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram on the weekend and escaped from the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the Shepparton police force.
He is expected to be charged with abandonment of the scene, failure to provide assistance and violation of other traffic regulations.
The motorcyclist, 40-year-old Cobrama, remains stable in the hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, is upsetting the opposition's accusations of using hard force.
Coach "Melburn Storm" Craig Bellamy described his team's criticism of grabbing the ball as "addicting the agenda" by two NRL championships.
Coach "Sydney Rusters" Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storma to "fight" his team during the sudden victory of Storm in the finals of the Sydney qualification game on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett gave a clear hint of Storm after his team won the finals of the qualification tournament at the Northern Queensland Cabories on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and claimed that two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy defended the catch with his team and claimed that they were just focusing on the contact by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced of the criticism of his team by two top coaches, as that meant that they were concerned about a possible defeat by Storm.
"It keeps popping up--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us with a 24-2 bill," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques for a year, just in the last six weeks, we've focused on the contact of the ball intercept, and it's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's "impressive football" idea, reminding his teacher that St. George's Illavard Dragon's Bennett won the 2010 Championship, showing "sick" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football, especially his young halfbacks at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have players like that.
He made that comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style-- not every team has two like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play it.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storma and Rusters were competitions with more points than the Broncos and the Caboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
At our game, he was 8:18, there were two other attempts -- and what, is that an impressive football?
Or consider the breaks and failed attempts impressive?
It's routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm has a weekend off at the end of this week, because they won the right to host either North Queensland Caboys or Cronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the AAMI Park preliminary finals, the tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
A defendant of drug possession, a Serb released on bail of $200,000.
A man who faces life imprisonment for trying to steal 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on a $200,000 bail.
Marco Maximovich, aged 29, is one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht that left South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumera in August.
During the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met them at the Comera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maksimović faces a life sentence for trying to steal enough drugs to sell, Maksimović ' s lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter attempted to obtain the entire shipment and that the man could have been in a cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich ' s mother and stepfather were asked to make a joint deposit of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both of them that the sum of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan observed.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail on condition that he surrendered his Australian and Serbian passports, registered daily with the police and observed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katicaris: "I'm proud of Greece, which has fought to the last seconds."
The main coach of the Greek team, Fotis Katicaris, paid tribute to his team after the match of 1/4 of the Eurobasket Finals 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was determined by individual mistakes.
It was a big game, quote AFP Katicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
They tried to work in defense, but the mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned the function of Kauna at the CSA."
CSA rookie Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the curse of the Armenians.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse its negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I've spoken to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quote Freeland's R-Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to reset the center position, but I've been playing more forwards in the NBA.
Now we're gonna have to confront the big central rival, but I've done this before, so I think I can handle it.
The Army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they've made it to the Final Four six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling the team was jinxed.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course it's hard, I understand the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning Euroleague, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moskwichs have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSA's year.
As for the jinx, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, everything is possible.
I don't have any rituals before games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match with Roma will be special."
Barcelona's chief coach, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the League Championship Championship Championship Championship match with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face fight between his current and his former team would be far from private.
Let us recall that Luis Enrique trained the "wolves" during the 2011/12 season, but failed to prove himself better in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience.
I have extremely warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The important thing is to start the Champion League with a win.
The August meeting at Joan Gamper's Cup will not affect the action of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to the Romance game she showed in series A against the Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: The Krasnodar has different options for attacking."
Acting Coach-in-Chief of the Ural, Vadim Skripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th round of the premiere league with the Krasnodar, noted the diversity of the opposing schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of assault in their arsenal.
The match will take place on 21 September and begin at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
Let's see how we play with the Redstar, and we'll see if we can find out what the official website of "The Urala" is saying to Sviolinchenko.
We've got a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, different kinds of attacks, while we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.

Benfica is higher than class, but in a home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses away.
It's quite real.
But first we have to think about Galatasara and then Atletico.
In home games, we can take the glasses away from anyone.

The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counter-attacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying Real played perfectly, but we had plenty of naked opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and score four.
Cristiano Ronald has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll do it all the time.
"Cristiano Ronaldo can't compare to Messi."
Barcelone's advocate, Geordi Alba, believes that no one can compare with his single club, Lionel Messi.

Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also a bright personality.
"Daniel De Rossi, a Roma quarterback, had noted the importance of compactness and insurance in a game with such a strong rival on the eve of the League of Champions' Championship match.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 9:45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, S.E.'s gonna run her text message.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with beautiful players, quoting UEFA's official website De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue-granates because they have not only unique styles, but also bright identities.
To keep them, we'll have to plow through the whole game and protect each other.
Massey is almost always successful when it comes to oblivion, so we need to remain compact and organized.

I hope I'm going out in my next start-up match, "R-Sport" is Yezov's word.
I'm not a rat expert, I'm a goalkeeper, we don't have a recap of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everybody had bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She checked him and found shocking photographs, and immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, then examined the computers found at the address and found "relevant" search engine requests using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the cops that he did it, because it might be "to attract paedophiles," and then he would "be pretending he's a cop to scare them."
The C.E.O. Ailid Robertson told the Dundy Sheriff's court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare paedophiles.
He was questioned about talking to an unknown person who sent him pictures and about asking for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw indecent images on her phone, and the defendant was being held at face-to-face.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail terms on 25 January of this year and not appearing in court on 24 March of this year.
Counsel for the defendant Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed on the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it could be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, until after receiving social services reports.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody before the hearing of the remaining cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences prior to the date of sentencing.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest statesman, fell down the runway earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to warn them against mugabe's whistle-blowering during the speech.
A month ago, they whistled to the President during his address to the nation in Parliament, a speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Goneze, MP of the Movement for Democratic Change, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that was not displayed, but it was entitled "Death", he told journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned those members of Parliament that immunity ended in the Parliament building, and once they came out, parliamentary immunity did not work.
Member of Parliament stated that the party headed by Morgan Tswangirai was "satisfied" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service cost reduction programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job losses would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting with the fourth quarter, as described in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and the portfolio of business will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn more than $50 billion annually and "will focus on providing previously impossible integrated technological solutions" to companies, as reported in the company's statement.
This is how the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment, their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is undergoing a large-scale reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is a step by HP, the second-largest personal computer manufacturer in the world, and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, a recent development in this sector based on the belief that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Captain "Arsenal" Michael Arteta says that his one-club mates should support a traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing with "Dynamo Zagreb."
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery were to proceed according to plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most unfortunate thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire had a confident ending of the previous season with the only ankle injury and was about to return to the usual aggressive game style during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with an ankles or injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 different injuries in his six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal scenario more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Prime League clubs with the largest number of missing days due to injury.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in injury statistics will continue in the last season.
"Sometimes when you're back in service after a trauma, you've been vulnerable for a while - you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of it, as well as his career as he deserves.
The Arsenal is starting a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday against Dynamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the convoy.
Hector Belierin and Aaron Ramsey have not come to Croatia, so Mathieu Debyushi and Arteta are likely to be on the start-up team.
Wenger may also join Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give some time off to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favourite in group F, the Maxime stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost any of the 41 games since they managed to spend last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned a lesson from the last season when the team was defeated in the Monaco Champion League game, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champion's Cup finals.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious male friendship lessons
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men's need for frankness has become, now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at the highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an attempt to understand the issue of the Campaign Against the Poor Life, it has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if the patient had a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chances of mental disorders.
But, of course, friendship works, first of all, it needs to be.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, where style prefers content, speed of response is often more valuable than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, happy, and successful, even if loneliness prevails in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which have a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noticed, the video game maker, you can't buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was not determined through their work, but rather through an individual who showed up in contact with friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighs on Rachel all come from the realization that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritens said to me, "My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal, emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often, those who come to us feel unable to speak to their friends.
The old "live with it" lesson is strong, as is the feeling that a frank talk about problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of an outsider by telephone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the decorations have been completely restored for the party, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better, if you see a lonely man in Starbucks, smile and say "hello."
I don't know what friendship can do in advance.
The Friends show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, #FriendsFest
Dee Maria scores a goal by helping the P.W.P.S. defeat the Malmyo.
Angel de Maria, on an equal basis with Blaise Matuudi and Edinson Cavanaughie, celebrates the balls at the Malmø Gate.
Angel de Maria, making his debut at the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed PSA to easily bypass Malmyo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the game response.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Cavanaughey did their job when "Pari Saint-Germain" started their game in the Champion League with an extremely convenient 2-0 win against "Malmyo" in Park de Prence on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League began as a PSA player to direct the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavanny scored the goal at 61.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shahter in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against Swedish champions, as they were not aiming to qualify playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached quarter-finals.
They scored glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich as useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against a team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or guests in the Champions League, so win the 2-0 score, bring problems to the rivals and play a great defense -- that's a good start, even if there are other things we need to refine during the season," said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, though I wish we'd scored one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned from an injury in one of the shifts on the Paris team, which brought her a draw of 2:2 in a match with "Bordo" in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back by Di Maria at the fourth minute.
The Argentine assailant was identified as a player capable of bringing the PSA to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran out of Marco Verratty's past the Malmö defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villanda into the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from the PSA at the time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmyo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage with nine world-level players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two team members in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nikola Djordjic's blow, where the ball flew past the far bar of Kevin Trump's gate at the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
At times, however, PWP has failed itself with unsuccessful broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who in the first half alone was unable to carry out at least five attempts, and then failed to process Kavani's beat ball as soon as the game resumed.
However, he showed himself to be much more capable in exact passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who received the ball, Di-Marie, with a curled blow, which passed the bar by Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after a clock mark thanks to Kavana, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich had picked up the ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmyo had about returning to the game, and only the interception of the ball by Wiland at close range prevented David Louis from increasing his final account before the replacement of Esqueel Lovessi was counted as a goal in the very end of the match.
Ague Hareida, the Malme coach, later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the Champion League was in December of last year."
Since then, we've only been playing in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Glory "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

In the course of the deliberations of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that the victims ' claims be fully recovered - eight million roubles.
The accident in question occurred on 22 May at around 3 a.m. in the vicinity of house 30 on the Kutuzov prospectus.
The BMW vehicle, which was driving Mirzoev, crossed the opposite lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The man was born in 1989 and died at the scene of his injuries.
The victim's friends on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motor drive from the Vorobian Mountains to the Moscow GUMVD building on Petrovka, 38.

The Governor of Tumen province, Vladimir Yakushev, signed more than 40 orders and orders at a meeting of the Presidency of the Regional Government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and health institutions in the municipalities of the province.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for a school in the Nizhnetavdi district and for major repairs to the regional hospital in the Casan district.
As described in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major repairs to the second floor of the therapeutic unit.

A second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On 17 and 18 September, the second Forum of Regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, with the participation of a delegation from Thailand headed by the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation are described by the honorary consul-general of the Republic of Belarus in Tümení Vladimir Schüszlös, who was part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the tasks of the Soschi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, which are important links between the two States.
President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation and President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus are scheduled to participate in the plenary meeting.
The plenary and breakout sessions will focus on the experiences of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, legal and regulatory provisions and programmes of the Federal State.
The forum will be addressed by the Governor of Tumen province.
I think that this is an indication of the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new and beneficial contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At that time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The fact that a permanent seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tümeni also highlights the importance of our work.
In addition, an APC delegation from the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in agricultural training, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industry.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakusev spoke of the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult circumstances.
The question of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms was raised - they were needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end-user.
Problems in the work of the Belshina Commercial House in Thailand and options for preventing loss were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects should work well and make a profit to the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of the MAZ passenger and cargo equipment, the development of the MAZ service centre, which was established in Tumen on the basis of the TATP.
The discussion also touched on the preparation of the regional working delegation ' s visit to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of discussion was the finalization and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promise to rise to a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional centre.
During our meeting with the head of administration of the city of Tümeni, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the ladane, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed, which will be run on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen Elevator works with one of the leading producers of the Mogilftmash Elevator, receiving components.
In my view, this activity could be more active, given the programmes to install new elevators at the regional centre.
In addition, within the framework of the consul ' s expanded powers, a meeting was held with Alexey Kokorin, Governor of the Kurgan region, during which the issue of increased trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaural was discussed.
A meeting with the Ottoman Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tumen can be called the district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of honorary geneconsul.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they can address many problems directly and quickly, reducing their severity and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the present circumstances, it is essential not to destroy the damage while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people in film production.
Matt Damon argued with an African-American producer, Effy Brown, saying backstage that it was not necessary to consider ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black character in the scenario chosen for the project.
"The diversity is appropriate when you cast for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Wow, well-well, all the time when an actor from Marsianne was making comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers joined Damon and Brown.
"I'd like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of Harmony's image they're going to stick to," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Dear White People, advocated for the film to be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "In the end, we can get what we want."
After this discussion was broadcast on television, social media blew up an unconscionable comment about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "Explanation of the diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room that hurts."
Tweeted over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes".
Damon ' s comments appear at a time when the sound coverage of the racial issue in the media is the most pressing issue on the public agenda.
After a youth named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the coloured population.
In February, singer Prince mentioned this movement at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the movement's leaders reported.
It has recently been announced that Damon is on the list of show-business figures, producers and media magnates invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior awards the first champion.
The professional rock climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, season 7 of which just ended, none of the participants have yet been able to get through all stages of the road with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldiero and Jeff Britten, made their way to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a rope 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to perform the task, and was the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, who had passed the exhausting stage of 4, but Caldjero did the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After a victory with enormous work, Caldiero, who was shocked by winning a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"It's incredible to think about it, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," said Isaac to E reporters! such a serious leap in my income.
And all of a sudden... I never imagined how it would be... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with the journalists of The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finals and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, would not receive any monetary prize.
According to the rules, the fastest bidder gets the money.
"If the final players are more than one, the prize is awarded to the fastest of them," Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still enjoys great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of excited reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his kids and his wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was gonna lose, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "Americana Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin to be filmed in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers is quietly going around Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't much fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now the last one in the Central Division of the American League.
Just pretending to be an obstacle, the Tigers won the "Minnesot Twins" on Tuesday at 5-4 at Target Field.
Twins missed a chance to cut by half the game the back of Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroit, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which eluded them most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they turn out," said the manager of the Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Peter Tigers, Alfredo Simon, made his contribution in support of the attacks, resulting in Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good grades," said Simon.
Pitchers can't drop in every game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, the appointed stabber for the Tigers, managed to strike three strikes and sustained two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three blows since the four hits against Seattle Marines on July 6.
"He was a good bat," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in the quality of the batter, was markedly better in the work of the bat, and preserved that quality for the game.
With three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of getting back into the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning on the left-hand line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks took the first base with a bow, and Brian Dozier's second baseman got a strike-out on Simon's swing before he took over by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy beat Moira, the only player on the road, before the newly appointed hitter Miguel Sano, who knocked a two-rann "single" to the left of Drew Verhagen's right-hand hand.
With a couple of ranners out of the out and matching the wound at the second base, Verhagen managed to lead Trevor Pluff's third baseman to a double-play.
It was the 27th time for the top league player in this season when Pluff kicked the ball on a double play.
After Detroit added insurance wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moir earned RBI "drop" in between the outfielders against Bruce Rondon's closing pitcher, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-wing player beat Sano down after three strikes and received his fifth Saive.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, temporarily out of practice, at the beginning of the game.
Tigers made three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of traumatised until the game itself, missing over a month in connection with the cinnamon inflammation.
"It's definitely not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable, so I was able to make some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw the single to the second baseman, Ian Kinsler.
Wook took Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game, at two outs of Ryatfielder J. D. Martinez.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 in 21" series with the ranners in a performance position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a single single, with another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the score in the second inning by getting a single-out "dubble" from Catcher James McCann and a two-out "single" central chopper Anthony Goose, which became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose throws were thought to have been cast in a third inning, was then replaced by A. J. Achter's right-hand reliver.
Hughes counted three wounds for six hits and four strike-out ducks.
NOTES: Pietcher-right-hand "Tygers" Anibal Sanchez dropped out of the players due to the spraining of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed a shoulder surgery on Sanchez as early as 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, is scheduled to go off on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-left pitcher, Daniel Norris, will leave the trauma list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who was released from the Tigers at four starts since it was acquired in exchange for David Price's left-handed pitcher on July 30, has one victory and one defeat.
He hasn't been in the game since August 20, due to the stretch of the oblique muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games on the Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played against Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint filed by Kadyrov in the book "Molba to God" was brought before the South Sahel Court.
The South Sahel City Court received the original appeal from President Chechnya's representative Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book Molba to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam, "Interfax" refers to the President of Horsud Alexander Chuhrai.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by certain deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation concerning the need to check the hormones for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIL.
"Let them comment on such nonsense themselves," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahel City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as "extremist material".
The South Sahalinsk Public Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal on Friday night.
There are nuances: at the prosecutor's office, they believe that they asked the court to consider the author of the book to be extremist only, not the Ayats of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chuhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were quoted from the Qur'an, "We worship you, and we pray for your help," and "Do not invoke anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "the Shaitans and the Provocators."
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit by law court decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma must pass a law that prohibits judicial decisions relating directly to the texts of the Koran and other divine Scriptures," wrote Kadyrov in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to remove posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect users ' complaints about illegal content.
It is the intention of the Facebook leadership, together with the German Ministry of Justice, to combat xenophobia and racism online.
The previous day, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, had stated that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media professionals to set up a special group of moderators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove incorrect comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the non-satisfied posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for their removal.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints from social media users about offensive posts should also help to block illegal content quickly.
The Facebook authorities intend to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative remarks against migrants and refugees, the social media and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after xenophobic sentiment had increased dramatically in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that struck the European Union some time ago.
In Germany, for example, there is already a overcrowding of all sites intended to accommodate refugees.
The previous day, the country ' s authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa were accommodated in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
Relaxation areas will be available in Moscow's graveyards.
In the near future, several metropolitan graveyards will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological recreation.
The first will be Butovsky, Domodedov, and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will be available in other parts of the city.
Artem Yekimov, the head of the Ritual State Budget Institution, described the portal to m24.ru.
Relaxation zones will be small green areas that resemble parks.
According to the experts, in such "campus corners", the visitors to the cemetery will be able to rest, be alone and restore psychological strength.
Relaxation zones will soon be built in Domodedov, Butov and Shcherbin graveyards and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual GBB, if there is a need to expand the cemetery area, the builders will try to keep the existing forest as large as possible.
Green stands will serve as a living fence that separates the rest areas and the areas directly allocated to the burial sites.
The Ritual experts also indicated their intention to propose a waiver of fences at graves.
New graveyards can actually become barrier-free.
In addition, the Ritual was told of the readiness to set up electronic terminals through which cemetery visitors would be able to recognize GPS coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
For example, digging a grave during the summer will cost a thousand rubles less, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
Note that in the past year, prices for all forms of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the Ellen forest.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours without food in the forest.
The relief workers and volunteers together helped to detect the gravel.
Alexander Blinnikov, reporter: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambovsky region spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
His family, rescue workers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even dogs in the movies, but there was no result.
The man was able to be identified after a helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to pick up the bends and pickups, but did not return by the evening.
Relatives immediately sought help, and the next day, rescuers and concerned residents from a neighbouring village, only about 30, were brought up to search for the mushroom.
They were joined by a helicopter from the fire and rescue centre for the fifth day.
Andrei Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone a long way, somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
It's a miracle that's alive.
The mushroom was taken to the Lenin central district hospital unconscious, in extremely difficult condition.
Medical doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
As an elderly man was able to survive five days in the woods, doctors do not know at all.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the Elinian CRS's therapeutic unit: "Personal examination, treatment."
Infusion therapy, anti-bacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition has improved in the morning, remains difficult, but with positive momentum.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes every year to Smolenshina from the Tambovsky region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the mushroom found, said, "Les near the road, not really local."
For just a few years, he came to visit his family.
Well, I went to get the mushrooms.
I guess he went a little far and got lost.
With the start of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
Five similar cases in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind us that in the woods you have to walk in bright clothes, with little food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave a trail so that we can go back.
Emergency An-2 sat down in a brother's taiga.
There's an emergency AN-2 in Siberia right on the wire.
An aircraft from the Red Yard airline, Yenisei, landed on an emergency landing 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities and no casualties, but the plane itself sustained significant damage upon landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
He had three crew members on board - a commander, a second pilot and a flight mechanic - reporting to Interfax.
The crash aircraft flew along the Iron-Elimsky-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already arrived in Bratsk.
The brother ' s Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with the air safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office arrived at the scene.
In September 2010, the Tou-154 crew landed its plane with passengers due to a technical failure at an abandoned camouflage airfield in Komi.
Engines and onboard electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
The aircraft had 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the plane's emergency landing.
Leading the Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalization
Printing the processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in developing economies is on the rise.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Choices of INE, Nobel Prize Laureate for the Economy of 2007.
The world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets over the past 20 years.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Supporters of globalization had predicted greater benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," Maskin points out.
China and India, for example, have experienced strong growth in per capita GDP.
But it's not all that happy.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the "haves" and "haves" in poor countries, which is reflected in high income inequality and, more specifically, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in her article "Why Global Markets Did Not Reduce Inequality in Developing Economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by NEE WHE.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Kramer, Harvard University, Eric Maskin, developed an alternative theory that shows why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, resembles the ECU.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin provides four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, professionals D from poor countries lack the skills to work with professionals A and B from rich countries.
And while level C workers from poor countries are growing their wages by working with rich B employees, D workers are not feeling growth, or their wages are falling at all.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to widening the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thereby increasing inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin have offered an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor in charge of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Decision Choices, head of the Department of Mathematics of the INES.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, according to the scientist, the workers themselves do not have the means to do so, and companies do not have the means to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Maskin believes that Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role.
The scientist points out that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the globalization process, which has produced and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: The living bond of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, celebrates its 2,000th anniversary in September.
In the celebration programme, the Dagestan National Culture Festival and the past-style fair, the Derbent carpet exhibition and the Day of Open Temples, the 2,000-year history and music show in two hours, and tours to the reconstructed Petra I Museum.
The medieval stones of the Naryn Kala fortress, the old Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and the palace gardens, all seem to have come down from the pages of the Millennium and One Night.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazarian Caganate and the Golden Ord.
The eastern tablets that grow up in the court of Derbent Juma Méchette are several centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian Programme of Trees - Wildlife Monuments.
The Shadow of the Racing Crown saves the pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will be given a scented tea and be served with Dahestan's treats — honey figs, hurma, musmula, weed cakes, airan and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, they use large samurai to drink tea at one time to many guests.
The inscription above the Juma Mosque entrance says the building was built in 115 A.H.
That's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is stunning by its scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults are based on square columns and lighted by the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is the traditional passion of Derbent residents.
The owners of the birds put pigeons in the backyards, under the trees, in the attics.
An exciting sight is the rise in the sky of a pack of white pigeons, similar to the flashes of a festive fireworks.
The ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall to defend themselves against the enemy.
As it sailed 500 metres into the sea, the building locked the Harbour of Derbent.
In 2003, Derbent's serfdom walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument to the ancient Fortifical Area.
The carpets in Derbent were weaving as far back as the fifth century, and so far, the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the urban market, carpets are sold for any taste - wool pals, cotton, or wolves of all colours and shades, with and without a ox, with complex ornament and fancy trench.
The city's construction began with magic blocks with single-storey stone structures.
Over the years, the magicians have hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on walls and street lights remind you that you are not in medieval but in modern cities.
In the old part of the city, the parts of the water supply built by the Persians about a thousand years ago were preserved.
To date, ancient water sources have reached the local population today.
Many derbents prefer regular tap water to water from verified historical fountains.
There was one of the pottery centres in Derbent.
The fillers and groceries, the dishes, the jugs, the cups were valued on the entire Caucasus.
The hands of the honchers are still making wonderful ceramics for practical and souvenir use.
During the holidays and festivals, a crowd gathers under a tight rope, which is attended by students of the Republican School of Circulatory Art.
The history of amazing and risky skill spans several centuries.
A new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the cable-horses.
There's an Ancient Derbent Culture and Welfare Museum in the former Girl's Bunny building today.
There used to be single girls and brides accompanied by girlfriends, and now anyone who wanted to see a bathing room, a hot and cold swimming pool.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and boyfriends are as popular these days as they were in the old days.
The benefits of steam warming up the body are written in old books.
After bathing, blood improves, muscles lose fatigue, and the body becomes flexible and easy.
The Commonwealth Festival, which is held in Naryn Kala fort, is attended by the ethnic subsectors of many parts of Dagesthan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform the songs of the Caucasus and treat the customers with delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlar is the burial site of the 40 martyrs who put their heads on for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for the Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellow sarcophagus has been removed from solid stone blocks and directed, as is customary for Arabs, along the west-east axis.
The brothers Gavrill and Albert Jakubowa are cutting and shaving customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser's been here for years.
Circulatory crafts are passed on from generation to generation.
In doing so, the Yakubov brothers can make not only the traditional but also the most modern hair.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, a decabrist writer who was exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkmen language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life, and everyday life.
Chaihana is a traditional Eastern club where only tea and homemade baked goods are served.
Men come here to satisfy their thirst, communicate with their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not encouraged to step in the chaikhan threshold.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already been able to participate in national and Russian-level events.
The ensemble's solists practice every day, learning perfectly popular Awar, Dargin, Tatian, and Armenian dances.
As the evening draws to a close, when the noise and the street lights light up, the local people sit in the shops near the houses with the protruding terraces.
As a rule, derbents discuss household matters.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly remembering episodes of the unique history of their city that affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspean region.
There was a business game at the airport in Domodedov.
In the capital, a new form of education is being tested.
Four hundred students tried to act as airport staff.
For this purpose, three airguvan models were installed in Domodedov.
Young people not only searched and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
It's all in the form of a business game, but it's not as complicated as reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the stairwell was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in the Domodedova hangar, the standard set of tasks to be performed by the newbies.
One hangar has three major airports from around the world.
There are now four hundred students from colleges and universities in the capital.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inside world of the airline.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage turnover - even buses in the field, stairways and passenger searches.
And passengers are a lot of trouble.
One had a problem with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to deal with all this, like in life, at the minimum.
For each of these tasks it is charged a certain amount, virtual money as if it had been paid by the airline for the maintenance of the voyage.
"They are being fined for failing to do so," explains the financial analyst Dmitry Hilko in an interview with West Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of study.
She's already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional centres of competence will be formed and will in fact become new models of modern colleges with a modern system of management, highly qualified staff and modern equipment", explains the Director of the State Policy Department for the Training of Workers and Supplementary Vocational Education of the Ministry of Science of Russia, Natalia Goldarev.
But students aren't up to global plans.
After three days of training like this, they're gonna need a day off.
At the same time, the grades for this examination were quite material.
The newest smart girls, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport claim," the player in the game is pleased to be the P.R. of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, which is called, were given a pencil to invite them to work by the time they complete their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the American Centre for Foreign Librarians at the Library.
The centre has been operating in Moscow for over 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the American Centre of the United States Embassy at the All-Russian State Library of M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the links between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and in other difficult moments of the long history of our relations," says Ambassador John Tefft of the United States to Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and lasting links between the people and cultures of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors", the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that, about a year ago, it had been decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the Future Leaders Exchange Programme.
The Green Tribunal turned out to be quick to kill.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar ' s desk listening to his grievances about the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of him, said Kumar.
If there's one more brick, we'll have all the buildings destroyed.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a body of the judiciary established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal was able to hear more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to cease construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the 60 years since the independence of the strengthened industrial development, India has evolved from a country of virgin jungles to one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in major mega-cities, where infrastructure development is not keeping pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are being cut off by new residential blocks.
Despite formal government support for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by Nrentra Modi ' s Government, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
Thus, in May this year, the Minister of the Environment described the court's decisions as "extreme" and "unenforceable".
Sometimes the court ' s decisions are indeed impossible to fulfil within the time limit set by the court, as confirmed by the environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, the impossible endlines also have a positive side: at least they force those responsible to move.
"His main purpose is to shake this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled major constructions: it has put an end to the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People, too, are trying to remember: for example, during a discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can shut down your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," said Kumar.
Such explanations, however, are far from being understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single stroke of a judicial pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, thereby causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on the incoming and outgoing vehicles and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, first learning at factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road traffic incidents began to fall into the attention of the courts, popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principal judge was the Gang River Clean-up Program, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganges, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone spilled water from Gang on God's statue, and there was feces in it, the judge was hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think, "Gang is Gang," he'll take all our sins.
It's a river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
Ganga clean-up is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Each year, 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million Hindus bathing in it die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Gang Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the costume was purchased for $700,000, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can identify itself as a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often perceived as a luxury," says the activist Malika Bhanot of the Ganga Z.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between ecology and development."
The man bled a few Dali paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the windows of the museum and ruined the sculpture of Salvador Dali, "An angel's appearance".
There is now an exhibition of the works of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso at the museum.
A male born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately took the wrong course: he ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then started moving around the premises and stained several permanent exposures with blood.
Among them is a portrait of the Hand of the Hand of the Myervaldis Polís.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists Igor Dobuccin, to which "Interfax" refers, the windows have also been damaged.
There are police and art experts at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been instituted against a man.
In the Latvian Union of Artists, an exhibition of the works of Picasso and Dali was held from 4 August to 27 September, at which more than 200 original works of artists were represented.
Commentator Gennady Orlov is hospitalized in Spain.
On Wednesday, Russia's champion, Zenith, from St. Petersburg, will hold his first match in the group phase of the League of Champions with Spanish "Valencia".
Unfortunately, the peterburger game won't be able to comment on Gennady Orlov.
The commentator of the NTV channel Gennady Orlov was hospitalized on Wednesday at a Spanish clinic suspected of acute appendix.
The examination will answer whether Gennady Sergeievich, a 70-year-old, is in need of prompt treatment.
The game will be commented on by Konstantin Genich.
Zenith is on the Champion League team.
His rivals are Spanish Valencia, French Lion and Belgian Ghent.

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in addressing a group facing the challenge of leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, referring to the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Integrating Reforms.
He said that greater openness and deeper reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of investors ' market access, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, there will be a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment.
The system will gradually be sequestered through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business legitimacy and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also loosen its control over the powers it granted to companies, thus ensuring that companies themselves operated their own businesses.
The statement also states that China will allow the border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The Government will not change its policy vis-à-vis foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing and provide them with better conditions", the statement states.
The application procedure for permanent residence for foreigners, or Green Card, will be further facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqian and Ministers Leu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
