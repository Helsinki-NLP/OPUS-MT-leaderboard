TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
China's TikTok social network censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or the banned Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.
Documents in the publication show that the owner of TikTok (byteDance) is promoting foreign policy objectives in China abroad by means of an application.
Most of China's policy-related violations fall under "hate speech".
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context suited to the general rules so that social network actions do not look censored.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of "criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.".
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under "the risk of China's or other countries' history".
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong Eun, Indian politics of Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese premiere Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian premier Narendra Modi, as indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by social media administrators and may cause the user to be blocked.
The second category of violations is not too strict: such publications remain on the website, but their dissemination is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules were outdated and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach to modernize, as well as engaging independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok do not have specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Preduser Center" by Rustam Bogdanov.
The "Preducer Center" is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All blogs' promotional materials, the "Predusser Center", negotiates with social media representatives, but user material can be posted without consultation, and transmits Bogdanov.
To the question of whether it is possible to speak of politics or Putin in TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the agency Our Digital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users of TikTok list in the user agreement: you cannot put out shocking content that discriminates against statements and so on."
But under these rules, you can subdue any content that the moderators don't like, notes the Zaripov.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosmart analyzes faces and determines how long a person looks, tells Bogdanov.
If the neuropath decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork.

Commersant reports this with reference to Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to the telecommunications operators more than 2,500 numbers that had been called by clients of various financial organizations.

Another 218 numbers were blocked and in 59 cases restricted the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Department of Information Security of the CEC, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted with room replacements.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warning of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
At the Bank of Revelation, Rosbank and Alpha Bank, reports of an increase in fraudulent phone calls with room replacements were confirmed.
According to Biline's press service, some of the information on fraudulent calls that the BC gave was incorrect: the lists included numbers actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would cause disruption to the organization ' s work.
Artem Sychev said that Centobank was planning to create a base of fraud numbers to which the telecommunications operator would contact at every call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

Money is more important than football.
Barcelona's blackmailing Neimar.
Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the attacker moved to French Pari Saint-Germain.
The case was almost brought to trial, but the Catalans asked the player to settle the dispute without Femida's intervention.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neimar and his clever father, who is also an Brazilian agent, had an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the Forward ended up in the PSW for a record Euro222 million.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only do Brazilian lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When Neimar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counter-claim.
The Blue Granauts insist that the bonus was in charge of the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only one quarter of the Euro40 million was owed to the player and demands that the proportional part of the first payment be returned.
But the interesting thing is, in the summer, Neimar and Barsa almost agreed to bring back the rogue Catalonia player.
True, the deal failed, but there's still hope for a return forward.
So, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in the pre-trial procedure, it would prevent the Brazilian from returning.
Naymar himself wants to come back so much, he asked for assurances that the Catalan would buy him back.

It is noted that a group of 15 media representatives were given access to the fourth BSEC reactor management room as part of the guide ' s presentation on the exclusion zone.
According to Telegram channel RT, journalists were in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the explosion-torn power unit are still venting radiation, 40,000 times the norm.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant occurred on the night of 26 April 1986.
Twelve provinces in Ukraine and 23% of Belarus were exposed to radiation pollution.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.
It will be recalled that last July, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree that established a green corridor open to tourists in the Chernobyl zone.
Also in the exclusion zone, the ban on filming has been lifted.
Previously, it was reported that the BSEC exclusion zone from Belarus had been opened to tourists.
The tour organizers stressed that in a day, less radiation could be obtained in the zone than during the flight on the plane.

Which club will take Pavel's paroled Mamaev
A football player, Pavel Mamaev, released from parole last week, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
A former halfback for this club can soon sign a contract with the Rostov FC, reports the Championship portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the representatives of Rostov and Mamaeva are now in the final stages.
The contract with a 31-year-old football player is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
"Sport Express" says that Paul Mamaev was to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dynamo the day before, but the test was not performed because of the "undefined situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement between the parties.
He played for the Reddar Club in 2014.
With the team, he won twice the bronze of the Russian Championship.
Previously, Mamaev was in favour of Moscow's Torpedo and CSA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia in 15 games.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a trash can.
A resident of the U.S. city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested for attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in an argument because of a cart found in the trash.
A 54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
It was noticed by Todd Beavers.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the scum.
Miller saw Beavers' find and got upset.
He thought he could claim the cart because he started digging in the trash first.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the Samurai sword he found in the same pile and pursued the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it in the direction of the cart's kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that what's going on is on video.
After seeing the camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to come back.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman entering his yard and taking the cart, screaming insult.
The police were already looking for Miller for a driver without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager had attacked an unknown woman and stabbed her with a sword.
Thus, he reacted that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated at the same hotel where he stayed, were not allowed to light him.
Mass disorder for three.
Moscow's case against the participants in the summer protests the further away, the more visible it gets into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence of the "mass disorder" itself cannot be verified, but in the absence of a political solution, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of charges.
The failure should encourage society, but it will certainly leave the silovists, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence, in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder), Alexei Minialo, was suddenly released without any obligation, and after a few hours was completely rehabilitated: the CSR dropped the charges against him.
Minialo has been under arrest for almost two months and has been joined by several professional communities: historians, priests, literaryists.
Since then, only two accused of involvement in the riots have remained in the case (initially 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who was extended by the court the previous day until the end of December (who is also charged with violence against a representative of the authorities, art. 318).
The court sentenced the author of a joke petition to join the United States of America
The court of the Vidzem Hill of Riga punished the author of the joke petition for Latvia's accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartetsk.
It is reported that the man was given 80 hours of corrective labour and one year of probation.
"The good sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented the Barteck judgment.
He also added that punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures for Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as this petition, the website collected signatures about Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and about the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that criminal proceedings have been instituted against the Bartecki under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the online petition for Latvia ' s accession to Russia received six months ' imprisonment.

The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to punish police officers for insulting them on the Internet.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect law enforcement guards from spreading slanderous and vilifying information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the draft law was made on the federal legal portal, and the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document states that it is being developed in response to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from "dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a degrading nature, including those of a discrediting nature".
The exact manner in which police officers are to be protected from online defamation is not specified.
However, the explanatory note to the document states that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "through the individualization of the mechanism" already predisposed by the law on the blocking of posts insulting the authorities and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, amendments to the Police Act are due to enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing "manifest disrespect for the State" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roscomnadzor warns the resource of the violation and gives it 24 hours to correct it.
The first violation of the prohibitions is punishable by a fine of between 30 and 300,000 rubles, and the second violation by administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Roskomnadzor applied this rule to the media for the first time, blocking the Jaroslav edition of 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Miracle District Court of Novgorod province fined a local citizen 30,000 rubles for posting on the network "two tapes of indecent information that offends human dignity and public morality and manifests a clear disrespect for society, the State and the authorities exercising State authority in the Russian Federation".

Will Phytoestrogens and Phytoandrogans help to prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogen is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pollen-forming.
The phytoestrogens, however, are well-explored and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (including cardiovascular diseases, some cancers).
Prominent sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular soy), hommel, flint seeds.
Many experts believe, however, that such BADs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, in the context of their intake, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that there are too many outside analogs.
He called for the rebirth of Kazakhstan's "Jenis".
Former attacker Rotor and Russian national team Oleg Veretennikov joined the campaign to revive Kazakhstan's Genis.
The Astana Club, which was called "Dinamo", "Celinnic", "Astana" and "Jenis", was disbanded in 2014.
He was protected by his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"Recognized an action to revive the Jenis football club organized by his fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half in this club.
It wasn't the best time in terms of results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and his loyal fans who've always been with the team!
I'm gonna be forever remembered by the Munitepasov stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career!
Genies must be reborn!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe that the city's authorities will return their home club to them!" wrote the Vertetennikovs to Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched the Onicks missile on Chukotka.
The DOD first launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex on Chukotka.
The Onex launched at a distance of 350 kilometres from the target, and 200 of them flew over the land, a record for this type of missile.
Some 10 warships and Pacific fleet vessels, as well as marine aircraft, provided security of fire to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation.
Bastion complexes have never been used on Chukotka before.
The Hydromet Center called it the right people's mark.
In Russia, there are a lot of popular acceptances by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At Hydrometeorological Centre, they checked all the signs that were supposed to be working.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can truly be trusted, though in the short term.
As the scientific leader of Russia's Hydromet Center, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will really be fine, as our ancestors pointed out.
And if the sky shines white, then the rain will be the next day.
The second one is based on bird surveillance.
It's more common to talk about swallows, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
The explanation is simply that when the air humidity is high, the fly is soaked in its wings and the birds are forced to fall in order to hunt insects, TASS writes.
There are people's marks on different continents.
Storm Day is a traditional people's holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.
It is believed that this day you must watch the suture coming out of your hole to determine when spring will come.
Unidentified oil spots found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
Pollution was scattered over 2,000 miles [2,000 km] of the coastline.
The first oil stains discovered began to be reported as early as September 2.
However, their number continued to increase every day until Thursday, as did territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that all of them were identical, and it was crude oil that was involved.
At the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which was given samples for analysis, it stated that they did not correspond to the oil produced in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely she got into the ocean current," told Brazil's G1 news portal the coordinator of the Pernambuco Petroleum Workers' Union and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
And only two of them managed to be saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute will work with Petrobras to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute ' s experts recommend that tourists and locals bypass the oil spots and alert all detected sites of pollution.
Beardev has commissioned a review of the standards for the operation of public utilities.
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev has instructed Rossnemoradzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Enterprise, in conjunction with the business body and the business community, to review the sanitary and epidemiological rules and regulations for the general public.

By the same time frame, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the agencies mentioned above, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for an experiment to restrict control activities for general-health organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tartarstan and Kaliningrad province, as of 1 January 2020.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy were instructed before 11 November to submit to the Government a bill, as amended by the CoAP, on the application of administrative suspension of activities for the violation of the nutritional requirements that caused the damage to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economy, Rossimnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to consider a gradual transition from 2021 to a consumer basket based on a basic set of products to produce a full diet of healthy foods.
Let's remind you, the old standards of business community were spoken of after the closure of a cafe from Anderson.
The business community demanded the cancellation of the existing San Piña, and Rosspernadzor announced that new ones would be jointly developed.
Thirty-three departments are on the list.
In the meantime, Rosusenadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary regulations by 40 times by 2021.

Russians don't have anything to save themselves from retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings to have a bill on a guaranteed pension product in full force in the country.
The practice of increasing the pension on the basis of personal savings is quite common throughout the world.
Another matter is how timely we are to introduce it.
"In my view, a large proportion of the population now has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increasing pension coverage in the future," said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the view of the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, since "the constant changes in this field have completely confused them".
This does not mean that I oppose the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that pensions and social security of citizens are improved.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible, responsive to domestic realities," said V. Matvienko, "RIA News".
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the Pension Guaranteed Product Bill) were to evolve, several basic principles, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and the strict guarantees and responsibility of the State to ensure the preservation of pension savings, should necessarily be included.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (SPP) would be sent for negotiation.
Among its main elements are the purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Disney and Sony Pictures were previously reported to have been unable to reach consensus on income-sharing, leaving the Spider-Man behind.
Sony owns film rights.

In doing so, Faiga recalled that Sony was also creating his own guinea pig built around Spider-Man.
"So it happens that he's the only superpower hero who's found himself in all sorts of menacing.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an extract from the film "Wolf of Wall Street", in which Leonardo de Caprio's hero screams "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies came out in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted half of the cash flow from Spider-Man movies, provided that both companies paid half of the cost of painting production.
But it didn't suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from the gullible Marvel has angered many loyal fans.
The details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have cooperated well for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many of the [Spider-Man].
We're glad we can go forward together."
The film "Avengers: Finals", which brought together Spider-Man, Torah, Hulk and other superheroes Marvel, became the most cashier in the history of the world's cinema, replacing the Avatar.

In Congress, Trump and Zelensky saw a "Russian trail"
In the lower chamber of the U.S. Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of being involved in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The assumption that the Russians might somehow be behind this story was made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who is transmitting the MSNBC News.
"The Russian Federation, I believe, has attached a hand to this," said the Democrat, but did not comment further.
Democrats led by Pelosi, who hold the majority in the House, have previously announced impeachment proceedings against the President.
This happened after Trump was complained about by an intelligence informant.
The informant suspected that in a conversation with Zelensky in July Trump had put pressure on his interviewer to get Ukraine to file a case against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Biden, the latter of whom could become a rival of Trump in the elections in a year's time.
The White House had to provide Congressmen and the public with a transcript of the scandalous conversation.

The expert told me why we should give up tea in bags.
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that more than ten billion microplastics were ingested in a cup of tea in five minutes.
A piece of sawdust can also be added to the bag, says the National News food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the bagged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.
The sawdust don't throw away at the end of the season, so they might end up in tea.
"Best of all, it's not always tea plants that are included in the bags," Tikhona said.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of tea on a scale that is sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packed tea was not only in the composition but also in its production method - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"The best way to buy pure green or black tea is to have the least supplement in such a drink," the expert pointed out.

Regions were invited to share their business support secrets.
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister for Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, inviting him to express his views on the initiatives of the Federation entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It's time to build interregional links.
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy compiled information from the regions on their business development and self-employment programmes and the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions explained to the senators the problems of SME development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
"To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all the regions visited by senators has identified the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes in the country as a whole", Andrei Kutepov noted.
In an annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of regional good practices on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of proposals and issues from the regions (available for revision).
In addition to the line ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on good practices in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to provide information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the parliamentary newspaper Senator.
Useful experience
Small and medium-sized business support programmes have now been adopted and successfully implemented in many regions of the country.
For example, the Vologoda Region has an Entrepreneurship Support Centre, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanov region, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of one window through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar province, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the provincial budget.
The Orlov region has a cluster development centre.
The Amur region, under the federal project "Axleration of Small and Medium Business Entities", provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established on the basis of existing non-State covorking centres from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have adopted special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangelian region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "business activities", as this "is the most consistent with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanov region, amendments should be made to expand the range of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including the management and repair of accommodations, long-term buildings and physical training sessions.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen the control of unfair dairy producers through the Mercury Veterinary System.
In the Kostrom and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship are promoted in the legal and regulatory framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills", Andrei Kutepov assured.
The airline helped the passengers avoid living next door to crying children.
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on the plane, you can now find out where the little kids will be sitting.
Now, if you want to live next door with them, you can avoid them.
Japan Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid an unwanted neighbourhood with young children.
The aircraft carrier has set up a function to track where the children will be sitting.
In the course of booking, passengers will be able to see the picture of the child ' s head on the ground, which is occupied by children between the ages of eight days and two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying can be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the services of the airline are encouraged by the innovations.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do likewise.
One of the lasers complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago and had three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of "youth-only flights", expressing willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they see nothing pleasant about flying near a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman travelling with a baby tried to encourage her travellers on the flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each with an apology note.

On the walls of the wagons, you can see rare archival images and images of films.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the Moscow cause.
Pavel Ustinov joined a series of "Free All" single pickets, which take place on Friday outside the Russian President's office in the Old Square in Moscow, and is being broadcast by Interfax.
The picket series began on 18 September in support of the Ustin itself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the participants in the event, in succession, stand by holding a sign with the inscription "Free All" and the names of the convicted and arrested persons after the unconfirmed meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster, the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Daniel Begletz, Eugenia Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Idar Gubaydulin, Alexeya Minialo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Rajabova, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyszewski, Vladislav Sinitsa.
On 16 September, the Tver Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years ' imprisonment in a general-security colony on charges of violence against a member of the OMO on Rosgwardia at an unconfirmed action on 3 August in the centre of Moscow (art. 318, para. 2).

According to Interfax Sister Ustinova Julia, her brother is not planning to speak at the 29 September rally in the capital in support of the Moscow case.
The supply of "sanctions" to Russia has fallen 100 times.
In the Russian Government, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared to 3 million 442,200 tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
However, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
These are supplies of goods that have not been embargoed.
According to the report, the loss of prohibited imports was offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
It will be recalled that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official legal portal, it was noted that the rules had been extended for one more year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially, products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada were subject to a sanctions destruction order.
Since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine have joined this list.
Putin's decree on the destruction of illegally imported "sanctions" (products under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the West's anti-Russian sanctions) came into force in 2015.
The Government, in turn, allowed the destruction of "sanction" food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
However, products imported by citizens for personal use are not subject to this measure.
The prohibition does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
