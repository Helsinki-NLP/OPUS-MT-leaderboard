Parliament does not support the amendment allowing Timoshenko freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to repeal an article condemning the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years ' imprisonment for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unfavourable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Libyan victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Qadhafi is buried somewhere in the desert without him, the war is over.
It's time to identify the winners.
In general, Islamists are defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a successor to the customary law of Chariyat, which we have heard about.
Libya will become a country without crime, since the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women may forget emancipation; potential perpetrators will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
In Libya, there will be order that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
In any event, our way of life is neither the only one of our kind nor the best and most likely not the people of Libya, for example.
Indeed, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that they consider NATO's raids to be governed not by an American general, but by Allah, whose glory they glorify after every strike.
And if there are winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians have been spared the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of the "cityrs."
Although without occupation, will oil companies receive Libyan black gold for almost no price?
And then the West will finally be able to puke the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless Chariath's followers put an end to this.
A new wave of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are now at the centre of investors ' attention.
The statistical storm took place over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
Still, the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary economic development assessments in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP grew by expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted data for the second quarter, where Germany has gone better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the original information meant stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, which confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts ' projections.
Greece ' s economy showed a preliminary 5.2 per cent decline.
The value of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The value of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return of Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech Assembly was selected for EURO.
In Montenegro, they won at 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million prize.
The National Team has successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful throat of Peter Yiracek, they won at 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after the domestic response, and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and produced a detailed report.
There's practically nothing remarkable about the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yirac; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the entrance to the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed Montenegro's team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Veachic became the most unfortunate couple of games after they missed two great opportunities.
The great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly won't miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech Football will make about CZK 200 million.
Since the first few minutes, the game has been very tense.
Both teams experienced difficulties in combining; the game was in the middle of the field most of the time.
It also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first time.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a human shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, after the students' prayers before entering the building, they prayed for the death of both the US and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its last report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all evidence indicated that Iran had not left an attempt to acquire nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, after the students' prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, the U.S. and Israel both died.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of Iran ' s nuclear programme, the objectives would be, according to the Israeli press, to install uranium enrichment facilities in both Isfahan and Natanza.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between 9 and 13 years of age weigh more than the norm; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren have an extra weight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families that lead to unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and patterns of conduct associated with the human being for his or her healthy development.
For example, the sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity had eaten fries for dinner prior to the survey on educational activities called obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but this is true for most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of children said that their parents find time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 primary school pupils throughout Bohemia.
It was not an accident for a second year in a row, with the support of Všeobecná zdravatní pojišăvna and Unilev.
To date, more than 12,000 students from grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Adequate nutrition and sufficient sporting pressures are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either excessive weight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they eat five meals a day, according to the luncheon meal scheme, and this is one of the non-preliminary nutritional conditions" says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch or sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the regular time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families eat breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats separate breakfasts.
The worst discovery was that people in every tenth family don't eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study showed that hot food was used more frequently in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure decreases more than twice - to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Set up your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to develop their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 years of age are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of tormented, meaty and sweet meals.
"The great popularity of sweet cool drinks is a matter of great alarm, " says the final part of the study.
As the main lunch meal, the pasta defeated a bird with a slight overweight.
However, children have shown little interest in beans, fish and vegetable meals.
The desire for a healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children were willing to change their habits in food provided they were provided with relevant information.
"A large number of participants in the study's review team have shown a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after the completion of the lecture on obesity is not an accident," the outcome of the project is stated.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks, more children have opted for water.
In addition, children were more likely to see bird and fish as the main meal, limiting the number of sweet meals and bakes.
Stilist should also be a good psychologist, claiming to be professionals.
In the first article on training for stylists, I visited the volume of information in introductory sessions.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and seminar on how all of this works in real life.
It's more than that.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we expect.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alain, Director, (no man knows) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, another boy's figure without proper shapes, another one weighs more than the norm.
The stylist should know how to simplify the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer López, i.e., the owners of the more boring breasts and thighs and a narrow waist, without wearing them too much.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and thigh is so great that you can't pick up a skirt or a pants, it's worth at least one thing that's on order.
You're obviously not gonna regret the investment, because perfect sitting clothes are priceless.
In an order skirt, you'll feel much better than the one that always moves, rolls, exposes the waist, etc.
The boys ' figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with their backs, application, stitches or warehouses.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two sets for a celebrity: a day and a evening.
We need to take into account their modern appearance, their style of clothing and the type of figure.
I'm gonna have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know on Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself, because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered to a ton (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating) or very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut our clothes out of the magazines or find it online, print and process it through graphic programs.
Mudbord - that's what the result of the work is - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It's important to keep the graphic component of the style in your head.
Stilist not only dresses real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what a stylist and designer Mario Kamenick told us about.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist needs general knowledge.
A Saturday lecture filled with information about the types of figures was given by three guests who were specialists in this field.
Stilist, Honza Pochorna; fashion designer, Yakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist must take advantage of this fact.
A good stylist can use one piece of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat coach can be worn in a normal way, tops of jeans and t-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body without a strap like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
" Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I'd like to say the following: "You should know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them, ' told us Yakuba.
Here I finally figured out why we're dentalizing all the definitions and rules, which combined with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see a different one.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I found out that the stylist must have more options for dressing than the number of photos he needed to take.
Okay, for a fashion view on ten pages (equivalent to ten dresses), I have to be prepared to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that in the picture, clothes often look and work in combination with others is not exactly the same as in reality.
We have to bear this in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pocorna confirmed that often image and style is half success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing vocal, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of the stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often think it's more than that (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, or what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to call us a different size (less) than the one they really wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about some celebrity ceiling/daughter, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for the stilist to get into fashion and be able to pick up the dress.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to assess people, not to concede them and to hold their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her whole wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Get at least a few things you can commend, and suggest that you can wear with them" says Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be specifically included.
It's the bag you put around the waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, stickers or English pins, it must have a neural thread (tiles use it when filming certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to seal tissue on the back if the clothes are too large (blanks and similar objects are prohibited because they're ruining clothes) or a sewing kit.
To distract from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to do the right stuff on the shoe's soles.
Even during the studio shooting, where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged, not to mention shootings on the street.
And here's the sticker.
You don't have to touch the scissors' shoes to prevent them from ruining them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy to say.
V Need for Speed: Escape is taking place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk turned into a routine internal trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were met to a certain extent, but it doesn't matter because no one clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before leaving the new version with the headline "Bleeping", there was a great deal of hope.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of race games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero came out of the car and ran.
As is often the case with the NFS, it's a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a rather good archcad race, but the general impression is that there are several unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for several years.
Which means it's not really a mistake, it's a manifestation of an unexplained loop of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're becoming part of a story whose main hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has a few interesting features.
The route consists of ten steps divided into more than fifty races.
This means that every race passes its route, separate stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is nice to see some tracks.
Still, the game doesn't cause strong emotions.
While driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs or high in snowy mountains are very pleasant.
In addition, the race gives rise to an unusual detail from time to time.
For example, in the desert, you enter a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
Individual races are rather well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you're trying to beat up a few rivals (in essence, a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (standard race with a second-timer); or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you go from time to time to the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of Jack's time runs from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game, because it's not annoying; given all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more exciting.
The mining model follows previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a simulation of real life, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far, it's very good.
However, problems are beginning some time later.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't that good.
You don't expect a complex change and a collision from this game, but if you have no idea what you're gonna do before you hit the target, how your car's gonna behave, something's wrong.
Usually, driving or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch a little bit of another car, and sometimes, in a very similar situation, your car starts to get mad.
Or it broke.
It's not that important because of the restarting system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
Restarts are arranged so that if you break or go far from the track, the game brings you back to the point where she broke up.
However, only five re-entrys are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes re-entry isn't enough, and you've got to learn a separate section of the race.
An important weakness in the game is the fact that the same things often occur in the same places.
For example, some turns have to go through in a certain way, or you just won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It's particularly annoying in situations where you see your rival passing easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you're in there, the cars are already located so that you need to either leave them or drop their speed.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; it's arranged that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find a few places where, regardless of time, the same rival chases you in the same place.
It's particularly obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand before you, no matter what.
The thing is, when he's in front of you, he's making you look worse, leading to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand an attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get annoyed quickly.
I'm sorry, because despite the simple driving model, the game is busy and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't let you miss the concept of 50 unique paths, the sequence of races, or anything else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the refuellings on the way, because they're the ones your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are suitable for direct highway cuts; and exotic super-ports for technical driving, for example, by curved mountain routes.
The main mode of the story mode is closely linked to the challengege mode regime; it's a race on individual sites that you will learn from the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal case both medals and glasses common to the challenges and story regimes.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving levels, from machines to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with those of other players and provides public relations.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (so let's say) where you're going through the tracks in the dark (to be counted as that).
Your speedometer shows the figures from 150 to 200 km/h (to be considered) when a subway train suddenly hits you in the back, turning your car into a scrap metal chest.
For a few days, we've been discussing whether no one really thought at the time of the game, or whether its creators really think we're such a jerk.
The technical content of the game is not very special; but the general impression of the video is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
While it is regrettable that, in some critical moments, the quality of the record is sometimes quite high, the quality of the record is declining.
This is especially true of a large number of participants, where a good recording wouldn't help you much, either.
Sound's fine; soundtrack is on the amateur.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, the soundtrack "becomes of different style," but hardly a lot of people buy a game because of her music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is rather indiscriminate.
If the game had avoided a manifestly unnecessary error, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of unfinishedness.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but prepare for the shortcomings to blind you as a lighter for the airport.
The University of Karlov Hawls will attend the Barhat Student concert.

Ambassador to the EU of Vicenova:
The Czechs have the reputation of unbroken and skeptics vis-à-vis the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war to happen."
"It'll take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milen Wissenov has begun his lecture in law school.
She demonstrated how much she followed her motto "Nearly and Open About Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and relations between them so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the law faculty of the CU would be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
"At first the critics said he was just a gray office mouse that couldn't perform any role; I have to say, everyone was struck by how well he did his part."
"He is a person who can listen simultaneously to twenty-seven participating countries to communicate with them well and has a clear idea of where to develop the EU."
She explained her new position as representative of international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I have to call?" that is, an important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
The stage continued to focus on a programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the successful Czech presidency last year.
The Czechs had dealt with the impending financial crisis; they had overcome that crisis and had organized an East Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time had been a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
At present, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused a continuing setback.
In addition, a new EU seven-year budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and what less; all those issues would be in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "O Europe, I understand the language."
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words, and a roast that no one understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people don't try to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's gonna ban our cheese varieties.'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs consider Euro-skeptics; as well as people who are more negative than positive.
She wanted more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is the responsibility of several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; while there is little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Vishegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary and join us with the word, the French next to me says, "Hey, what's the meeting about, again the Visgrad Group?" And he's not happy about it."
In the future, the Vicenova Union is mainly awaiting new strict rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, to be more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"First, it was said that countries that wanted to come together should be united, while those who did not want could stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be truly a two-speed Europe," awaits Vicenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The IBM innovation is entering the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is likely to be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's debt was laid by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, the oldest.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumai!" thus became a stamp around which the future giant's life was unfolding (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a steady move towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she wasn't afraid to change everything around herself.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says the current head of Samuel J. Palmizano's company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s Watson approached the issue of caring for employees, just as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first US employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer, elegant uniforms and a complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is also advanced.
From the very beginning, the company has been brilliantly using talented people, which was one of the first world companies to eliminate all the discrimination that gave her a great choice.
Agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the director of sales, marketing and development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, where many future innovations are emerging.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas -- about half a million people work in the company.
Organization with good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in business is ensured by strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, from the point of view of the IBM concept, was rather an organization, not a technology company," told the Economist, Professor Harvard Business School, and author of the book on IBM Rosebeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve technology-based business problems," adds Joj Colony from Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as they call it in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It appears that this is the most universal technology company, the hardware and software development company; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her employees received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first in Apple) by overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all of its products came to the buyer's taste and fit into the era, for example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; the online Prodigy service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by the move forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM makes it easy to lay foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it refuses them.
It is different from, for example, its competition Microsoft, which is based and is experiencing falls on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
The main income of IBM comes from services, about one-fifth of each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, the capital was twice as small, it was the strongest manufacturing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, while it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the Great Depression years.
Until then, IBM seems to have caused no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM stock price has increased by record 120 per cent; the company ' s net earnings have steadily increased.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its own values.
So it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant can handle the situation.
History of IBM: from a cheese knife to a space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name, the Corporation of Calculations, Tabulations, Records, was quite complicated.
It was named IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were built by a merger of four companies, whose history began in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "tube watches," i.e. hours that record the time when staff come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Runlet Flint, a businessman who also chaired the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competitor company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then moved the founder of IBM into the shadow of Watson's ideas as the basis of unbelievable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as it is clear from the name, starts from the production and sale of various business equipment, from the raw knives and meats to the cashiers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, the proceeds doubled to $9 million, and a large expansion of the company began on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took over his seat in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights - Mercure, Saturn, and 1969 - a human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the Chinese company Lenovo computers while buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently presented the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in central and eastern Europe simultaneously, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research group is also working to recognize speech.
Richtarjova about his wrong husband:
Iveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarjova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarge (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošova (45), Darina was still hoping that he would wake up and come home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has laid down clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can go home, but no longer as my partner," explained Richtarjov.
When Darina Richtarjova gave Bartošova's house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Eve to leave Rjichan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she's finally forgiven him.
Richtarju doesn't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartošov ever broke up, his wife wouldn't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out."
"One day he'll end his days not like my favorite, lost and found old fool, but the man I've been tied up with" said Richtarjov, adding that she's already released from her husband and insists only on two decency.
Until Josef had anything against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not gonna change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance continues to function; I am responsible for repairs, gardens, houses and shopping."
"Darina and I talk perfectly normal, but we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge to Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarjov finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We're not sleeping together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a buddy with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst women's habits: Are they touching you?
When you ask men to name some typical poor women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the next row, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains you're going shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
And yet, which one of you will refuse to walk through the clothing shops in search of perfect sitting clothes and to try it (desiredly, in different colours) in exemplarys?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it could be a living hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half of a woman to wait outside for you...
It's a lot of disillusionment.
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five kilos, maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Do you still bring it to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who've been obsessed with your appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men literally have allergies about constant partner complaints about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women get annoyed.
Most important is order and purity.
It's like an endless story.
Mouse of glass, dust cleaning, floor washing, dust washing, bath cleaning - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for coming to a clean cafe in dirty shoes; children for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room, which was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this "demotion," try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that in your family, order and purity should not stand first.
A harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
The desire to command
"Give your underwear to the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"The wet towels for the dishes shall not lie on the floor."
If you're making comments to your partner several times a day, he might think it's very boring.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Smells
Some women like to gossip, insult and splash intrigue against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, how and why.
From time to time, maybe each of us is spreading gossip.
Let's be frank, it seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women ' s working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The results of Yagra and the Doctor helped Philadelphia win.
During the NLL game on Monday, two successful hits of the hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Caroline's ice, and again became the most effective Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giro took advantage of the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
Two successful matches also belonged to a player on the same team with Yagorg Yakubu Doctorek.
After the game, Yagra told foreign journalists that he predicted Gira was a great evening.
"I told him before the match that he was gonna kill a hit-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like this," explained Yagra, after whose actions Giro scored the goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later than the second goal of the team also had a "cheech trail."
The closing Harrickines Voorek has taken over the rayboy and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who got caught between circles.
One second before the first break of the house player, Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with the numerical advantage, but Flyers again started the second time.
Especially Giru.
After the successful launch of the Yagra, he scored the third goal; later his impact was transformed into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said Yagra, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years at the NHL, my teammates have tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Games.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruut and the penalty Duyer, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications prevented Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger acted great in our zone."
"He hit the seabe, I accelerated, and Reid went to the far edge."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," I described Varocek's impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the East Conference.
The protector of the Montreal Chech team, Jaroslav Spachek, did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the injury of the upper body.
With an experienced lawyer, Kanadiens lost his two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomas Plexan was unable to beat one of their attacks.
More than lost glasses, the home coach was upset by the high number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We've only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Anyway, we can't do anything about it, we just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement for replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to make the game easier, move the ball out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K. Subban's protector.
After 30 attacks, the Czech Holquiper Onjay Pavelec helped Vinnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
Jets' heads, who interrupted the five-match episode, were beaten by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourism agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at that time were mostly selling tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crime on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., Czechoslovakia and Czechoslovakia) had not been allowed to travel individually in socialist countries.
If a Czech citizen wanted to go on his own, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; another individual journey was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have good friends at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was necessary to travel to the West and was not granted to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit, it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) to travel to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their home leave, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that continues to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989, the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware is that, until 1989, we were unable to freely visit Croatia, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for a visa to neighbouring Western European countries was cancelled, starting with a huge wave of short travel, mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't afford to travel to the West, everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tents in parks, as their revenues at the time lacked a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring food (conserves, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a free convertible Czech crown, and decades later our tourists can finally buy Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines, as compared to the past, air flights have now become incredibly cheap owing to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the US, making our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution took place in 2000 and the great demand led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have transported Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will be sent in twelve exotic directions.
At present, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important development of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. cancelled the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus permanently joined the world ' s most developed countries.
For the first time in history, in 2008 Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3 per cent); for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during their leave abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly must choose the president, the threat of the path returns.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there is a risk that the successor, Ivan Gašek, head of the Czech Football Association (FACHR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general assembly, which will take place in Nimburke on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without this, one of the three candidates will not vote.
Yindrzhih Rihl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Petzlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and he called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong identity that would lead football in the future.
However, Gachec's era once again loaded football in a race between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became clear on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the National House in Prague, Sichov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly - only legal representatives or officials who had been granted authority.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights that representation based on the authority granted cannot be achieved.
Disputes about electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not been too helpful, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly concerned with this issue.
The voting modalities have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we move on to the third round and avoid the path?
"The argument is whether to follow the established standards or to find another model," says a Vice-President, FACHR Dushanbe, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for in the statute, the winner of the third round is the candidate who has received the greatest support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to compromise - to consider the winner of the election the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that at least two thirds of the votes should be obtained in the overall percentage of the winner.
"At least the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; that would totally reject the concept of two chambers," freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Some surprise Tomás Petzlik agrees with his opinion, although the rules of the election, as defined by the statute, are estimated to be more suitable for Peltu than for other candidates.
"I'd like the election to take place as far as possible."
"I want to avoid all possible representational foolishness, as in the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzeen, who is the first candidate; and in his remarks, he was largely contrary to Pellet.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburke; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"Every emotional broach will calm down after today's expected national team to the European Championship."
"Futball will be back on the happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonitz, of the three candidates, who have the greatest experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Ryhl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This could cause another disruption of the general assembly."
"I hope that common sense wins," said Rihl.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach agreement.
According to some reports, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be delivered in addition to others, by the Vice-Presidents, Dahil Kucher and Rachel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure, seeking an alternative to bring part of the executive committee to the venue of the re-emerging match.
After all, a ministerial meeting that is expected on Wednesday can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like the opposing parties to reach an agreement within the country ' s strongest sports association.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech Sports Director following the financial problems of Sazka.
The pilot is in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If, before the Extraordinary General Assembly, the head of footballers, Plzeen Tomas Petzlik, had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even sought a high office.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I'd fight for him and I wouldn't have fought for him myself."
"But this man hasn't yet been found," said Patzlik ČTK.
Patzlik's motive to join the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrzhih Raihl is to try to prevent Pelte, who is believed to be a favourite of the election, from entering the FACHR administration.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain President until 2013 when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be an experienced top manager, not too connected to football life.
"I've spoken to a few people you might have in mind."
"It was awful for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, Pazzlik's main disagreement with Pelta is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbro, President of the Regional Football Association in Plesen, and Berb is a man of controversial reputation, known behind the scenes as a powerful lobby that can influence the voices of the delegates of the general assembly.
Patzlik thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, capable of a businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," Pazzlick said.
He suggests that a few years ago the name of Pelta was recorded during the phone hearing in the corruption investigation; Pelte managed to avoid a sentence.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would bring football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlik, and now he doesn't mention his old saying that he will "sell the Plesin Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Patzlitz wins Thursday, he could imagine working with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Raichl, who was supported by Patzlik before the general assembly in September, which ended the fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can imagine him at the head of the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't take my nose into anything I don't know about either, ' said Patzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of the judicial team led by Lucot Macella, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
He claims he'll risk running an association.
He referred to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he had run a team of Plzeen, which, with his help, had celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to appalling situations," Patzlik said, he does not hide his antipathy, such as Sparta's director Daniel Krjetin.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that a new president should address."
"If taxes are taxed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money is going, " he said.
He does not consider his connection to the Plzeen Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to Yablonek, and Rihl's with the Prague Duclos.
"It's not the perfect option."
"And yet I don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to someone else's club, since I'm going to go back there in six months," says Patzlik.
Pelta promised new FACHR rules that would avoid the elected Pata.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FACHR rules in order to avoid disputes over the rules of election in the future.
Prior to the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburke, the Yablonitz functioner remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the campaign will significantly distract today ' s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment in front of the last general assembly, a two-month delay so that he could be useful to stand up to his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been at football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead an association," claims a man, mainly associated with the Jablet Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is sufficiently experienced to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gasek's reign.
"Sorry, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the different ways of representation had not been accepted, we would have had a president since September," Pelt said.
He referred to the translation of a key civil association document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt is unsuccessful."
"It's a fundamental question without which we can't exist," Pelt claims.
Besides, he says he's not trying to identify himself against rivals.
In the past, he has already stated that he can present his cooperation with Yindrjih Raichl, whom he values for legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's in football for over a year, and he's made some progress."
"In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people surprised his campaign methods."
"And so some of them are now questioning his true identity," Pelt said about his rival, and Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon to be football knowledge, from competitions at the lowest level to national assembly.
The national team should represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the goddess or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," a 40-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'm gonna need to know the official instructions of individual staff." It was his message to the Insurance, where the prolonged period of inter-government is causing a clear nerve.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the planned general assembly, he believed that on Thursday delegates would come to Nimburk in vain.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Futball needs the trust he can gain only by finally electing his leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his functional career, remains optimistic.
Rychl promises to be active in his leadership FACHR.
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Yindrjih Rihl, the current Vice-President, is to be president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are rumoured to be unhappy.
Rachel promises that if he gets elected, there's gonna be a time of hard work.
He wanted to make changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the problem of goddesses; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue with the work of the previous President, Ivan Gasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national assembly, professional football and youth football activities."
"I don't want to say I'm gonna do it myself," said Rachel in his interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to share the powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I will carefully divide the tasks so that each of these segments of football takes great steps forward."
"It probably won't like a lot of people, because it's gonna mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"Oh, I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Even less, many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't give up," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to strike it all off."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could go back to what was before Gašek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta is capable of."
"He's surrounded by people who would do football so that he can only be available to the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I'm definitely not subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he refutes the allegations that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Though many people try to say otherwise, I plan to do maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rihl.
While Plesen Tomas Petzlik's management team joined the presidential struggle, Rihl is not dared to assess his chances of winning.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Rachel, and to his success, he takes the savings of tens of millions of kroner on unusable contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
He claims that Pelta was "deleted from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football," and he thinks he's another rival, Pazzlica, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job at Plesene this year."
"If he is chosen, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gaschek began without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," said Rachel about his rival.
The most beautiful basins in Europe
Jump in the water.
Julia Stanek
Children's swimming pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest, travelers can try Europe's incredible water, and relax the tired body in the Jacuzzi after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder has been unable to cope with his research visits for the last and a half years: without his bathing suit.
On her back in the water, she looked up at the taste of a finished dome, sailed to the marble haruvims, waiting at the edge of the basin, and she loved the carefully retreaded al-navo swimming pools.
She was in a hurry to add every enjoying pool to her notebook, with important details about the building's construction and history.
Meder's architecture has seen more than 200 swimming basins - and has now gathered the impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, where everything went, from the public basins in Munich to the historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunas.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she travelled to the Czech Republic, France, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and to one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real bath culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that swimming fans must tolerate blue cafeteria and chlorine smell, while runners can breathe a lousy smell of tail forests or listen to the joyous bird chips in the park.
"One time I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible," says the Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles architecture
Plumbing in the pool and refined oils in the sauna are a healthy factor in the bathtubs, because according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eye if the builders do so. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visible: high ceilings, colour plate and trample.
The illustrated edition of the "Payability of Buying" on 190 pages provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasis - and gives you a desire to jump into the water.
The Meder Water Collection found several outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
It found abundant nitrate water in the carste cave (Micolz-Tapolce Reserve) and a thermal bath filled with alkalin water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberen), as well as excellent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year bathtubs of Secheni in Budapest.
From many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you can see the whole Zurich from the roof bath or look at the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steamhouse that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for merchants in Langenfeld, and the Aqua Cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO just landed in Alps.
In winter, a couple of three open shells appear to be very small in the midst of the Etztal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwartzwald
Meder basin gatherer didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
There's a lot of thermal baths smell like gray, and Arpad's food in Bekescub smells so much oil, that you might find it hard to believe that you're in a healthy source.
The smells cause hydrocarbonates in the alkalin water, water almost black from the needle that sticks to the skin as soon as you get into the pool - a healthy experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open pool of the Czech bathtub in Lugachovitz, she discovered that the territory was sealed.
The dolls, designed by the architect Dushan Jürkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the visible windows of the red, white and yellow building in the style of an arvoto, she saw the weeds growing between the cafeteria plates.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks was an amazing swimming pool in Schwartzwald, the Berthal Water Palace in Bad-Wildbad.
The Basseynes have already passed through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the post-construction period in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Hall in the Algambra style, added around 1900.
After careful renovation in 1995, the Termal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder basin, not just because it comes from Schwartzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so mastery to combine these different architectural buildings," says Meder.
Sticking into a thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary occupation.
Agricultural speculation
The Doiche Bank is investigating agricultural trade.
Christian Tivs
Will the Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the world ' s poor.
The Executive Director plans to change in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks bake in agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Bank and other banks cease agricultural trade, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world ' s poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study carried out by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the game of world commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against the head of the Doich Bank of Josef Akkermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are selling the same thing.
Initially, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that players have abandoned supply and demand rules - and are at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism, he promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade was "not worth risking the good reputation of Doyche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLY, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods can decrease or stop altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was encouraged by the news, emphasizing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The pressure on rising food prices is a blatant example of how banks are now acting against common interests."
As the bank's main lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain obligation, according to Bode.
"The Bank must remove from the portfolio all the investments that make money for food prices," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's about hungry people or Doyle Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's rapid reaction is surprising at first, but the Director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before his stay in the office.
Doiche Bank announced on Monday that the president would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
Nor does he need to take care of the costs - the consequences will have to be dealt with by his successor.
One in two would give up on investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, a study for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on 7 and 8 November and 1,001 participants.
No more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make the price of food are acceptable to Doyche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such trade, and according to the study, each second would withdraw the deposits that ultimately lead to speculation.
Forty-three percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they'd think about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
Pavilion's in a new place.
Ingeborg Winsowski
==History==The architectural story, with its rises, falls and happy endings, was won by the Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's open again as a exhibition center.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, which have been bold to express their faith in technological progress.
==History==Pavilion Schwanzer won Grand Prix by architecture in 1958 for his lightly steaming structure from steel and glass.
Building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World Expo.
After all, he became famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a building in the form of a cup.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss garden near the Southern Vena station, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962, often referred to as the 20th century House for this reason.
In any case, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which works of art could be hanged, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna had received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
The architect Adolf Krishnittz has now re-established the pavilion, which was called the 21st Century House, and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belveder Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night - in every sense a happy event.
Agnes Hussein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new beginning.
Hussein Arco, a professor of art history with a brilliant career as a figure in youth who worked in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became founder and director of the Modernity Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was supposed to include a permanent exhibition of the Fitz Wharbuba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art, and an office building was also to be built.
Strict control " limited budget "
Krishnittz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, thanks to the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrih, and won the competition, but he also studied at Swanzer University of Vienna Technology, and the pavilion was "exceptionally important" where he visited the exhibitions "almost every week."
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered in the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was a "power sink," says Krishantitz.
The windows on the glass facade were replaced, a reinforced glass fibre safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-velocity safety glass.
The thermal bridge has been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos has been removed from the ceiling.
The two lower floors have created space for the new use of the building, and the luminous well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still the elegant pavilion of the Schwanzer.
The original outer doors were kept, and the building was painted in the old red brown colour of corrosion protection.
The movie theater hall is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of the museum office and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would have been approved by the museum office," says Kryshanitz, pointing to the uneven in the basement.
The building remains flexible and easy despite limitations, problems and transformation.
Kryshanitz recently observed that the diamond pavilion from Brussels was a rude, typical story of "a drop in the city."
This architecture is "at all times not in its place" and nevertheless wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st century house is in a very right place, because there was unexpected luck in planning the city, and the completely restructured main station apartment with offices and housing is growing around the Swiss garden.
The house of the 21st century can be supplemented by the second building of Krishantitz, a collector of Francesca von Gabsburg, purchased the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and reportedly negotiates with the city about his neighbour in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million winter crisis package.
Deutsche Bahn released a crisis plan to avoid the replacement of trains in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year in order to avoid winter departures and late trains.
Referring to the Deutsche Bahn internal crisis plan, Bild reported that a total investment of about 300 million euros was planned before 2015.
Investments are intended to improve the performance of locomotives and rail networks even under extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff engaged and engaged in snow cleaning from the tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice to start work and 90 per cent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of replacing and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting approval by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axis much more frequently over many years after one of the ICE trains had broken the axis at the main station in Kelne.
Douche Bank will pay millions of pounds a fine in the United States.
The new troubles followed the unrest around Joseph Akkermann, Director General Doich Bank: Doyche Bank faces a fine in the United States of America for a lot of millions of pounds.
As if Doich Bank had little problems in his home country, the past industrial giant in the United States had now raided him, and the bank with its headquarters in Frankfurt would pay $145 million (Euro106 million) to calm down the disputes that had arisen after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose over the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The bond value fell sharply during the financial crisis and pushed down credit unions.
"We're glad to have solved this problem without the parties applying to the court," said the representative of Doich Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not plead guilty.
The same is true for the Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the rapid reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting for damages that come out of billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage pool.
They're supported by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble broke into the U.S. real estate market in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 in the middle of a financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators filed a large number of claims requesting compensation or punishment of fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having acquired some $200 billion in collateral agreements from US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank ' s Doiche is also at risk of prosecution by FHFA for numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank with a headquarters in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for "existing losses" but not yet to specify the exact amount.
The Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM.
Buffett's financial company is actively investing in IBM IT.
Since March, he has bought shares totalling more than $10 billion.
So far, Warren Buffett, the largest American investor, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffett, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment was seen as a knight's act.
IBM, the IT veteran, has now acquired the title "sir IBM."
In an interview with the American business television channel CNBC Buffett reported that since March he had acquired IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway was one of the largest IBM shareholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He commended the management that had been able to earn profits even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," Buffett said, with a management strategy.
IBM has focused much time on high-income IT services such as date centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has now been over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
Buffett's been avoiding technology companies so far.
He claimed to invest only in companies he understood.
and invested, for example, in freight rail, lubricant production and machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in the long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world ' s most expensive companies through intelligent investments.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
By making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct in making money brought him the name Oracula of Omaha.
The value of IBM shares increased by one per cent prior to the opening of markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, stands on a stock exchange of over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Indefinite danger
Following the discovery of the Tswickau cell, the Turkish media began to question the authority of the law in Germany.
One newspaper talks about the "blood ideology" that is now going back to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have responded to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears, such right-wing attacks on Turks have not occurred since the arson in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a magnitude that is not yet fully understood.
"The emergence of blood ideology?" was the headline of the Internet version of the Turkish newspaper Huberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services, and expresses concern that German authorities may be involved in right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted quietly, citing victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Berlin Turkish Community celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was a slap. "The gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X," which comments on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition of Hürryet did not miss this parallel either.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of column Ahmet Külahji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and work made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany have been killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid were strongly criticized in the German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought about monitoring suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsy, migrants will have no choice other than armed self-defence."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network will be opened and on the legality of punishment," says Selen.
Crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example that peace in Germany was threatened.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply sealed in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turks so clearly living here that they are at risk and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press, at that time, condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kol refused to visit survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the arson in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kincel-Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Kelne to calculate the taxes the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's determined the value of a man by taxes that he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how many German Turks have since become more distrustful of the current German State.
Clearly, what needs to be done now is beyond the efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal in the Lake of Zurich
Most of Europe ' s leading risky policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has barely failed during the financial crisis, and since then has been struggling with one, another crisis.
Now the German must take him back to the right course.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he'd get that part.
In July, following his effective departure from the position of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin to work at the equally effective position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank of UBS; unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously excited, praised Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for his newly established strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Phillip and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that everything would be completely different.
The UBS tracker in London went through bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The UBS Executive Director, Oswald Grabella, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the board of directors of UBS has been treated as sick, and everyone wants to know when Alex Weber will finally take office?
Weber has been required to advise the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will be presiding over the board by May instead of 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He is a professor of the economy and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will certainly need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the Bank's strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the title of "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, a very big one - until recently, he managed the largest assets in the world - and on the other hand, for years, he hasn't come out of scandals.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank has nothing to spare.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Up to 2007, UBS had a beautiful reputation.
The Bank has combined the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time a sneaky asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in the investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007 with more money to manage wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he entered the league of the world's largest banks.
It was an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains: "I have always given my students UBS as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that there was something going on at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to assume why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play subprime securities and had to write down billions.
Believe me, you don't want to, but UBS reported an increase of SwF 13 billion to counter the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers have recently been politely denied - one very non-transparent Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, hidden so much that even its name has not been disclosed.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, things became much worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second in terms of salary level, the chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
There was a disaster in October 2008 because of the lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, the State had to save him.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic securities for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory envelope to become a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences that huge banks had settled in a small country.
After all, the final balance of UBS in 2007 was five times greater than all Swiss production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second catastrophe came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that he was willing to transmit data to wealthy customers who might have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus acknowledged more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what had always been his advantage in fighting for rich clients - a veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
Started with the money of the clients.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activity - investment due to poor speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the encouragement of tax evasion.
The only thing that's calmed down, and it seemed like UBS was able to break the situation as it happened with the coroner-tracker, and one single tradingman dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office has not yet worked.
"Adoboli's incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, Professor of Economics and Finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: "The UBS problem is that he has no risk control tool."
It was caution that Swiss bankers had long made the custodians of the world ' s largest assets - not an excessive risk, but security for money, whether or not the world had collapsed outside the Republic of Alpine or not.
The Swiss banks' safes have become a symbol of imperceptible reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli represent a sophisticated taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank - only a little more.
Her location is a classic in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow hats of Swiss mountains.
The buildings are luxury here, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Some of the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli can be found here by jewellery such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Credi Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Bar.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather couchs along the marble walls, near the bank's emblem, a large sign "Safe."
UBS knows what his clients need is reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, abandoned Swiss concepts about banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he also works with the two largest banks.
He thinks that UBS has become too big, particularly in an investment bank, where the English masks are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, then they've been adapting to English-speaking customs for a long time."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed UBS, brought him the first big profits - and then fiasco - that no other financial institution in Europe lost so much money in subprime estate jungles as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a seven million-person small country launched the largest rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lucas Hassig in her book Krah UBS.
The politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
If you ask Swiss banks, they'll say the problem is basically UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
It was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS were complementary to each other, one being a rich but step bank specialized in the management of assets in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers have suddenly gained access to a large amount of money they could use to roll a massive wheel.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, President of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, which has gone all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Ospel finally put himself on Wolffle.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
The pride is ahead of the defeat.
UBS officials remember well the meetings of board members, where Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
At that time, he led the "Turnary Table" to which banks were successful.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to do some of this.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trade.
The authorized management advisers, however, pointed to a weak position: According to what is called "permanent income" in banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS got into an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in US substandard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on US mortgages and sold them further - continuing to take risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way out of this process for a long time, UBS hasn't stopped.
UBS bought up until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already on fire, says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the height, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to bring the bank into order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
The UBS posts have become a children's game with chairs, and until today they remain unreliable.
Anyone who leads this huge bank is almost impossible.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that turns back on all existing business models.
The bank analyst Geiger already has an idea of abandoning investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not prepared to go that far.
It is clear, however, that investment activities need to be substantially curtailed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to demonstrate character and now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, is leading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably asking Axl Weber.
The only thing he still said was that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe pulls down the US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome has had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has overshadowed the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in an embryo.
The overall relief following the change of Government in Rome and Athens was not supported.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty, but now the problems are getting back on track, said Mark Lucini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges were, inter alia, on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer varied between 12,027 and 12,170 points during the bidding process.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by 1 per cent.
Nasdaq's technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading in 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 locations.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and adapted to the end of growth.
Eurostat Statistics reported that companies had made two per cent less than in the previous month in September.
This message turned American investors into skeptics. "We're not on the island, we depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to be fast hit by the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, was only able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever needed to end the crisis.
He therefore considered it too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a ten-year-old principle into the trash basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of over $10 billion raised the price of shares of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend during the bidding.
The stocks closed, almost unchanged, at $187,35.
Buffett stated that he paid an average of $170 for the action and now had a share of 5.5 per cent.
The price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 per cent.
The Bank of America stock fell by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost the rest of China's building bank's share, earning $6.6 billion.
The Bank is mainly planning to support its capital quota with a net profit from sales in order to meet stricter standards.
The Boeing aircraft manufacturer won the loss on Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-distance fixed-wing aircraft 777 series worth $18 billion.
Including an option for another 20 planes, a total of $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares were replaced by the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.
A total of 719 companies grew, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
A total of 630 companies completed their growth bidding, 1,913 fells, and 82 remained at the same level at Nasdaq at a turnover rate of 1.38 billion shares.
Thought crows fill cities
The grates are considered to be problematic birds in many places, and the experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to get out of town.
Some people love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the ravens have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but people complaining about dirt and noise are getting bigger in many localities.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on the ravens, in the city of Lehr in East Frizia, the experts argued that it was no longer possible for the Greeks to be expelled from the cities.
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for Urban Alternatives
Conservatives argued that the root of the urban problem was in the migration of particularly protected granaries, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and cutting of traditional tree nesting have made bird life difficult.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies in the city of Westphalia and in the north-west of Yevera, Dipholce, Ahim under Bremen and Lere, with more than 600 parents.
A small project to shoot the ravens in Lere caused unsolved newspaper headlines in 2005.
Criticists described the trapping of birds and their sticks as special cruelty.
"The usual movement and intimidation do not give anything." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lera.
The disruption of the nests of water lines or the cutting of trees often has undesirable consequences, as the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg said.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas."
It is only possible to scare away near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, getting rid of them isn't an option."
In isolation from surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, " says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
Combining the scare of birds from protected residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
The "information booths instead of the benzopil" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be confident to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the lives of very intelligent Greeks is provided on the information booths.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed his opinion on complaints about the noise produced by birds. "The noise provides a lot of information, and they have a lot to say to each other."
These birds' minds and laughs have come into legends, and the grancis often use not only tools to take a look at them, but they also make their own guns.
Researchers of conduct at Cambridge University recently protested a bird's mind in four glosses.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to knock on the cheek to get the larvae of the milk.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to smash the cheek.
In another experiment, a more challenging task was needed by the smarter eyes.
Researchers put a little bucket with a larvae of milk in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get the crap out of them.
But researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and use hooks to pull a bucket over a pen and get it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four Greeks have handled it already with the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro-2012.
The hopes of Bosniaks and Turks for the last minute were long overdue.
The fans of Portugal, Croatia and Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland took up the last seats in the Euro-2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the supervision of the superstar Krishtian Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1) and perfected its fifth exit to Euro after 0.0 in the first phase.
The Czechs were sufficient 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against an outsider of Montenegro after a clean victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not lose its chance by playing 0.0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Velozou (80th) scored the rest of the gols for Portugal.
The former professional player, Bundsiliga, from Wolfsburg, Zveshan Mishimovich and Captain Emyr Spachić, reduced the difference by two points due to a successful penalti on 41st minute and a 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a second yellow card on 54 minutes.
Portugal has already beaten Bosnia from the 2010 Peace Championships in South Africa.
Portugal has made a great start on the Lisbon Estadio da Los.
Ronaldo took an early start with a free hit at the gate about 30 meters away.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range abilities, from a 25-metre mark, increasing the account to 2:0.
The Bosniacs who did not open the account in the first half hour were given their first opportunity thanks to the attacker Edina Jeco.
The former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English Manchester City Championship sent the ball to the lower edge of the pin, but the ball did not cross the gate line.
Yiraek is behind Czecha.
Judge Wolfgang Sthark of Ergolding was then the focus of attention.
Following the attack on Elder Poshtigu at the Bosniac's 36th minute platoon, Starke decided that the Portuguese player faked and showed him a yellow card.
Shtark also awarded questionable penalti for playing with his hand after Fola Fabiu Kuentran - Mishimovich had carried it out.
After the break of the 2004 Vice-Champion of Europe, the account was set by four more goals.
Peter Yiracek has dispelled all the remaining doubts about the checks on 81 minutes.
The 1976 European Champions are sent to the European Championships for the fifth consecutive time.
The success was also smiled at by Coach Michael Bicke and Legioners Bundsley Michael Cadlet (Beyer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) after an error at the very beginning that could be catastrophic.
Peter Chech's gate on the 9th minute, thanks to the instantaneous reflex, prevented Tomash Sivok's potential car race.
Montenegro had the best chances when Stevan Jovetić and Dejan Damianović were on the field.
Damianovich, on 40 minutes, hit the edge of the penal scene and barely hit the goal of Chehou.
After a break, the piston saved the world-class holkyper of Cheha after the Forward FC Seoul left the field for the 50th minute.
The winning goal was hit just before the final whistle.
In the meantime, Turkey lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play better than the 0.0 in Zagreb.
Although there is no doubt now that Gus Hiddink's team coach will now free a seat on the team bench that reached third place in 2002, Croats are the fourth time in the final tour of Europe's championship.
The Turks were almost perfectly able to start in front of 31 000 viewers at the McSimir Stadium.
Seljuk Inana's long strike was hit at the counter on the seventh minute, and the attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to take the ball into the grid.
Croatia then woke up and took more control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued to play in great shape.
The Legionaries of Bundsley Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Shildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukich of the Wolfsburg team, who took the seat of Ivan Perishić from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapatoni's going to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro exit after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who already looked confident in his place after winning 4:0 in the first phase, captured leadership for the 32nd minute, thanks to Stephen Ward's neck.
Konstantin Vasiliev of the guest team compared the 57th minute account.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only on the 23rd minute Robbie Keen from Los Angeles made the first clean golf strike.
At the last moment, the Estonian Advocate was able to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The head was beaten for 32 minutes.
When Ward was defending Paul London's Holquiper, Ward found himself in the right place and, by throwing the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software producer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China over the next few years.
The company listed Dax reported on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and take thousands of people to work," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The state of 2,500 must grow up to 4,500.
The world market leader of industrial software plans to double the number of his offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Daljan.
There are about 4,000 SAP clients out of more than 176,000 worldwide in this country, experiencing economic boom.

SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustained growth based on information technology in China."
Mass killings - Human dimension
A tense and very kind new book by Peter Englund, "The Beauty and Worried: The Personal History of World War I," begins a long list of actors from whom the heart is dying.
Here's advice on how to read next: carefully cut this page and use it as a lining.
You'll meet these people very close as Mr. Englund tells you, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon, when, like one of these men and women, you'll get off the road and lose yourself in the shadow of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's written now is unusual, and he describes it quite precisely as an anti-history work.
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, trap journalists or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, "the book of what it looked like," it's about "the feelings, the impressions, the feelings and the state of the spirit."
The book Beauty and Worried drew together the experience of 20 more or less remarkable men and women on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone's gonna get prisoner, lose his hand or foot, go crazy or die.
Their lives are fascinated here as church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some will disappear at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the assumption that the First World War was only a grave spectre war in the Western Front.
"The Beauty and Worried" provides the panoramics of other theatres of war: Alp, Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall into bees; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is the fly of the cage.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war is covering the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling like an insane powder.
When there's a canonade nearby, and you're a woman and you're at home with children, will you stay here or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost no one knows what's going on and why we have to fight this war.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "implemented by guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Worried" tracks the fate of people like Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Flot of the High Seas.
Their stories are largely taken from memoirs, letters and other published material.
The stories of their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive because of Mr. Englund's small moments and dissectional details.
Many of them are about hardship and how to deal with them.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere is an erzac."
"The replacement chocolate, the fake aluminum, the unfathomable rubber, the paper bandages, the wooden buttons."
He's still talking about erzac food in Germany.
He describes "the meat of a pressed rice welded in a lamb fat (and painted by a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes packed with a tree."
He notes that there were "837 registered substitutes for meat allowed in the manufacture of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories tell of honour and courage.
One American observes the most violent thing about the war: "You feel that, after all, it's what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable wheelchairs with a cigarette and whiskey, a night newspaper or a best-seller, and to claim that this display is civilization and that under your crazy shirt with a racket, there's no barbar. "
The British soldier, on the contrary, observes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a man has accepted the idea of self - sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen before the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's awful like "a convicted man who hangs in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new types of fear.
"Confligt has become increasingly an economic competition," writes Mr. Englund, "war factory."
He notes the coming of someone who calls "a new view of the inspiration of the beginning of the century: a beautiful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-deposited costume that makes a massacre at a written table."
People act in an unexpected manner: low-level actions are as much as heroics.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who tried to get sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
"The most rotten expression of this can be seen in the trade of a gonorrhoea goose that soldiers bought and greaseed in their genitals in the hope of getting into a hospital," he writes.
"All the desperate were rubbing him in the eye, which often led to life blindness."
Mr. Enlongd's prosse with Swedish Peter Graves is flexible, but non-brook, well suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war "freered completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start asking why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books of World War I were often indirect, such as the Great War and Modern Memory, Paul Fassel, or novels such as the "Western Front without Change" of Erich-Marie Remarca, rather than exhaustive historical work.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unshablon pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in the indecent literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he came from a book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and burned it with a match.
After previous error - carefully calculated raid
The operation involved hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because in Zukotti Park, at that time, there should have been fewer people.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said they were going to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence emphasized how much the operations of the Police Department had been important.
There could be no repetition of such episodes of recent weeks as the use of trans-gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy to the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to release Zukotti Park protestors.
The authorities were preparing to observe the occupation in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on the island of Randells, with a calculation of Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - in the light of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of East River.
The order to enter the park came at the last minute, told a source familiar with orders that referred only to "training."
"There are a few cops I know and they've been called into this case without saying that they're being sent to Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but they retreated to hundreds of protesters who had gone inside before the scheduled deadline, hearing about those plans.
The operations on Tuesday were attended by officers from various police units, including district forces, police teams, who were usually used to control the crime surrounding the area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like to work, came and left the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night the right time to come.
"It was nice to do that when the park was the lowest of the people," he said.
Rescue vehicles with lighters and loud speakers, gathered in Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
Prospects and pre-recorded announcements, which are not made out of loud speakers, seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply collected their belongings and left.
The police reported that the tents weren't touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack.
Other police teams, according to witnesses, were going round the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that it had been done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police were working and that the police had treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with TV cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through the chest of the protestors' personal belongings, including bags, plastic rugs and plastic bags full of clothes, the Department's health teams followed her, gathering what had been abandoned.
Some protestors who refused to leave were taken out, photos of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the kitchen camp at the park centre.
Some have built barricades, and the police have gone inside and arrested them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicentre put themselves together by hand.
And two people chained themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the locks, rescue officers were summoned.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, and the police reported it.
Mr. Brown said that approximately 142 persons had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for "harming public order and resisting detention," he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department, was the most senior officer in the field.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's search police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present "not in charge of the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police officers was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, in case they had to go inside.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, in the south.
Observers saw the police expand the perimeter even beyond the Zukotti Park border from these positions.
At one point, the observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, push people further away.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped into the roof of a police car, while others, according to witnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The School Service Union will sue the city for dismissal
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students learn.
The trial is probably the last means available to the Union of the District Council 37 attempting to terminate dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a focal point for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of what trade union leaders called a political response to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by groups of workers to close the hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearings last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott of Schools said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board was competing to tell him that there was no indication anywhere in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had filed a notice of claims, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to file a formal complaint with the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
In the claim, Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education will be identified as respondents and eight temporarily dismissed employees are listed as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latin American women, as are most assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint before New York Times, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals at Staten Island and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribezi schools, 17 school support workers lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Okrujah 8 and 9 in Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants who worked at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: "These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget failures."
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it counted additional funding for each poor student who went to school.
The trade union also claims that school principals could have been misled by the language of notification allowing the dismissal of focal points for working with their parents.
The notice used the word "excess" although the word "overstatement" is more often said when a teacher is moved from the school's payroll to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Six-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," says a black suit, "and not simply transferred."
Mission over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to Libya's rebellion.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to go away, the long-standing dictator Muammar Qadhafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee should consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) together with Senators John Macken (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who praises the Libyans for the successful rebellion and the United States troops for the "vaganda."
"The point of this resolution is to pay tribute to the important people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"This is confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations by both parties."
Language may seem harmless, but no other discussion on Libya has taken place easily.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties disputed with each other and with the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing the limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also did not support a proposal that would cut off the funding of the United States operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some sort of legislative purgatory - when Congress is quite annoyed enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to actually get the ground out of her legs.
Then the events overcame the indecision of the Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and on 20 October Qadhafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "is admired by the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary endurance in their quest for freedom," and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Are new measures fully supported by the foreign affairs council or divided by legislators as a June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, Republican leader of the Committee, opposed the latest version.
Luger's representative said he hadn't seen the last version of the bill yet on Monday.
On the other side of the Capitol, this week the House of Representatives should vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of that meeting.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Hudlat Amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been raised in this meeting.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and more about "control over federal expenditures."
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans, who wish to paint their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they have made such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrat, New York), wants to lift the limit of two terms for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as has another prohibition of flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As Congress members sought to propose amendments, they were moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and 66 were introduced in 110.
This pace will follow from the beginning of the 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they've made no more progress than they are now.
The last amendment adopted, 27th, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Giffords in her first television interview after the assassination," says.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona), appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, she sang a tune from the Broadway Show "The Sun will return" and said he wanted to recover more than to return to Congress.
By entering the 20/20 program, Aby-si News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help when walking.
The program showed her a difficult path of recovery following a bullet injury that smashed the skull and smashed the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the draft law on the debt limit.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and called her recovery "hard."
On Sawyer's question, how she feels, the 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, an astronaut by Mark Kelly, was part of the "20/20" special issue, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book of the couple "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
His release told me about Gifford's recovery after the shooting on January 8, 2013.
On the video that Kelly took in the first few weeks, she's on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Kneel your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking me to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by A.B.S. shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see Congressman singing with girls just wanting to have fun, Cindy Loper and Tom Petty's Free Fall.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said he didn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband told me that he read Giffords an article in the newspaper about the shooting on 12 March when she stopped him to ask him the first time about the six who were killed at that time.
The suspected attacker, Jerd Lee Lafner, is being held in Missouri prison and subjected to compulsory treatment pending trial.
"My people are dead," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're only beaten.
And you're gonna go through this, you're gonna get better and come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, disappointment and loss.
On the signal, several hundred soldiers, seafarers, pilots and marines built around him.
The auditions in the tuxing were applause for him standing.
"The soldiers were looking at heroes," said David Zalzman, who organized the spring money collection.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also the then Chairman of the Staff Chiefs Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have developed between the army and often indifferent, sometimes admired by the American public.
Troops are being commended for their sacrifices.
But the praises have their price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like it's feeling sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who led troops in Iraq and soon leaves for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
It's a sensitive topic for military commanders who don't want to look ungrateful or disagreeable with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of Viet Nam's war has been much worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity is quiet and only between the war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from fighting in the Marine Corps, the Colonel in the resignation of Mark Cannes warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they have shaken the rebels and been in exotic places.
Others will think that "the violent veteran is hiding under the mask," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and took up a high government post in Washington when he returned.
While he was looking for a job, he said he felt that some interviewers had been cautiously asking if he could withstand the pressure of the responsible work in Washington right after the fighting.
Cannes recalls how he told his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely rewarded by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as usual in World War II," says Lieutenant General David Barnow, who was commanding American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is concentrated on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
Troops are estimated by the number of trips they have made, by the number of comrades they lost, or by the magnitude of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, historic court hearings should decide whether 28 men and women against the army will be sued for rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the next one.
In her first class, Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, allegedly raped by her co-workers at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego after having dinner with a friend and met a male co-worker carrying 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
"It was a red box," said Lyman.
But Texas's herb has lifted her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct."
A few minutes after they walked into Lyman's room, a man came to her back, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former soldiers will be very busy waiting for the judgment of the trial at a historic hearing to take place in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit that they filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will be brought before the court.
The claim alleges that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case filed in February by counsel, Susan Burke, from Washington, D.C., originally included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all claiming that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their employees, and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or brought justice following alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the army's tops because the problem starts with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?"
Burke also says that some 400 other victims have contacted her since February, many of whom may be involved in future claims.
Her strategy: Instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to say, she'll open up a lot of cases if you need to keep pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal the protection strategy - mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs," as stated in the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: today's wars rarely have a clear front line.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers ' teams play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the combat zone.
Outcome: 150 female soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
It's time for the armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her trial, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, a seminar of the Veteran Law Service is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on the charge of promoting a women ' s atmosphere.
A separate, non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing an action against an army that is at the heart of the "change of identity" diagnosis that is being diagnosed by victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group, the Organization of Action of Women Soldiers.
Her group had filed an action against the Office of Veteran Affairs in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices in dealing with applications for pensions from people who claimed to have been subjected to sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases reached the court, half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she claimed rape in the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to share the details of the rape on 11 separate occasions with the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from a cut on her arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing in which she was asked whether she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six individuals gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," said Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby, I ran out of court with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial against him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a change of personality, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her comrades on trial is a difficult question, says John Terly, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my view, they are able to move forward."
Between them and the verdict, there is a doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've been criticizing Doctrina Ferres all my life.
The army has been delayed for decades because it does not have the incentives and constraints that impose responsibility.
He adds: "Shangs are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue fighting with the army on this matter until reform is done," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens before.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breiwick was a regular guy who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braywick, who confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which claimed 77 lives, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Braywick could act alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, bringing together millions of nationalists who support right groups on social media.
After a summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, just go on Facebook.
"We realized that it was not difficult to reach them," said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on European cyber-populism of the British DEMOS Research Centre.
The personal data supply on Facebook is so great, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the site's promotion tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific precision - that marketologists have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then gave them publicity, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the ad offered the user a survey about their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are less striking: online right-wing groups - most often young men, disgruntled immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the light, from health issues to social trends, as expressed in Laykah, posts on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three entries per day, Facebook's "super-actual information" causes research booms, increasing the number of scientific articles called the site in the headline by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Faisbuck's beauty is that he provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"Ranche, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join the party and they'd never accept you," says Bartlett.
"Facebook excludes all of this - you turn directly to them."
Others say that social health issues could be identified and explored through the site.
Dr. Megan Moreno ' s latest study from Wisconsin University, Madison, and her colleagues, showed that students who discussed their drunken faeces on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students ' peers, such as their hostels, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christkis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Conduct and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We've found a way to identify children at risk that wouldn't otherwise have been discovered."
Facebook also constantly extracts different types of data about its users.
The site's data processing team has processed statistics on the status and day of St. Valentine, voter turnout in mid-term in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that is available only to them - cyberfree champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, likes them or not, in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what happens when Facebook users get involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for offline research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think that many users at least thought about what an researcher can watch their profiles," said Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the public pages of students on Facebook.
"Only they imagined it was just between them and their friends."
The question then arises about methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the object of the study is very honest.
It is not possible to find out on Facebook how many information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of its work in technology research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools to be used.
"Nothing can replace a way into real peace and communication with real people," he says.
"It is suggested that social research is about social research, and most social research is still being done offline."
"The cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Breiwick will first appear publicly before the courts.
Anders Bering Breiwick, a man who confessed to the double attack that took 77 lives in Norway this summer, described himself as a "opposion" fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Tamils of Norway," he spoke in front of the 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit action, but I don't confess guilt."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who brought a written speech with him, to address the victims ' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to hold Brevik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from having access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Bravik in the eyes, others to make sure he was kept under lock.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told Norwegian NRK one of the survivors on Utaya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally it made me feel a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
The wearing of a dark suit and a blue Braywick tie remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange idea of Breiwick that he was part of a large resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with his accomplices.
Some may be relieved that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist rather than radical groups.
But it does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but he's not," said the relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans can count the biggest discovery in a recently discovered interview, which was remembered in the run-up to the pre-emergence in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a bottom-up organizer and a modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business managers had suffered from "the pain of thinking that a really great idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skill."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created a Triumph Nerd TV series about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it's been about 10 years since Jobs got kicked out of Apple, and he's been working his new computer company NeXT, waiting for massive Internet development.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in Nerda, he says that the original interviews were missing during transport.
Only after Jobs died a full VHS dig was found in the director's garage.
This film, slightly edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: The lost interview that comes out in Landmark Theatres on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs seems to be unusable here to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different moments during the interview, there are long intervals between questions and answers - reflections on 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface where he seems to be annoyed by Kringley's questions, forcing him to move quickly to issues or events of greater importance.
In Pixar's era, the iPods and iphons of the Lost Interview, there is a prophetic thing to do when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
It's one thing to read about the postmortem assessments of Jobs' work, but there's something fragile and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the lost interview:
About how he learned how to run business:
"For all the time in business, I keep asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get, "Oh, it's just doing it."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline the reporting in Apple.
A built-in method of recording the costs, often beginning with "standard costs," which came out of the ceiling and then came up with "discussion," he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs up to a small scale.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs details the blue box he made with Steve Vonjac, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a telephone company and call long distances free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' euphoria is here when describing the blue box as an act of giving power is contagious.
He tells us how he and Vonjac tested the box using a telephone machine, making conversation, and then connecting one AT&T network to another, until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've yelled at the machine phone, and it's been in the next-minute phone machine," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young, and all we learned is that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without it, Apple could ever have appeared.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous exit that he and Vonjac practically managed by calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking the Pope for a phone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, these two were laughing just before the Pope was raised to answer the phone.
About in love with technology (and the cold name of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, after hunting for spare parts to collect the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett on the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett Pacard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and she formed my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer."
He was the size of the suitcase, he had a little wire monitor with an e-ray tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to the HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for her.
On improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs' interviews talk about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career when he went to sell a handful of installation fees, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think about both the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember violent disputes... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I went out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Large companies that lose energy:
Long before he took over Apple's revival, Jobs had clearly predicted that many industry leaders would be wrong about the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's let you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and people who make the product are removed from the decision-making field.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is removed by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the skill required.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
He could've been ten times more, could've been Microsoft in the '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea from the great product separates a great amount of skill... when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you need to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts - connecting them all together...
In the end, it all comes to taste - it's all about trying to express itself to the best of what people have ever done, and later to try to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what the famous Macintosh did was that the people who worked for him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become the best information technology professionals in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they would do amazing things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case.
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether it would listen to the challenge of President Obama ' s health law, his two judges, Antonina Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated for lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One case on the agenda was a 26-State motion challenging the rapid review of health adopted by the Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists throughout the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, the 5 1/2 hour turning debate is expected in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle in the presidential race, which will be at the height of the time when the judgement will be read.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law must be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federationist Society, a long-standing group that consistently upholds conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc's pharmaceutical giant, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a known opponent of the Health Act.
Honored guests at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federationist Society for many years.
And it's not against ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were subject to principle 4C of the Code, which states: "The courts may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, a guest of honour or be mentioned in the programme of such an event."
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, like a company with high financial interests, was a sufficient signal to the ethics activists in the Government.
"It is a shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code that contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules as those applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges have been drinking and having dinner at an official fund-raiser with lawyers who are currently being tried in court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all allegations of fearlessness and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with case groups such as the Federationist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Obama administration when the first judicial objections to the law were filed at the court level of first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown she's gonna do that.
Boeing gets a record 18-million-dollar flight order
Emirates' airline is ordering 50 large-scale planes Boeing 777 and possibly ordering another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the transaction size is over $1 billion.
It's hardly the news that the company gets an order of 50 pieces of its product.
But it's an important event when this company is Boeing Co., and the price for all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It's just as important where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold stock of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 fixed-wing aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft this weekend - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total price to $26 billion, declared Boeing to Aviashou Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could boast of much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The price of six fixed-wing aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neal Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have money to pay for the aircraft, but also the increase in fuel prices, which usually harm airlines, as it is one of their largest items of expenditure, is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the aircraft's order when the prices rise, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market of large-scale aircraft and helps prevent Airbus SAS's rival from attempting to undermine its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus announced that he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competed just since 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after the buyers demanded an increase in cargo capacity and flight range.
The Boeing Co stock grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico apparently lost in the Michoakana elections.
Louise Maria Calderón claims that the drug traffickers were helping the opponent Fusteau Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister did not appear to have applied for Governor Michoakan during violent State elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped encourage a race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the position of Governor of the Western State is Fausto Vallejo from the Institutional Revolution Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacana but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderón in radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... and they grabbed the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the EPI.
IRP managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing for her return, and the victory in Michoakana is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win presidential elections in July.
Valeho seems to have only a little overturned by Calderon, who ran the ratings until the election day.
Calderón, a candidate from the National Action Party, or a PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, now owned by the Governor's chair, was the third major defeat for divided and unsuccessful leftrs before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Valeho, former mayor of the capital of Morel, denied links to drug traffickers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
In Michigan, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long dominated.
This is the home state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the election, when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For the IIR, however terrible the elections in Michoakan may look, victory will give the party the momentum.
The man who should represent the EPI in the presidential race, Enrique Pen Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the past of next year."
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone.
The Asian Development Bank pledged to India and China to be willing to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of ADB's office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies should "do what they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block, either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's "dispute" difficulties, and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invincible."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing funds have risen dangerously, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The European debt crisis has created fears that it can lead the world economy back to recession, and has led to calls on the leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, provided a tremendous amount of financial stability in Europe, in negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find a job for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varchner, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very politically difficult to provide assistance to Europe for Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom some 800 million live on or less than $2 million a day.
"At some point, they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to the sea for holidays, and it will not be taken well," he said.
Lee Hovell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to include Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing "punitive risks" due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to draw up "emergency plans" to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Dangerous warnings to the Pentagon of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, set the scene on Monday at the Congress, warning that the anticipated automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the lines and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting better with a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion or more can be unavoidable if Congress cannot reach an agreement on costs.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry," Panetta reported in a letter to the senators of Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the Congress ' s inability to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester initiated a total reduction of 23 per cent and the discontinuation of many new projects.
"This severe reduction, which has been so recklessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize," wrote by Panetta to senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our staff and, as the reduction will take place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the state to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously undermine preparedness."
The reductions will ultimately affect the military, Panetta said.
"Which military funding in the Overseas Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the Spectre, military achievements will be seriously affected by serious disruption in the core budgets," warned Panetta.
"Contraception personnel will be reduced, which will end with the cancellation of contracts and the oversight contract that supports the troops."
"Statute staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military vendors, and legal and political support will be disrupted."
Two senators wrote Panetta 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of the sequester in the Ministry of Defence will be a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against these dragon actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we're supposed to impose ourselves."
"Sexwester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter or senator's latest warnings of fiscal compromise or calls for the release of the Pentagon from cuts will be added, we will see later.
The Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of budgetary analysis in Congress and the White House, and was aware that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a bleak picture of what might follow -- troops with a bolt, but without a core.
"It's a ship without seafarers."
"It's a no bullets squad."
"It's a wing of a plane without sufficiently trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers able to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his introductory remarks in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from a fragile spirit of combat, a bad willingness and unable to fight against potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, new details were provided on how the reductions "created significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond worldwide; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects might face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Marines need to replace the Hammer.
Ending further development and testing of F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it's a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other opponents.
How to catch lies
A blind look at the last headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is engaged in challenging allegations of sexual harassment against several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
The Administration of Pennsylvania University was charged with false testimony because they allegedly concealed that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught when, when a microphone was included, Baraku Obama, President of the United States, said that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy their careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet exbending player Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself denying their exits, which quickly denied the irrefutable evidence.
A former presidential candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extramarital ties.
Again, none of the survivors at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who is lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinsky during his second term in office.
The history of fraud at school and college exams is a common matter.
There were instances where teachers gave students answers to the tests in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
The mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
For one day, research shows that you can lie 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie for salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Identification of lies or evidence of lies is a necessary skill for everyone, both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game like, say, charades where you need to say, "Get up!" the discovery of lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities dealing with comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of lies were divorced.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always fall behind, they stutter, they're red or they're fuzzy.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can reach the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the micus, the structure of the issues and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recrucing, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
The good liars are perfectly capable of reading others, making them feel uncomfortable by controlling their own emotions and intuitive feelings as others perceive them.
We know from the study that the extraverts lie more often than the introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women are usually about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but the lies they say are most often glittery).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, watch the normal behavior of your object.
It's called a "state of reference."
This helps to provide a starting point for the assessment of changes further.
Watch the pose, laugh, voice characteristics of your object.
If you'd like to know if a man's feet are always normal, then you won't be able to make unfair accusations when you see the foot knocking in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for groups of misleading notes and non-verbal actions.
You treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
The cheaters can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, lean towards the door, change their position in a certain way, or show "enhanced after the interview" -- this exaggeration of relief and change of position when all complex questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the termination of the interrogation to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at your object's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have turned around and used the past, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
I have no sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky, or a difficult question to repeat.
The most typical note-based indicators are hardly catchable.
Someone can use a "qualification language" when he answers a difficult question: "Okay... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and often the red flag.
There's no magical means to detect lies, but you can learn to detect deception.
These skills will increase everyone's chances not to be the victim of skilled jouls in professional and personal life.
The oil pipeline dispute plan needs to be reviewed after the US threat to postpone its approval
A few days after Obama ' s administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, raising the anger of trade unions, but resting the environmentalists, a company that was planning to build a pipeline claims that it would be willing to revise the project to resume work on it.
Transcanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from an environmentally sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still be approved.
The company called this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska State Capitol.
The official representative of Transcanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, although with another route.
This happens after the announcement by the State Department last week that he will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until he studies new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Peschen Hills of Nebraska and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay the decision until 2013, following the next year ' s elections, although the authorities denied that policy had been involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, cited the decision to appeal to the State Department and expressed support for it.
An oil pipeline of 1,700 miles shall extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's got to move 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to a refinery in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental advocates, but he loves trade unions, who hope for some 20,000 jobs associated with the pipeline.
But Nebraska's lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Pesc Hills and Ogalala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current State Department ' s environmental impact study had shown that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry had stated that the Department ' s auditor had commissioned a separate review exercise focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was an adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another is whether the firm that was hired to conduct an initial study was not suitable because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly causing a child to get sick of fear.
A New York family claims that Patty LaBell's disco-dream began to run into the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to such a extent that he was sick of fear.
Lady Marmalade's tyrande scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so badly that she changed her personality, sleep disorder and "strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on 10 November last year when Kevin Monk's work scenes, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the building lobby on Riverside's boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle was angry with a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came into rage and began to use a grudge -- a word on C and a word on F -- on elevated tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysterical start.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her accompanying man had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so hard she puked, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but did not receive an answer.
LaBell's lawyer and representatives aren't answering their comments.
The amount of compensation for the harm is not reported, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to contribute any money that would be paid to children with cancer.
"The goal is to get Patty LaBell to take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to the kindergarten teacher with a 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign of Mario López, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased in Sinaloa, foreign financing declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 - The year that will enter Sinaloa ' s economic history as linked to the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes, also known as the year of change, which has generated great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only caused millions of losses to the agricultural sector, but limited the growth of the public economy by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, largely due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on the areas affected by the freeze provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in whole and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and nut being the main damaged crops.
The decline in economic activity had led to a steady rise in unemployment in the state until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, to an accelerated increase in unemployment, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53% of the economically active population, in the second quarter, the share increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a proportion which represented more than 74,000 unemployed residents in Sinaloa, an increase of 18,969 over the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is dominated by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (USA), the increase in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to the actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market to limit the resources imposed by the law enacted in Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is not easy for people who illegally own the dollars to work with, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
López Servantes said there was also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad in the United States was limited, primarily because of difficulties in entering, and in the second, since once they entered, they already faced very many difficulties in finding employment, so that a group of people remained and required jobs here in the state, as a result of the rising unemployment rate," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Analysis of Sinaloa's labour market is worse when attention is drawn to the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and formalization, another reminder of employment in the State is represented by low wages; the State has the lowest wages in the country, according to the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was up to September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest foreign direct investment outflows in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, amounted to $630,697 between January and July, showing a decline of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,543,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development recorded a total of 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, mostly for service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested a 3 billion pesos loan at the State Congress in July, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and until November, the debt benefits were not expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdes shows a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that there had been a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the State Government itself, during 2011.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, has to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have been unable to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
López Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state's economy and its efficiency and growth had been limited this year.
"The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including the freeze, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, consequently, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the State needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme should be developed that will re-establish the direction and economic course of the state, and we need to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa possesses," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction in order to better guide the Government ' s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various fields, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current Administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy manner.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is starting to engage in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He is sentenced for eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years ' imprisonment and a fine of 100 days ' income, such a sentence was handed down to a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, had been sentenced to possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during patrols on the street of Cyprusiano Valdes, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck in which he carried a black bag in a car drawer, and a passenger seat was a small backpack where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized was placed at the disposal of the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Crime Legal Consequences Support Centre.
We have to make contributions to work.
Public works related to programmes such as Rodina, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of being incomplete or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, as Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger, as the State Government was unable to make the necessary contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be contributed by the State, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so that it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they haven't given us any spears when they were supposed to give us a part," he said, "to keep up, we started work, and they've made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not made the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the term of office the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, a sum that had not been provided by the State administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration, because the state did not have financial opportunities to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to those programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains to be the state," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that interest related to them would come as soon as possible.
"They're supposed to make almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they didn't give us any copies."
The Court will approve a digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected constitutional claims filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transfers the so-called "distribution to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not obtained to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers by issuing a decree detailing the steps taken to move to digital ground television.
As a result, constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of the eight votes necessary for the court to make a declaration on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree should be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned therein regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the project ' s arguments in that the federal executive could not determine the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the public administration.
"I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body" and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector was relevant to the federal executive, with a constitutional mandate, government administration.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals - one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of digitizing the benefits, which included meeting the public needs, which had not only a technical dimension, "because it covered economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he said, "it is necessary for the entire system established by the principle of public economic governance to be composed of a group of authorities that unites the Constitution into the State executive branch."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting and had done so through the executive, despite the existence of very specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of Congress, ensures the administrative implementation of the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacana, the possibility of counting "votes for voice" is analysed.
According to data transmitted to the PDP, the difference between the first and second seats in the Governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total number of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "votes" is real, with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoakana, where according to the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (EPR), the difference between the first and second seats in the Governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total number of 6,074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Elections, Michoacana (IVM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragosa, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in the electoral process and Governor Leonel Goda Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame specified in the Act in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJJJ) decided on a constitutional claim made by the local legislature and called "unful and illegal" the voice of the State representative for constitutional reform, since he was not entitled to "accept or support them."
In an interview on the possibility of a vote, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that, with the adoption of appropriate principles, the General Council of the IMM would be able to present a partial or complete counting of votes by the local electoral authority.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made under conditions that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the box or he is not in the Chair ' s possession; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, a general count of votes in all the ballot rooms may occur when there is a indication that the difference between the proposed electoral winner and those who obtained the second ballot is less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a petition from the party representative and/or coalition that issued the second candidate.
A general count of votes will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate taking the second place is less or equal to one percentage, provided that there is a petition from the political party whose candidate took the second place, in the event of the exclusion of the ballot boxes that were taken into account in part of the recalculation.
It is worth noting that this situation is characterized by elections in Morelia, where according to the PDP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, even excluding 129 votes in the total of 923 protocols.
His final will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalnam, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening, and an inspection and a calm mess were carried out on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the colonel was that his ashes were scattered in the mountains of Sapalnam.
Following the adoption of condolences with other people who died in a disaster, the Basio Cortesa family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of Mexican Air Force, and the closest people visited the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant's ashes arrived at a chapel located on the boulevard of Nazario Ortiz Garcia, where the family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he was examined by the Santillo Technology Institute by his former high school classmates and a football team, which was a member of Felipe Basio during high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes should be scattered in the mountains of Sapalnam, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister, reported.
In her view, the colonel fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to join the Air College in Sapopan, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he had a headache even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him as he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
Young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopán to attend his relative's diploma ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving the plane.
He's on the last track.
Guns fired after Lieutenant Colonel Félipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, villagers and state government, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technical Secondary School in Saltillo, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress both in his studies and in sports, took him on the final path.
Basio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he managed suffered a crash, along with the provincial government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, Basio Cortes' remains (replaced), Saltillo's resident, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martínez, to an esplanade of the training school, where his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers, had already been waiting for him.
Three bodies found abandoned on the NL Cadereit farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed 11 people in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in various parts of the body with a gunshot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereit Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was found at a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the Kadereit road towards Santiago, on the hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gate was open in a village house whose wall was painted in a beige and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three metres, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the authorities concerned.
One man was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man next to him in a white shirt.
Nearly one metre was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there was no casing on the spot.
There are signs at the fence of the village house directed by one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullets in it and at the gate.
11 captured in Kadereit
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, mainly in the municipality of Kadereit, accused of kidnapping, murder, fraud and secret graves.
According to published information, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided by three houses and telephones, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
Another event took place on 12 November at 0600 a.m., military personnel raided the village of Old Rancho in Kadereit when they saw a car without plates with two men at the salon.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, following these statements, on 13 November at 1400, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, when he saw the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hina and Caderate.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister appointed, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic catastrophe.
The Italian Prime Minister appointed, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of economic catastrophe and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He was expected to present a Cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it was not clear when the new executive branch would take up its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told the reporters.
Monty didn't say clearly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is well defined," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy has been struggling with a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monty to rush, unstable markets have set revenue from Italy's BTP bonds for 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marcellia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting with Monty: "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is Italy ' s last chance to emerge from this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said the reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Centralist Right Party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of the technocrats that Monty is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular reforms of austerity.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure by warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty started consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women ' s organizations, on Monday.
He's gonna finish his schedule Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy's debt was now at a critical level, given the uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread projections that politicians would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said that he wanted to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be drawn from technical experts only, demonstrating their dissatisfaction with the impact of the financial situation on the process.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and opposition by parties made it difficult to attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more game experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 listed players played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica by comparing 22 players caused by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the champions of the world and Europe, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a whole list of class A selection games, Tricolor has only counsel for Michael Uman as the only one who played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at a stadium called Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers playing all the stars in the League and the strong clubs of the British Prime League were very active in the league and local cube competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish van in the complex skills of the Euro or the World Cup should be added.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that we're leading the list at the Spanish collection of Icker Casillas, who, last Sunday against England (the game that lost 0-1 in London), repeated the record of the ex-gloquiper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Havi Hernandez, a player in Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Havi were recognized as the best last week by UEFA, together with another player from the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and a bombardir from Shalke Raul González with 102.
Nearly there's a hundred Carles Poyles with 97 games.
Hawi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both from 81, Andrés Injest from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61 and David Silva from 53.
On the part of Costa Rica, near Michael Umana, the left side of Hunior Díaz, with 48 matches and a Brian Ruiz bombarder, with 45.
Then only five of them crossed the line into 30 games: Kaylor Navas from 31, Randall Asofef from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36 and José Luis López from 35.
The rest.
Over 30 matches in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raoul Albiala (31).
In a team with less than 30 exits on the field, there's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Muri with 23.
The rest didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolívar has only one, Alman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading player, David Villa, followed by Fernando Torres, with 50 goals.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points twice as many as Carlos Hernández and three times more than Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintette included the country on a 20-year career tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it's also a dream that has become a reality - to play in that country.
It was a statement by Basist and Founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The Group is located in South America as part of the 20th anniversary tour and on Sunday, 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will appear at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group of Las Roberts.
It's a passage from a conversation that's completely decrypted online at The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, is this the dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I was only in Costa Rica once on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking about it because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry we took so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We had a few great shows in San Paulo, and we hope that this led us to form this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, with regard to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarino, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and to Mexico, they're great places for surfing, that's how we learned about it, from people who like surfing.
Looking at the tour, you've made a big show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan on doing in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think part of it is because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour, you mark 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First, I think none of us could ever imagine that we'd be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck and are very encouraged that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we like to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we've always wanted to go.
It's really good for us.
What does it mean for you to be a large part of the grange's bloom?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups appear at one time in one city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them, and we're honored to be part of Seattle's sound.
It's also weird that a group like yours has stayed together for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Kameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude to the word was difficult; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We care not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, what none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn't release any album until Andy died.
There was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think about the incredible man Andy was, and how he made me laugh was always happy to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football, and a lot of others.
It was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local group Las Roberts will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open up?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that we liked the most, so we can't wait to see that Las Roberts can offer the live one, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's a question for Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes into his head.
Who affected you as a basist?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Gheather Butler, John Entvisle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There's so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the granja's relevance, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling a little out of line.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's a music that should be listened to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are some songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
From both when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, those songs are very dark.
I think that when you're growing up, and in your life you've had some trauma, and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So I think you can be a happy man and still be able to make dark music.

Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday to a public hospital, and his family doctor informed his family doctor about the loss of muscle force in his legs.
Fujimori, aged 72, sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has been operated four times and monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that, in his view, Fujimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He moved four operations into language cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, added other diseases, such as a strong erosion graft, pancreas cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and leg hemorrhaging problems, and listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Department for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for the murder of 25 persons by forces of the army destruction unit, which had been secret in the first years of his administration.
Muhika goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by President José Muhika of Uruguay, consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will visit Mexico on this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
The Muhika will meet on the following Wednesday with his Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be "good for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations" as published by the South American leadership on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax harbours at the G20 meeting in the French city of Canna.
In his speech Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax hawans, a statement that prompted Uruguay ' s protest and withdrawal to consult his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 group from the most developed and developing countries since November and has, in fact, had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has been trying in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements in order to leave this Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development grey list, drawn from countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had in force since 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which had increased trade between the two countries.
Suction plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil foot of Bower, but he never did it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land," he would fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows three dimensions to be played without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell me how the stereoscopy will work without points," said the head of the Nintendo press service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the Madrid game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game specifically designed under this platform," because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Okarina of Time 3D" were adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that allowed us to enjoy a quick and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part of the simple to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "on the second circle" to the levels of the game, which are now more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome a variety of obstacles and "don't give rise to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the hero to the portable consol, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo wins the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with moustache needs to pass through dangerous, mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "playing" game.
Colum guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colombo said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun to respond in the United States for a 70 million dollars-dollar conspiracy.
This concludes the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that required Portillo to be extradited to try him there.
At a press conference, Colombo said that his decision related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not "drawn hands" to legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colombo has done shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (COP), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent during the loss of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential period, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Affairs filed an appeal and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The outcome of the first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Support Organization is important: 6,000 young people who are socially excluded have helped to overcome the difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
This is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for a ceremony in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared near Trinitat Velya in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of employment and drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's Sant Andreeu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The different political representation during the elections showed a common pattern of work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the General, Arthur Masa, and his predecessor, Hordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-Advisor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and an ex-Leutenant of the Mayor and current Ecosocialist, a member of the Municipal Council of Ricardo Goma.
He also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare and family adviser, Josép Lewis Cleris and CEO of the social work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the settlement of hope in people with difficulties.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and work done to her," he said.
Hosted building where mass parties were organized, evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without fighting.
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living at 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building, which they illegally occupied, and where they organized mass parties, which were annoying to neighbours, on the basis of a court decision without police interference.
When the operation was over, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there's gonna be a checkpoint," the manager said.
The Squattters that captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the building, occupied all electricity and parts of the water, painted walls and left traces of various kinds, especially liquor banks.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted up to two days and was annoying to the owners.
There's a nightclub right behind the building, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, informed Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income had declined by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, while at the club for 10.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about noise, although she observed that the noise was caused not by the club's visitors, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that had organized, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The club owner said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he's been "forgiven" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Counsellor Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week "to evacuate the building immediately in order to solve the problems of coexistence and the common spirit of neighbours and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them had been hacked.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the indignity of the building."
So yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., the police left Montral Street 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition following the payment claims
The 16-door municipal contest resumed the debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now-decreated Barcelona Capital Corporation, the administration printed promo-lists for Kolserola.
Bucklet described the mountain as a big park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SRB, in 1987, the park again ranked in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, not north-south, but up (horse) down (sea).
The construction of Kolserola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype wasn't the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabin as a Yogi bear.
That was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 contests for many other gates to Kolserola.
The gate means the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
Is it one question, Kolserola?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurrent subject discussed when two members of this clan of elected people recognize each other in the elevator.
And this is one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes necessary to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the offer of Idephon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"Let's just say that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent availability.
Kolserola is more complex, says the architect, for whom the title "Colserola's turn" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as entering the park, but as limiting certain areas where we must act."
Like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, he described the proposal as "an intellectual task" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from "uncertain public space forecasting" after the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum's "your swan song" site.
The first fear is the very limitation of boundaries where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," I mean, the transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [for the Capital Master Plan (GSP) ] can lead to real distress."
Closer to the case, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Collserol Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic issue.
Momo recalls that there is already work done outside Calcerola, which "shouldn't pass through the ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor's profession offers to enter the project "from the beginning."
Moreover, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should be led by multidisciplinary teams (the "success" he claims) that should have created: "Architators should be only an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the title of this part is complex, since the rules of the competition lack the general type of Kolserola: "The 16 cross-over competitions have been announced, " he says, "in the sense of the sea-horse, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes it possible, at least in his case, to decide on 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate may cross the program and definition with the architect project for the neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the council has to guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide an area in its entirety equipped for a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative, Red Casino, forgave the brother of Mayor Monterrey in the proceedings against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative Red Casino has granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting a process of extortion against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bomb, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly required him to pay his economic contribution so that the authorities of Monterrey would allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the Attorney General opened criminal proceedings against the mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Crime, he was transferred to a temporary prison located in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained in this place for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order prohibiting displacement, after the prosecutor had ruled out bribery offences and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kadereit allegedly for extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay in the municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Regional Criminal Court, Jorge Janez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence of Jonas' guilt, such as the charging of 1.5 million pesos with bookmakers in exchange for authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether he had compensated for the damage and who of the partners in the gambling house granted pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give a name.
Based on a record of 197/2011, legal pardons were granted to Jonas Larrazabal, and no claims could then be made regarding the process planned against him; nor would any reparation or punishment be required.
After a hearing by the legal representative of the bookmakers, at about 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicholas in Garza to inform Yonaha that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionycio Pérez Hakome describes the details of the disaster in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (IST) reported that the results of the accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others, had died had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity without attempting to land accidentally.
During a press conference, Dionycio Pérez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft had risen up, the pilot had found that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements, which seem to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings contacted trees 25 metres away, where the vehicle lost the fluselage."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that studies carried out in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The vehicle was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant requirements for the carriage of passengers.
The ground in this place has a gradient of seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, the main thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter had been run at cruise speed and that it had occurred on soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of normal flying manoeuvres at the time of the impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Pérez Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable take-off conditions when the aircraft went to the border area between Mexico City and Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a smaller area of height and visibility in the Kuernawak Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the latest recording of the radar of the aircraft are likely not to be a loss of control or a change of direction prior to the impact.
Disbursement of debris in a small area:
The information available to date indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter encountered land under conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the disaster zone, undetected evidence remains in the wreckage of the vessel, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that there may have been multiple contacts with land.
During the field work, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a gradient of 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it crashed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter might have had several clashes with the ground.
After a thorough study of more territory than the defined area near the site where the disaster occurred, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces a programme to search for a gene of obesity
Social protection is headed by a study on finding a gene of obesity for children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect the gene of obesity among children and young people, which was called the "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence" protocol, which would provide an estimate of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Centre for the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, dietists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduates from the National Institute of Healthy Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTATAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (written or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study in Mexico City Valley, where tests involving children will be conducted every Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be held at the Kuautemoke sports centre in the west of Mexico State, and that since 8 October the events had taken place at the sports centre in Nsaualkootle (East Mexico).
Once the goal of involving 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (Men Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the dimensions and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated and the main objective will be to collect three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with parental permission and supervision to fill in individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family heritage diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that anthropometric measurements would be carried out on Saturday for all participants (weight, growth and Taliban), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that in only six years there has been an increase: 77 per cent of boys suffered obesity, 47 per cent of girls; and in the case of excess weight, there has also been a significant increase." The MSSI specialist said.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans were 65 per cent descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent descendants of Europeans and 5 per cent descendants of Africans, a condition that affected genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly the result of obesity genetics is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit for participants, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even he said that the presence of dark warehouses on the neck (s) and forearms meant that metabolism and even prediabet were likely to break.
The information is kept confidential, and the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in the way of life that must be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, most of the day at home before television, and small distance transport rather than walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased use of sweet beverages and carbohydrates (Tamal, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic prepositions analysed in this programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracking
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the chemical faculty of UNAM, developed polymer-modified bitum to produce a mixture of best quality resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If the signals sent by the road were to be addressed, it would be necessary to repair some 200,000 yams for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, said Rafael Herrera Naher, a researcher of the chemical department of UNAM, and added that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt road surface was correct, the number of pits could be reduced or reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the technical view of the pits of the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing polymer-modified bitum for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to the batum, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified battle could be used in places where weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus to counteract the education of the pits.
He explained that the batum, the hardest part of oil, was the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of the high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others were the low molecular mass known as maths, which together gave road cover to its characteristic viscosity behaviour.
The virulent behavior of the Bituum is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves as liquid, at 120, its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains almost solid condition, while at very low temperatures the bitum becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not permanent but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, has been said by the chemical engineering specialist.
The scientist's chemphaca observed that Mexico City's streets were largely covered with flexible coatings, which were made up of six layers of material, of which the last three included batum.
Among the top layers is a batum made of small stones in the batum and then crushed.
Every stone that makes this cover, he says, is loaded in a batum.
When vehicles move and efforts are made, this helps the forces to distribute very well on road cover.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of deterioration made of a small stone, is actually also loaded into asphalt.
As this layer, which will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than asphalt and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface to receive and disseminate these efforts, the deterioration layer also requires adequate thickness, and the material from which it is produced must be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature fluctuations, is also very important for consideration, especially water, he said because it has a significant impact on asphalt condition.
When the earth is wet, the water enters the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it makes it easier for all layers of the surface and hence for the formation of the pits.
When I was born, he said that the first layer was worn out, and only then it affected the bitum, but the damage did not happen instantly, a process that should be taken into account in the first signs of ongoing maintenance programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of a hole, and therefore the thickness of each surface layer must always be linked to the transport load and must guarantee compliance with this requirement in order to prevent the frequent appearance of the pits.
Rafael Herrera said that there was still much to study and do about the battle, for example, the bithum emulsions that in other countries were already on the market and even helped to fix the pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What did you miss the Vale candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons why Serena Melina Ramirez was prevented from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Vale was granted the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Vale del Cauca only wants to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be satisfied with being on the podium of the winners with a silver crown and a tape that proclaimed her new princess Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Ms. Atlantic won the crown and sceptra, the department has 14 titles, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown, but were declared princess, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borreero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorenza Alvarez (1981), Rose Marysate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Laila Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Heise Alhure Garse (2000), Catalina Hiralino (2007), Stephanie Garce Alhure (2008).
The question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favourite, which in each of the statements demonstrated that she had everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just that she was chosen by the Queen Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version, the titles that the Queen had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor to play a role in the jury's decision to award her First Princess title was that she was unable to respond convincingly to the question "What book characterizes you and why?" commissioned by Martin Murilla Gomez of the literary society, let us read it.
She answered to the questionant:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood is a little prince, a pretty deep book.
Today I read Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; also at this moment, I read the book of Irina Nemerovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Creed of Blood."
The answer that the jury didn't like because of the term "culture" and, secondly, because it did not explain exactly how each of the quoted books characterizes it.
But after Melin's ceremony, she said that she was calm and happy with her result: "The whole wise one is doing what's gonna happen."
And you all, please read a little bit, Little Prince is a great book.
Among the hypotheses, Vale was burned from favouritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, since she had been preferred, she had met with ovaries, and she had been a candidate who had received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, the view vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which provoked the jealousy of other candidates, provoked stress at the Queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage."
And that was noted during her first appearance on the Hilton beach bathing suit and her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was clear that she lacked the power and energy she had demonstrated to the representative of Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN's home program, said that the fact that Milena was named princess "is that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become queen."
In addition, Vale's representative has recently avoided communicating with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Vale's representative failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why, two days before choosing a member of Lucy Doti's international jury, they said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty isn't enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only at the appearance, but also to focus on public consciousness before they compete, they should be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that Vale's representative was consoling on the berries and fibrosis seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, since the jury emphasized her as a candidate with "natural beauty," taking into account her more healthy body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
A consultant to Queen Jorge Hernan Orosco notes that Melina had a better body, "but problems of fibrosis on the stomach, which were not very visible to me, forced her to lose her glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but a woman named Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was first given by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the brutal prediction came true last night, saying that it was the uncle that Raimundo gave Melina compensation for having lost her pleasure in getting the crown.
That or not, the fact that Melina is starting a year of government today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at an international competition directly designated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Kano's body.
A forensic scientist from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Kano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, CTI CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Kano in comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics, Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehada, who spent 21 years in the area of judicial investigation this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to pass over five days through the jungle to reach the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale and became a forensic specialist in the area of skin friction, i.e. palms and chairs.
In the week of Elizar's identification operation known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great is coming.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Cauca to Palmir.
He knew he'd have to identify two bodies, one of which was supposed to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Guillermo Leon Saens' prints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not identify him on the outside; he was very different from the one shown in the media.
He wasn't wearing a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much worse.
But prints don't lie.
Using the increased glass, the ink, the shovel and the flashlight, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the photos.
His eyes didn't fail: it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the FARC.
Search for fingerprints
For a dentist in the Sijin unit of Kali, the confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Eliza González at a press conference on the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, dactyloscopy specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and identify detainees.
In detention, many criminals have forged certificates or have no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to take away a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place, the thief relied on his hands to own a safe full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not convenient surfaces for fingerprints, but in this case we can take a picture of all the palms and identify the perpetrator who's been involved in several thefts," he says.
Prints also help to exclude or determine the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with liquor bottles around him was recently found.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative could be suspected of committing a crime and, in fact, fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee he was a murderer, it proves he was at the scene of the murder.
A Dactiloscopy specialist from CTI explained that chemical or physical reagents were being applied to locations where prints were available.
When they show up, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
The fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered on the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves prints on you.
However, if possible, comparisons are made.
"Aggravated People" challenge the authorities of New York
Hundreds of protesters broke the camp in front of Zuccotti.
Some protesters heard the court ' s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
Members of the Wall Street capture movement challenged the authorities of New York on Tuesday when they tried to enter again, under the protection of a court order, into Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another park of the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters buried at Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get caught by a court order that allowed "disturbed people" to set up a camp in the area while the other part of the movement responded to the robbery by seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were carried out.
"Our idea is that, since the trial does not allow us to break the camp in the square, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street capture movement, Mark Bray.
Brei explained that the response to the evacuation of the tent town ordered personally by the Mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg came to a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, "disturbed people" began to seize a new park, located at the site of the merger of central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could have taken the place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't give the exact number, but said Efe had seen several journalists who were in handcuffs too.
The organization assures us that several hundred people were standing with tents where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement in an attempt to mediate negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the area of Zukotti, which is private possession, remains closed pending a trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will review the legality of this morning ' s campaign of protestors.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed copies of the judgement, and even provided copies to the police guarding the area, which led to "some small clashes," said Brei, who said that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and forcing "the laws that were issued after the seizure began, or prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with shops and other property used previously."
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that, as a result of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from re-launching tent shops and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation during which about 200 arrests had been carried out, and a decision had been taken because protesters " had violated the law."
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the area to be cleared because it became "a place where people came not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others," as "some businesses have received threats" and neighbours feared "for deteriorating quality of life."
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, added a representative of the movement that condemns the mayor for "respect for freedom of speech."
Those responsible for the Wall Street capture also indicated that they intended to organize "grandious acts" on Thursday, in collaboration with social organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show.
Along with Michael Bouble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Merry Russell Peters" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at the Big Repair, a lifeguard at Malibu's Saviors, Bunny at Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the Cruner (s) Michael Bubble and other outstanding Canadians, would appear on the Christmas of Russell Peters television program of December 1, as a very special Mary.
The CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely distributed home pornographic video on the Internet, where she appeared with her then husband, a drummer of the Mötley Crüe group, Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll that depicts Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comedian who recently played as the leader of the "My cruel torpedo of Truth," Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a special CTV Christmas show is attended by a Canadian singer, Bouble, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March on the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato, who also knows how to deal with scandals.
Recently, Bubble called "suck" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, reborn after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall cycle that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to the nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe brought about by the Sunrise Stran since World War II.
According to the Tokyo Government ' s first estimate, material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the world ' s difficult situation, seems to be taking place.
After three consecutive waste quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent over the previous quarter and by 6 per cent annually.
Registered in the second quarter - for Japanese financial year starting in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly attributed to the resumption of the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a drop of 0.9 per cent in capital costs from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true fracture in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using crabs to grow from scratch.
Japan has grown, mainly because of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of increased costs of automobiles, travel and recreation.
Claymo yen
Tokyo provided the domestic market, when the yen, a Japanese currency, became one of the "currency-conversions" taken by investors who want to escape the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that puts the stone on the export companies' accounts.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to the country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blames the yen in their low numbers from July to September.
As long as markets continue to siege EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshiiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a downturn in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the world economy ' s fractures showed that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, compared with 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives the ground for doubt.
Papadimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With the offshore risk and uncertainty prizes in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze that leads to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that Ellada's new transitional government's agreement is imposed more by Brussels than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative party, "New Democracy," Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The Government ' s main task was to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that would result in tomorrow ' s confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we do not promise anything."
Conservative leaders took one step more in their moods about the EU and IMF, organizations that should freeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that it would not give its approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, while still feeling annoyed by the effects of the allegations of the Papandreou referendum in style or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands were unambiguous: it would not resume assistance unless the new Government and leaders of the major Greek parties signed a "written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that three inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date had not yet been indicated.
There's enough strings in the Greek club for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope."
The Queen stressed Spain's "core" position with respect to this type of finance
Spain "taken a prominent place in the world in the area of microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that, over the past two decades, the country had become the second largest donor in terms of the instruments of cooperation whose "activity" she said was that it was "a tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humankind based on faith in people."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolad with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such action is "rely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially with a view to halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded."
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes up this task with "responsibleness," says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "encourage the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, "the principal recipients of these loans."
There are "many achievements" and "many of the difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a forum for disputes, but also a platform that promotes "two main objectives."
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that, by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and 100 million of those households would be excluded from the poverty they had been burdened with.
The impulse to create a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world was "on the road started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Ms. Sofia as a "law of justice and recognition."
And she described the father of the instrument as "the fundamental idealist in the universal fight against poverty," whose work had been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy on the ground.
One year later, this experience was replicated by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I've seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project had given her yesterday the title of "family heads" gathered in Valadolida "the bank of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by encouraging participants to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity was a "ethical imperative" for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it was a "permanent undertaking."
Jimenez concluded that microcredit implies a "serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty" and now "more than ever" Governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be the victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the "success" of giving "trust" to the people "to whom all doors are closed" and the mayor of Valadolide Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city "opening their doors in solidarity."
HDS proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDF) was held in Leipzig on Monday 14 November without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned in the programme, but it came in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as fast as it should be today vis-à-vis Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy...
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was presented for discussion by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing fences, which lasted a few minutes, which earned their statements by Angel Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Shoyble, Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is "not less than Europe but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
It's time for the Chancellor to make a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean a change in the Lisbon Treaty that makes it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the financial policy of the eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote "to give Europe a face."
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which is obviously the Volfgang Scheuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain opposes it, and HDZ leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy too is against it.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each EU member country in the administration of the European Central Bank according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In wishing to calm down the situation in his party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cole, but she did not seek to influence Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticize "higher" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes a whole paragraph to the importance of German-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing away.
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig became a scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon Army.
What's a hospital leaf fraud?
Following cash benefits, UMP and the Government began to attack hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Allocation Fund and to make a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And in order to help this move, which has come out of the desire to save itself in a difficult situation, but also as part of the presidential re-election campaign, most want to focus on hospital leaves.
In the first place, in view of budget savings, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies prior to the payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the employer ' s special consent, the worker will lose a salary in four days equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without payment of sickness benefits (the public employees still did not have to wait for payment of the benefit, as opposed to three days waiting for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most are also raising the issue of fraud again, with a view to the abuse of hospital leaflets.
Control will be tougher and better if you get caught, you'll have to return all the illegal payments you've received," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital leaves.
Indeed, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002, which have borne fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a look at the country's numbers first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs of Euro11.3 million in 2008 were 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
Thus, 2.5 per cent of the health-related costs were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The arithmetic average, which conceals some irregularities; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said they had not taken any day of hospital.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of hospital beds lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days prior to one month, 15 per cent of one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
By comparing these figures with those of European neighbours, French workers are not more likely to take hospital care than any other country ' s employees.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital leaves fraud is very low compared to grey employment.
As far as the level of fraud is concerned, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in a systematic review of the hospital ' s length of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term sick reports were "unjusted" or too long" - 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "unappropriate or unfounded," equivalent to 132,000.
In general, 169,000 cases were "unjustified" on several million workers who received sick leaves.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the number of "ser" jobs.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they account for between 9 million and 15,000 million euros of uncollected budget income per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos in Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out this task.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment," said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "core objective" of the new Government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone was "to be at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos projected a reduction in the country's budget deficit of about 9 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Right Rejects the Measures of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the right leader, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further austerity measures.
"We're not voting for new measures," he said in a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy Party.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that hindered economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not release the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Eutanasia and suicide need to be legalized with outside assistance, the committee of experts states
Canadians are denied death, confirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and this is not the case of cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code to allow suicide with foreign help and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is 10 places, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death."
Because of the medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6 per cent of them end up dying at the hospital.
The country ' s highest rate is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with external assistance, the report concludes that it is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with external assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse of use, i.e. the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference, most of the cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside help were not legalized.
Eutanasia is practised in Canada, where it is manifestly illegal.
Foreign suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians are pro-Eutanasia because, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, they believe that this will make it possible for people at the end of life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to people who had assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation was less clear, and the authors said.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that the legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the abandonment of end-of-life health care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal sedition already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to cause physical pain as euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some health-related legislation experts have already commented on the findings of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschán, a health law specialist, described as "blackness" the position of experts who signed the report, since, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says the metre of Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Descham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all the other values that formed the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
An expert in health law, Margaret Somerville, also expresses "a strong disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called "manifest for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside help are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to take over power
Damascus condemns the "reservation"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The supporters of Bashar Assad conducted a demonstration yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Siria Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the "reservation" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan resigned President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call upon President Bashar Assad to take over power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed.
"If the interests of his country were to be dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, " said the King of Jordan, next to Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkey ' s Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, expressed regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and could not satisfy their aspirations would lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey was increasingly taking a hard course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "enlargement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly hard course with regard to the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces died in the Der ' a area in southern Syria, reporting to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died during the shooting and firing of heavy machine guns at Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He also responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was "a dangerous step."
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that this plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying "the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the rotation of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppe, also advocated the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into "paranoia."
The League ' s new emergency meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the fighting towns and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday that the decision of the League of Arab States was "uncorrected," while China called on Syria to implement the plan to emerge from the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked markets for a little time to form their team and implement a programme that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's reign.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today ' s meeting with trade unions and employers.
He would have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a multi-victim programme, told Francesco Nukar, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions after meeting with the Prime Minister's candidate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote on confidence until Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monty ' s submission of a limited list from a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Jorge Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them time.
In "democratic times are needed for the preparation of government and programme, he stressed, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understanding."
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The designated Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he also wished to include "policies."
The new Government would have to operate until 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence in Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to guarantee that Italy would become an important actor in Europe once again.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Rehn, stressed that "In spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, required, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss bosses of Emma Marcella, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that does not have growth cannot meet the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monty, known as his competence and independence to be a European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "mechanism" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism," a "professor" symbolizing "the cause of seriousness" and "the other Italy," according to the authors of the traitors.
The great unknown is the sustainability of his team.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid short-term elections, since by April 2012, Italy must make payments for public debt in the amount of Euro200,000 million.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
The Russian scientist Vájacheslav Danilenko assisted Iran in developing a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons confirmed on Monday an American agency specializing in nuclear danger.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of this United Nations agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possibly military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to IIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, "from the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods."
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company producing nanoalmazmas in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, prior to his return to Russia
In its report, IAEA referred to "the clear signs that Iran's development of the nuclear detonators system" was "worked by a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career in this technology within the framework of his home country's military nuclear programme."
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or remained unchanged.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing an increase of 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks against Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious offences.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
With the decrease in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, stresses Human Rights First, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," adding the organization to the official communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious violations of human rights," added one of the leaders of Paul Lejandr.
"The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, adding that it can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
"Racial crimes" in federal law are the legacy of the civil rights struggle period.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook.
On Monday, Twitter's microblothes site changed the presentation of its platform, which would allow users, inter alia, to see the activity of those they were following, which made the service similar to Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "name" tab allows for more easy and direct monitoring of the activities of other "twitters," Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you track, and those who track yours.
This allows them to learn if they publish messages if they sign new accounts if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested by "a small percentage of users in August" before being widely used on the entire network on Monday, and announced to AFP that it would be able to keep Caroline Penner's Twitter secret.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather vague and as using rather vague terms (RT to stop someone else's conversation, #flowfriday for recommendation to track other users), mainly enjoying experienced users, opens itself up for a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular social Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, the users discussed this innovation with the use of "tits" on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive, and it's too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter flow, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "gold rule" budget to the Constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats in Austrian power decided on Tuesday to write the budget rule in the constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible lowering of the Austrian government credit rating rating rating agencies (tropic A).
The Chancellor of Social Democratic Verner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with an Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, much higher than the upper threshold of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have had to pay interest of three thousand million euros more than every year, gave the argument of Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus met the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government had demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the German model, as Germany was the first European country to adopt the "rule."
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the federal State ' s budget in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, while land, like communes, should be presented with balanced budgets.
The aim is to force public debt to fall below 60 per cent of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2011.
Yoshikiko Noda
threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
The Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshiiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new foreign exchange market interventions if the value of the yen continued to grow.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, we explained to Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to the historical mark that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new record of power since 1945.
Since then, however, the yen has grown constantly, driven by the purchase of investors who perceive it as a "confirmment" in these troubled times of economic decline around the world and a debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic plan of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as Japanese products make Japanese products more expensive and reduce Japanese firms ' income from abroad when converting to national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), underlined Mr. Noda, who fears that this growth of the yen will kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent, compared to the previous quarter - for the first time per year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's fundamental economic performance.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Adzumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Manager of Hirohid Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "relevant steps" to understand that no additional mitigation on Wednesday should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the simulation organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros), raising to 55,000 million yen (519,000 euros) the ceiling it provides for the purchase of various financial instruments to feed the securities market.
Eurozone
The stakes are growing, stock exchanges fluctuate.
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended the bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.4%, and London was 0.1%.
Owing to the new difficulties in lending to eurozone countries in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"The troubled investors are just too worried about the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed down with a drop of 0.7 per cent under cargo of new market doubts about Europe ' s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has sought to look at Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," states Mitzusiga Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This is a return to concern about the future of the eurozone in a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1,3370, falling 0.4 per cent.
According to brokers, she fell after the Congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDS on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, including the possibility for a country in difficult situations to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, on Tuesday, Italian 10-year bond returns reached 6.85 per cent, while Spanish bond returns reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity period.
These difficulties with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monty, asked for time from the exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be a "core task" of his Government.
Spain ended up under the shelling of markets before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The gap between interest rates for the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Waiting for growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent owing to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised downwards in the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the Dogms
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after short discussion or by emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings have become an occasion to reflect on the share and location of nuclear energy.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed are examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, population development will double the electricity requirement by 2050 unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, China, India, Brazil is only a few who are strongly pursuing their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one installation to its kit by resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident in Tri Mile Island.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin ' s choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, by the increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be tangible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbin Champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest coal and gas consumer because of the volatile wind; hence, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than Europe's average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy energy prices are a key factor in competitiveness and in the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will result in a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about our country ' s new industrialization and protection of purchasing power.
The price most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
It is heavily export-oriented and attracts a whole range of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have to contribute a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros per year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer will order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if its manufacturer is scheduled to close?
In order to resolve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilial sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low carbon dioxide, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
Over 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Myle Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental effects
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error have caused tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters, an unprecedented force that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The scope of this step and cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, present a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy professionals who wish to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be an excellent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
The best mix of energy sources for our country must also be legitimately sought, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, Dogs and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various sides - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subordinate to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "human rights State."
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, who got into news issues when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación of 23 May) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters."
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and left agree in large measure on this issue.
The right-wing tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed would not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers" and by the left by Michel Rokar, who explained in 1990 that France "can not accept the poor from the world."
The difference is only in the level of generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the country by the Polish plumber was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Holland confined himself to blasphemities, saying that "joint work will solve our immigration problem."
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is cost-effectively expensive.
As the economists of Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that provided up-to-date data on immigration (Special people: How migration shaped our world and determined our future, May 2011, Princeton University publishing 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries hosting immigrants.
Immigration restrictions reduce growth and reduce employment.
The fear of immigrants' influence is based on the perception that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by causing lower wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary than they replace local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled are in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive effect on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity existing between local and immigrant workers leads to a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that growth by 1 per cent of migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (the United States Nobel Prize winners have a high percentage of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paipal and Yahoo have all been founded by immigrants).
Migrants also generate net gains in social security systems, averaging 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who has arrived at the age of 30 years will, for his life, bring a net return (income less costs) on average of 150,000 euros to the State budget.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to fit into the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to scare immigrants, have had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulaga, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that democracy should finally prevail over its enemies, that it was sufficient to vote and make it as direct as possible.
From Napoleon's time, "Malogo" knows it's coming from the superficialness of thinking.
A universal vote, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become a "addication instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Wasro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palnodia of a true-living Greek referendum will have a double lucid effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious change in policy and the precarious sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
That duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the view of many, Republican soldiers are now being kissed in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and chaoticly.
"Cart Blanch" for an absolute European monarch or jumping with bound legs into the collapse of nationalism - what choice is a citizen's choice!
No, we do not dream of guillotin blades, but of implementation - joint, clear and continuous - choices and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and there is no indication of how many others will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - Europe's crisis.
All Europe is totally accountable to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is completely humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of Europe ' s sovereignty, but Europe ' s entire sovereignty is gradually losing, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project under popular sovereignty must be restored as a matter of urgency.
Because Europeans can only work together to reduce the debt burden of everyone, to free themselves from markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it.
An exit from the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delor, all now require the European Economic Government.
Let's do it.
But imagining it without stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place is another insanity and a new impasse.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe, united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, genuine national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
End-of-fact chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World chip card exhibit is opened on Tuesday in Vilnius under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end 11% of the world's microprocessors sales (bank cards, SIM cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
The most important sector is the non-continuation technology sector, which allows public transport or purchase to be paid simply by mapping the reading device.
This year, the world will sell 460 million endless chip cards to 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (up to 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world ' s chip card market (6.925 million maps).
Europe, which has been behind Asia and the Pacific for a long time, is now moving forward in the area of indefinite payments.
About 26 million Visa bank maps are already equipped with this function, and 75,000 terminals are accepted.
France is starting more modestly, with 400,000 endless maps of Visa in circulation.
But big shops are growing faster.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million endless Pass MasterCards.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to equip their clients.
"The two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute bank maps adapted for non-continuous use to their clients in the future, according to Gérard Nebui, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But it's just the first step in the development of the future means of payment, that's the mobile phone.
So far, few machines are equipped with the NFC technology (Communication of the passing field) needed to carry out such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really fly next year."
"We count on world sales from 80 million to 120 million in 2012, " explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Qana.
The iPhone equipment of approximately 200 clients and staff will be provided with blankets that provide non-contamination payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing a market offer to allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
"The assistance that these two organizations use and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without giving details.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapping at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokur and Wensan Delori were apparently killed the following day, together with several of the kidnappers, during an operation carried out by French special units.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sym-cards belonging to terrorists.
Axle of Terror
An analysis of the calls was made of several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a nigger who lived long in Maidiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradles, and the other points to a person who is said to be close to Aqmi and a cult.
"This is a step forward, but there is certainly a need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"For many years now, it has been known that the cult has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active, " says Kunle Amuvo, Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, now exerts pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of uninterested enlightened people.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and at the Imam Foundationist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - what is "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict compliance with the Shariah, and its activists have begun to fight against an unjust central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks against police stations.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the cult is radicalizing and going beyond its northern tibias.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the attack that killed 80 people in Josa and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram launched the first suicide attack on a reinforced police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which comes from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger, and the Somalis from Al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during discussions with Presidents Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe, warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world is seen by Republican presidential candidates.
For China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a weakened crisis lead America to a complex world with simple, more specifically simplified ideas?
If we heard presidential candidates from Republicans, the voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been loud but lacking details of the foreign policy statement, which has traditionally been a strong part of Republicans.
The Luzungi concerning China, Iran and Israel ' s assistance are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of being nominated by the Star of Good Party, threatened to lodge a complaint with the Chinese in WTO and accuse them of "manipulating his currency is a sensitive topic for America, an irritated migration of entire industries to Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a commercial war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama in China, and the only candidate in the complex foreign policy, was unable to break the position that encouraged emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who stays in the bottom of the ratings, has not been heard.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he said."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also pledged to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to honour the promises made against that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidate's ratings, demonstrated a disappointing lack of knowledge of the cases.
He recently called against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power - obviously not knowing that China has already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks on Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
It also recommends that Kane, Perry, and the candidate Michel Bachman, be involved in the torture of suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
The current president's opponents answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone with regard to the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of the "children" from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which have given him the reputation of weak politics.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population considers the positive balance of national security at Obama, which eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that is tied to sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Potato, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North River Gas pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with the poppa.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated last Tuesday on the Baltic coasts, between the orchestra and the snacks, the opening of the North Flow, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiyon and his Dutch colleague Marth Rütte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the Russian gas flow into the Western European network.
Under the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will flow to Western Europe each year on a first pipeline of 1,224 kilometres, linking Leningrad region to the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same track is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project faced fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Flow will indeed allow the gas to be transported directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Pelja or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to deny access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing North Potok with the new German-Soviet Pact, implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security in its supply.
But the cost of losing Europe's energy is because the project created a bleed between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has achieved its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consumes large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already at its origin in less than five years.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, a new artery that organically binds us," argued François Fiyon, opening a gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
This explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom heads, who were present in a large number in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical development.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to bypass the minefields left since World War II.
"A hundred should have been removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the press secretary of North Potok.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake weight equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel beans, without rupture throughout its length, without ventilation or service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden wasn't thrilled that the Russian state company would settle permanently off its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we will close the gas flow in less than a minute," Jens Muller claims.
So, in case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to design stitches that are designed only once every 100,000 years.
Control of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a submarine robot that pulls the ship for external surveillance, as well as by an insider of the gas pipeline.
The cigarox apparatus shall be inserted into the pipe with a diameter of 1 metre and shall be pushed forward by the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
The gas cycling shall be carried out only by pressure of the gas.
It's 200 bar on board and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51 per cent of the capital.
The rest are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9 per cent each).
The five companies established a joint venture called North Potok, which was tasked with building and operating a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters is located in Tsug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of the amount of gas that will actually be transported," claims Jens Muller.
Funding for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30 per cent of the shareholders and 70 per cent of the bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be €7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the minoritarian shareholders are sure they're gonna waste their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
Gas pipeline comes out of the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sand bank planted with tail trees.
The ventiles of 4.5 metres high form the exhaust gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskin's brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return his taste to the letter.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent behind the letter in the light of candles.
Moleskine's locker is easy to learn from a rectangle black cover, in rubber, on yellow and white pages, as if it had been burned over time.
However, the recording book Moleskine, as we know her today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to market design notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant to the company, took responsibility for launching a new product.
It is inspired by the old machinery of production, the milk-clothed cotton cloth used, for example, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for vanguard artists until the 20th century," told Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of the brand in Modo Modo.
It's a success.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent to 12.7 million.
We were far away from the first years of production when only 3,000 blocks were made.
Moleskin has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set the profile of a typical buyer because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student and a man of a free profession alike.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks at the Fnac bookshops, shops in small towns centres, and has been able to gain widespread visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the emergence of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the "Bleet Way" exhibition, where architects and artists displayed their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with leopard rice on the occasion of a film festival in Lokarno.
Using its successes and cultural aura, Moleskin has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brand includes all kinds of support.
The success created by envy: Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund in autumn 2006, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskin.
Why is unemployment so high among disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled persons begins today.
Despite the public charity policy initiated in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice the average, namely 19 per cent compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disgusting?
"No, " says Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for disabled persons."
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times higher."
"One day there's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to the employment of a disabled person.
Among them are older persons: 37 per cent over the age of 50 (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor ' s degree, and of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, accounting for 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria, which make it very difficult to return to work and which constitute the essence of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire a disabled worker.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about the mentality that changes, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association under Cité's order showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "give themselves a full range of people in cradle or mentally or mentally disabled."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having the goal of having 6 per cent of disabled workers, as set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxed" organizations, like the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which raised the tax, created strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, particularly in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with workers between 20 and 49 have workers with disabilities, compared to 82 per cent of organizations with employees between 100 and 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting Sinimi on Tuesday night (20.45 a.m.), Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they enjoyed from this friendly match.
We're not gonna make it until we say there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
By sitting next to the arena of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar made their peace.
Five months after the departure of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only commend him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go on, "I assure Lill's player.
Which, until the contrast between his achievements at the club and at the assembly, is one thing, he is justified.
"I'm in Lille for a year, and Belgium isn't."
"I have to make glasses."
In advance of this match with France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar came to St. Dani to finally be "branded."
Not forgetting, however, the notion of "happiness."
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special nature of this match.
And especially what is on the other side is Mathieu (Debüshi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami), " he recalls.
"Just our roads crossed."
"A chance to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens was kind enough to remember the pride.
"Glory" to play the "felebrity match."
The Lordship also claims as a neighbor that France has become a "very high-level team" only one year after the injury in Naisna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunder strike, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly on one plane with the blue leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians grow," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure of it in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident in itself.
Portugal, Paulo Bent, is starting its response against Bosnia (22 a.m.) on this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt that the Pirate, which has been driving since September 2010, has been classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and Bosnia, which must be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in Hell of Zenica, it is clear that the game isn't over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for over an hour, it had failed to achieve a solemn goal that would calm it.
"It's a good result, however, that carries a certain risk."
But at their brightly lit stadium de la Los in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass in front of the public, who must be thrilled, although the match will be very tense," said optimistic, but judgmental Bent.
"We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 percent chance of going to Euro 2012," followed by Carnius Cairos.
No one on Friday's match against Bosnia demands a victory from the Portuguese.
No one could have made the Bosniacs.
"It's a good result, however, that there's some risk, " regrets Bent.
"We're gonna play against a team that has a lot of technical virtues and players with a lot of individual virtues," he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think."
That's a good idea, but this time it would be realistic.
