Scientists found an animal who can live for 500 years.
The International Biologue Group concluded that the longest-lived spine is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transfers RT.
Scientists carried out a radiocarbon analysis of Chrustalic eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark with a length exceeding five metres may be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in the long term of sharks.
Females of Greenland sharks only reach puberty by 150 years.
Previously, it was thought that the longer all the spine animals live the "cousin" shark, the Greenland whale.
The oldest species known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should we go to sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is Olga Bosch's principal sanatorium doctor.
And if a man is healthy, just tired of working, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need a sanatorium rest not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium environment, a person can check his body and get a doctor's advice on how to live, so that his health will not be destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be excessive to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and it shouldn't be taken away from it.
Persistent stress, mental and physical respiratory stress can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% of visitors.
People from large cities between 45 and 55 years of age are the most vulnerable.
So it's better not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest in time.
Research shows that 98 per cent of people reduce their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatorium offers comfort for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programmes that include both diagnostic services, paediatric counselling, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children ' s pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic physicals.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual testimony and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, a children ' s club with animators, where children can attend play classes, usually operates in sanatoriums.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for children's guests, provide breastfeeding with the necessary facilities and provide experienced nanny services.
The soft winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) creates good conditions for a round-year vacation on the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Water.
And then the body needs rest not just in summer.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are in the room and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for mature people.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasus Mineral Water is, of course, medical mineral sources: Slavian, Smirnov, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the organism.
Water varies by temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's feelings.
For example, Narzan has an anti-inflammable, immune effect, restores the functions of the ventricular tractor and the exchange of substances.
The "Essentouki" affects the stomach-boiling tract and reduces the sugar level.
The "Essentouki New" has an anti-inflammation, iron and urine effect.
The same effects have been borne by the Slavian water.
When appointing water, a doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks less salty water, because salts hold liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drinking at a certain time, at the required quantity and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of recovery, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, can be obtained from the resorts of the region?
There is, for example, a salty Lake of Tambukán near Fivegorsk, which is the mud of which is useful to the joints, the spinal cords, the internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammation, dissipating, immunifying effect.
It's a healthy walk on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest park in Europe).
It is popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source Narzan.
There are also baths in wine, pearls, iodogens, selenums, chaffine larcry, depending on what the doctor will appoint you.
Let's sell fertility.
What can we do to make the harvest go to the end of the season?
Says Julia Belopukhov, agri and a lady.
It's time for the tall tomato tomatos to have a haircut: remove new spiders, cut makeups, remove all leaves before the last brush with fruit and flowering with small bandages - they won't be ripe.
All tomatoes, regardless of "constitution," as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with solo superphosphate extraction, biopreparatus processing (Auditor, to accelerate the tide and growth of fruits, Fitoprorin-M, Fitolavin, Gamir, Baktofit, from disease, Immunocytophyte, to increase immunity, Bitoksibacilin, Lepidicide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).
The chemicals at the end of the summer should only be used by copper cuporos, colloid serre and green soap.
We're making the last plant pond.
Long-line cucumbers in the heater shall be added from the slappers so that the lower, tibia portion of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pour the heat water and the Cyrcone solution, and add the glass 5-7 cm compost.
Cut old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of integrated fertilizers, and put fertile soil under the bush, too.
In order to protect you from night colds, you will set a hole above a bunch of arc with hidden material.
Keep the plant open by day, and close the sun when it comes.
It's a sign of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia's withdrawal from the longest recession in the last 20 years.
According to the Bloomberg analysts interviewed, the Russian Federation ' s GDP shows a positive trend - GDP declined by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of GDP in annual terms.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Minegon Development have also recently declared stabilization of the situation.
In the front, slow growth.
According to CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession has remained behind and that the economic growth is slow ahead, " says Bank of Russia's bulletin, "What the trends are talking about."
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter by regulators increased to 0.4 per cent, with an estimate of 0.5 per cent for the fourth quarter.
According to the representative of Minecon Development, during the second quarter, the Russian Federation ' s GDP declined in the second quarter, accounting for 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleaned GDP decline was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April it was 0.2 per cent, and in May and June the GDP change was within 0-0.15, quoted by the representative of the IER RIA News.
The slowing down of the Russian economy during the last five quarters indicates that "the past has passed."
Among other markers indicating signs of recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg calls for an increase in demand for electricity and rail transport and a revival of business.
It is clear from the amendment that the year is viscosic that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus-minus 0.5 per cent of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko of the BROKER ALOR.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, the last two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia declined for the first time in five years.
If you look at the trend of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, the August outcome has been 12% stronger since the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the signs of recovery that should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," stresses Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, the Russian Federation has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
The decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The labour market has also shown positive trends, where unemployment has fallen to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%) below.
Despite the positive situation in the labour market, the real disposable income of the population should be left to the best.
In annual terms, the figure is down by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder economic recovery, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
Generally, their share in the structure of the economy is more than 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the rigid policies of the Bank of Russia are also cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator holds a rate of 10.5 per cent, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
The low level of investment, which hampers the development of industrial capacities, is also a negative factor.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the Russian Federation ' s economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent versus -3.7 per cent in 2015 " , said the GK Forex Club Irina Rogova analyst.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
While the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia are used by former foreigners, in most cases it is the harvest of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio, we can see the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians are flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality varies.
Some parents took someone to another country as a child without leaving a choice.
Someone didn't compete for a place in the Russian team.
And someone thought there would be better conditions for development in sports abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Only four years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
That's where she decided to go in the footsteps of her older sister to do light athlete.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose to jump on the sixth.
Stay in Russia, I don't think I could get Elena Isinbaev out of the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa, we're gonna be the only lander we've ever had, though the former, in Sector Six jumps.
Her best achievements in this form are the 2010 European Championships and the 2016 continental silver season, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
She was born in Newkusneck in 1986.
Her parents are religious promoters of the Evangelical direction.
Much because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight more children in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started to get involved in the struggle at school.
As a result, she moved to Colorado Springs, where at the US Training Centre she continued her class under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboniki.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first battle.
But at the World Championship in the same year, it's a victory.
Before that, by the way, she was able to win silver on the 2010 World Pleasure.
Then there was the 2013 bronze and the 2014 silver.
Mary was born 26 years old in Jaroslavla, where she first met a synchronized swimmer.
But saying that she was raised by our trainers in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
Mary continued her classes there.
She soon joined the United States team and showed excellent results on the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, their figures are ceilings.
A new name that Russians sounds strange, Christina Schaldybina got at 11 when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl an art gymnastics outside the ocean.
Until then, the girl had been involved in her favorite sport in his native Jaroslavle.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team in that country and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough, which brought out a star-to-peer team at the Rio Olympics.
Another of our ex-girlfriends is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany's team.
Jana was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had a better chance of going to the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, indeed, Jana was able to take only 17 places that were not enough to enter the final competitions in his personal front.
Two years earlier, however, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, the young ones.
Another gymnastics, just this time, Irene Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the above-mentioned athletes are standard, Irina's family choice is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a teacher at the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira's training in Russia, however, specifically comes to his home country to avoid losing his skills.
In Rio, she did not act as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multi-borough.
There are very few stories about Maria Ugolkov's swimmer in Russian information space.
For a very long time, Mary has lived and trained in Switzerland.
However, for a long time, it has been under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record of 200 metres of butterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and began to speak on a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in an integrated estafete 4x100.
In order to get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfanding project, which enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that enabled her to pay for the Olympic preparations.
A 31-year-old vocalist, Adam Batovov, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
In this time, the harvester of Hasawrt became a three-time prize to the European championships, the Russian championship, the master of Russia's sport of international class.
When he stopped going to our national assembly, it was time to think about the change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter has disappeared from the sports poles.
The triumphant return took place at the Asia Championship in 2016 - Batrov had already represented Bahrain, which had won the gold medal and received a trip to the Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-rossanin, Mikhail Kudinov, is known even less in his home country than even in the case of the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started doing sports gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40 jobs in parallel bruising.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympic Games are already a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her exercises with synchronized swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, a girl took her sixth place in a synchronized swimmer.
In the duet with Eugene Tetelbaum Anastasia, she took the eighth place.
She was five on the salt program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter is in favour of Israel's team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitri became the country's champion in 17 years.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
One year later, Crowther wins the gold of the Singapore Youth Olympics.
In addition to jumping up high, Dmitri has a long jump and a triple jump.
Albert is a 31-year-old native of Hasawwurth, who, after a long talk for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batrov, Albert chose Romania, which will be represented in Rio.
In Russia, however, he was in favour of the Redyarsk School of Higher Sports, even becoming the champion of the country in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the Soviet Union's team player in volleyball, Jaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before his son's birth, Jaroslav was recognized as the world's best volleyball player.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There's a family and there's a permanent residence.
In 2015, he joined the National Team as a bronze prize for the European Championship held in his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was joined by his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was the original target, but it was not possible to reach that northern country, but it had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to study the free struggle.
He soon won the first world among the young and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France on the fight tournament.
And again, a free fight, and again a former luxury.
This time it will be about North Ossetia's harvester, who emigrated to Spain, Tymuraz Frías.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is now in favour of a team in that country.
Before that, a 30-year-old athlete was able to celebrate high results in Russia as well.
He became a bronze prize for the 2007 and 2008 championships of the country.
The charter of non-disclosure, Tymuraz, decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahačkale, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
Arthur started to do boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, the Biyarslans won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why are the children of cascade classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, "they need to be systematically raised not by shares or parades."
They must grow and at least realize that they are casacks and education from at least seven years old.
But as long as this job seems to me, it's being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the cascades take on all the positive things that have been accumulated previously on a qualitatively new level, I will be pleased.
If it's all inhaled and unknowing, the new idea will turn out to be cheap populism.
ZKH continues to be one of the country ' s most criminal sectors of the economy.
There is a permeator of public expenditure from budgets at different levels.
According to the Attorney General ' s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of HQC.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid more than 170 million roubles for energy.
On the other hand, the Krasnodar province ' s prosecutor ' s office found that undue costs had been included in the tariffs.
In addition, 4 million rubs were placed on the cost of CIV Consulting (cold water supply) for rental of vehicles at a price higher than market value.
And these examples are the country's mass.
According to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged directly with several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund who was repairing urban facilities, Makarov had entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, they had not actually been carried out but had been paid.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
As the master of the CC, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spend it on their own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and to the tenants is millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov's machinations, uh, typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code who have contributed money to citizens.
The trial of A. Cohan, by the way, is continuing at Kamchatka, as well as the former member of the Council, accused of machinations of 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established six company managers in Elyzovo Kamchat province and established three limited liability societies.
One of them worked for the CC, two of them played the role of cass centres, i.e. they took money from the public.
However, the energy of A. Cohan did not transfer funds, but spent money on himself, the loved one.
It's quite difficult to judge in the ZKH area.
Cases aren't initiated, they're delayed.
And "helps" in this very complicated housing legislation, " says Svetlana Ruzrotev, Executive Director of the PKKH Control.
We don't have time to make one law, like we're making a new one that's supposed to make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on HQ issues.
Lawyers themselves recognize that housing rights in higher education have received very little attention.
The refusal to initiate criminal proceedings is also reported in the Department of Public Prosecutions.
Less than half of the 35,000 crimes in the proceedings in 2015 were prosecuted.
The rest of the investigation was prolonged and each fifth was suspended owing to the lack of identification of the accused.
Often, deficiencies in law enforcement are linked to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were some 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the five months of this year, the number increased only slightly - 99.
What is it about falsifying the housekeeper's record?
This means that the change in house management, financial and other questions bypass the opinions of the owners.
And it also means that the housing and community services market cannot be run by normal companies that want to work honestly rather than "do" the population.
So the tenants are in minus, small and medium business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the State, I am sure Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Property Committee.
This work is now being actively pursued.
It's not just a single action, it's a focused course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are so sad.
In particular, the capital doesn't smell scandals.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yeah, because the capital government showed iron will and made order, "AiF," Anatoli, elected, member of the State Security and Anti-Corruption Committee.
I am referring to both the human resources issue and the legislative amendments and legal education.
The management of companies has been subject to close supervision, and all of them have been licensed.
The complaints of the city are promptly resolved in the public space (and the treatment of the occupants and the response is posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many don't just pay monthly receipts, but they watch closely what's written in the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus Moscow checks the validity of housing and utilities tariffs because a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
It must all be together and explain the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you should change your place of work.

Will Erdogan be able to give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, put forward an ultimatum by offering to choose between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d ' état.
He said so by addressing his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support for the "fethollagist terrorist organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey that calls on the US to change its position.
Experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
" Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and THETO.
It's either a FETO coup or a democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice," quoted by the Anatoly Agency of Erdoğan's address on Wednesday night in Ankara.
Once again, the President of Turkey has already demanded that the United States comply with his demand, which he made for the first time following the rebellion.
We recall that, on the night of 16 July, in Turkey, high-ranking Turkish army officials attempted to overthrow legitimate authority in the country, as well as attempted the life of the Head of State.
However, following Recep Erdogan ' s appeal to the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, some 8,000 people were suspected of being in the ranks of teachers and scientists other than the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethhalla Gülen, residing in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdoğan's supporters also admitted that the U.S. could be involved directly in the coup d'état.
The Panel recommends no compensation in the amount of USD 1,436,430 for the loss of the claim for the loss of the claim.
The last statement made by the representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan ' s visit to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and also makes demands on other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to meet his obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels calls the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," announced on 9 August by the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik.
According to him, an amendment by Ankara to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Note that, on 1 August, Vice Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel of Germany demanded Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate visa treatment with the EU.
His words responded to the statement made by Mevlut Chavoucheğlu, head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made on the previous Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it met the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign States in the defence sector - they import missiles," Chavushoglu stated in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to establish its own defence system based on its own technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have sought others," the Minister stated.
The experts believe that all this reflects Turkey ' s serious disagreement with the West and its reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to hard confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West and business, and in terms of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient man in this post," the expert explained AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that following statements by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for a visaless space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States), he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will pressure him on humanitarian issues, dictatorships and so on," Minchenko considers.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change his position with Russia as soon as he benefits.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very hard stand against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey does not change his priorities again in time.
I think Erdogan's been involved in a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Having been between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to obtain the greatest benefit for himself," he considers Muhin.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to hold political power in the country, and for that reason he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which, through it, control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey," the expert considers it.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazov, took a different view.
Turkey ' s relations with both the EU and the US are tense, and this is related primarily to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I believe that this crisis will be exacerbated, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is not an accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, state that they are prepared to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, resolve relations with Israel, engage actively in political engagement with Iran," explained AIF.ru Glazov, which allows Erdoğan ' s next step to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, Erdoğan's policy is to return to the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the Arab revolution began.
"In that case, Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively in its "no problems with its neighbours."
The President of Turkey ' s very successful visits to Russia and Africa have now taken place.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and strengthen Turkey's position on both the regional and the international scene," the expert considers it.
The Glazza believes that Turkey's return to previous relations with the EU will be incredibly difficult, but now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond strictly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctor strike: Call for new collective protests
The representatives of the junior doctors requested the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new contract of employment.
The British Medical Association ' s Junior Doctors ' Committee (JDC) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that ministers had failed to answer questions about the contract of employment.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who voted in secret ballot.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Helen McCort said that the Government had continued to "speak silently" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the contract of employment.
She said, "In view of the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new contract of employment in its entirety and called for formal re-negotiation on all your issues."
In response to the Government ' s silence, the JDC leader today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse the ongoing programme of expansion of collective protests, beginning in early September.
The dispute led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the BMA junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after the vote to abolish the agreed terms of the contract of employment recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to be accepted during the meetings in advance of voting by 54,000 nurses and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract of employment would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Alliance of Bads"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed tight, and he hardly radiated heat even according to his own held standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, contrary to this, has repeatedly referred to his "good friend" Mr. Putin, five times according to one report.
I lost track.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant otherwise.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey hit the Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was unbelievable.
Mr. Putin broke up with an angry tiger accusing Ankara of blowing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger on the basis of an alleged friend.
The restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media have conducted a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were supposed to be guilty of everything.
The most serious allegations were that Mr. Erdoğan ' s own family came into the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it strongly.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim to win a sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrown last month in an attempted coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There's also an economic cause.
Russian sanctions have been severely hit - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when flights are finally renewed.
They're setting a peak end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Turists there, tomatoes back here," as stated in the report in the newspaper of Vedomsia.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West because she thinks it's a weak answer to the coup attempt.
Add to that her prolonged dissatisfaction with the skull of the EU accession talk and Mr. Putin's move - which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkish ties to the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities following the attempted coup d ' état.
You know, it's a gift to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analyst described me as "alyans bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Yet, despite the public appearance of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
Syria is key, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing parties.
Perhaps he speaks for himself that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, until the two Presidents gave a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and considering the possibility of a total catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey hit a Russian jet fighter, it is better that two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be classified as a Baxof, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC of Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has withdrawn from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and was to be saved.
During this period, the brand strategy was used by RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sports, from the Six Nations Cup on rugby to the Wembledon Andy Murray Championship.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Ulster Bank brand has already been used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the banking services of individuals who will gain more influence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during the tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming a bigger brand bank."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring sport.
"This is a good time for us to move the brand bank, because, on the basis (we asked ourselves), how do we focus on improving the bank for clients?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great customer bank and close all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on clients' needs, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori comes to 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket at the Pristerty.
Dettori's smashing champagne after the Newmarket oak brings him to 3,000 wins.
Jokey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home road - at the Pristius trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey, which has reached this remarkable mark in the smooth swings.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doom Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Edderi and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion of Dettori jockey, who had won Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm really glad it happened in Newmarket because it was where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night from 2,000 people.
I'm free from business, and I'm very unbelievable.
The children take applause when they bring the Preposition after victory.
Two jockeys have reached such marks in the leaps with obstacles: Richard Johnson's Jockey Champion and Sir Anthony McCoy's 20-fold retirement champion, who had over 4,300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
It's a style and strong one, but it's his tactical makeup that separates it from the other in the weight room.
He's a great representative for scams, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago to Eps, he'd bring 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and big races!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners in Britain for the most part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a strong character, which's good for the British races, but more so, he's an incredible bug.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a brand-in-a-horse fast snitch.
From the rapid finish to the rapid nipples, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades.
It was a takeoff and a fall.
Many of the winners of the big races, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ashcott in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was disqualifyed because of the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed a great deal of will to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And perhaps he hasn't finished for a while - Dettoria said earlier that he would like to continue participating in the competition, at least until the age of 50.
Putin is firing Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusting circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative of environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President" but has not identified the reason.
Deputy Mr. Ivanov of 2012, Anton Wyno, was appointed as his successor.
Mr. Wino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Hours (MIGI) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the Office of the President and the Government ' s Office, reporting the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his assignment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your work as head of State in drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told one Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his release from the post and recommended that Wyno replace him.
Do smiles win?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the Chief of Administration had resigned on his own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it wasn't enough to convince anyone here - especially now, just before the parliamentary election.
So, is this the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement - that the man who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - was met with a huge skepticism.
In Putin's comments on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult job, even if you may say a problem position, for four years.
Well, I guess I was the head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as did Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSS), which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putin's second term, since Putin's third term would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson was fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was involved in a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in filming and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which monitors the FBI team of agents, is expected to be provided later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a leading role in Darm and Greg's sitcom was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Creating as a criminal" and investing my heart and soul in it for the last 12 years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but it's not gonna be possible now.
I'd just like to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It's estimated that the show will be back with its twelfth season on September 28th.
Mystery: The fish landed in the Bunf garden
A man from Banfa sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain thinks 75 fish could have been sandwiches left dead by water.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, displayed this sight in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the emergence of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife.
Project 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the north overflight and the Quinsferry Crossing Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the Pole Veeras, which are now approaching completion near all three pills of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge Section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vant of bridge.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the interface between the vidad and the bridge floor is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79 per cent of the entire bridge sheet is now on site, for the last section of the sheet, concrete coatings are pouring into the Roche today, which means that everything is ready to climb on the bridge site.
Michael Martin, Project Director Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first link on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this linkage is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road sheet and connecting it to the expanding North Pylon road floor, we were left to close the remaining gap on the north - or on the shore - side.
This was done by subtracting the northern viaduk approach by 700 millimeters south.
It was a massive, yet highly sophisticated operation.
Large, because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to a slope of about 3%.
Funny because the clearances that the team was working on were tiny - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Saved in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men 's lucky to stay alive'
Three men were "gone to live" after they were thrown off a fishing boat to England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the incident in the Gulf of Molfr.
Three men tried hard to reach a safe place while their ship continued its course.
"We saw their ship spin around them and assumed the worst," said the steering lifeboat, Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Thank you, by the time we went down to the water, the wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, aged 60, was found to be insane and trapped in buoys without a life-saving vest.
All of them were raised on board a shore rescue boat and taken to a rescue station
Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The engine had an emergency locker, but it somehow slipped away from the man driving the boat when it got over.
Someone protected these guys today.
Pokémon Go, decent hunting for health and happiness
It's exciting to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, choosing to spend their free time watching screens, was a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go separates people from the couch and involves some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and lately smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the popular attraction of Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (after which a series of cartoons, play cards and other responses was created).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this has become more relevant a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was then delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, the smartphone players are looking for Pokemons, who are tracking GPS and, when found, can be photographed ' (through the script on your phone) or 'Pyman'.
The generation that played the game, when younger, joined the funny pursuit by breaking off the sofas to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a "normal" person every day.
Cardiogram, Apple Watch application, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people monitored daily 30-minute exercises jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, but it's just seeing primary level data.
Many health campaigns that convince people "to find 30 minutes," "to get out of the couch" and "to be active every day" have found no response because most health messages are boring and are spoken by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she's pulling people out to do what they love.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered: traffic, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends hunting.
As usual, there are boring dicks looking for something to complain about.
And, yeah, someone could hit the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphone applications, such as Fitbit, could already track our physical activity, they didn't give us a reason to learn how this game gives us.
Novinka's gonna sit down, and the use's gonna slow down over time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy in the hunt.

Simone Bailes wins the gold of absolute firstness in women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the crazy thing.
Simone Bailes is unbelievable for all this.
It's dynamic on a base jump.
Unforced on a shave.
It's stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Championship.
The 19-year-old American gymnastics went up to the title of the final champion on Thursday, placing the gap between themselves and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the close Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 was sufficiently distant from the silver medalist and the teammate of the Final Five, Ali Riceman, and the Russian bronze medalist, Alia Mustafana.
Bills of the United States competes in gymnastics during the finals of the female individual absolute gymnastics in 2016 of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bills became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of the champion of absolute firstness and fifth in general, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She went out when she showed her final overall score and her long journey to that point ended.
This achievement puts it in the same league as the extremely rare lungs, such as Michael Phelps, that have raised their sports to new heights:
Bills spent the last three years dominated in her sport by winning 15 medals of the World Championship - including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their mixture of work and precision that the 1984 Olympic Championship, Mary Lou Retton, called her the "greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was awaiting in Brazil, not so much competition between Bailes and the rest of us in this field, as between it and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to the family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an untrue expectation.
Simone Bailes of the United States, on the left, and Ali Riceman is hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final of the female individual absolute gymnastics at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bills earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for a probing party by Marta Caroli National Assembly Coordinator.
While Bailes insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that was not entirely true.
Part of her programme of exercise - the one that includes her trade pass - is based on Latin American music, which would fit directly as a house on the street outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandfather and grandmother as a child and an open mother of Coach Aimee Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach became a force.
She has not lost any competition in absolute firstness since the summer of 2013, the luck strip, which should continue as long as Bailes wants it.
Although Mustafa gained a little advantage through two turns, it was a mirage.
Hymnastic logs and vocal exercises - where Bayles defends the title of the World Champion - are ambushed.
She went forward again from 15,433 on the street and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Rysman hugged her softly while they were waiting for the final account - pure formality - and tears appeared around a bright red with white and blue leash for Bailes' eyes, when the idea she once recorded in the album for a cut was fulfilled.
Riceman's performance was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she divided the third place, but lost Mustafa's armor on the Thai-Brike.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call "boy" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise to return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
With regard to Bailes, a 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week is now completely new:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack on the first serial killer Finix in the last decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports issued on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lainer, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Mali, were shot dead on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, declared the authorities.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight shots from a pistol standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he fled on another vehicle, reported in the report.
The police claim that triple murder is not likely to result from the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallet or 2,900 dollars of an adult victim's possession.
Police spokesman Finix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted investigators to verify whether he had been involved in four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This is happening in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a branch of CBS, early this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan late in the 1990s, a black BMW late in the 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33 years old, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lyner, 31 years old, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and pulled the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephalia: "It's getting better."
Like most of the six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of her peers, Edmund's microcephalia is the result of a genetic disorder that his mom Elizabeth Pixivto didn't know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which, in fact, isn't true - of course you're signing for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to place him in a specialized treatment facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," explained Pixivto.
Edmund's walking.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund invented for "please sing me."
"We teach his sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may arise from a variety of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and projections may vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't actually ask for a life forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zick.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is a cause of rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi.
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until Saturday inclusive.
The numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and south of Mississippi have come out of the coast and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, and the National Meteorological Service has reported.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor ' s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were received for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Styl said that only Tangipahoa's parish had asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The risk of flooding remains until Saturday, most of the south of Louisiana.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could go to the area.
In southern Alabama, waiting for flooding was up to Friday, as rain continued to go to the Mobile area.
The Comit River next to Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Den Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a record of the flood level at the last weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Ruja.
He also said that the flood going down the river in Assenshen parish was a threat, as those up-to-date rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the border of the State of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Savers were still pulling people out of floods in the Amit and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi State.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pussy were among those rescued early Friday near Glosster.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that Beaver Creek's waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, quickly rose overnight.
He said that another pussy who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she'd seen in 48 years she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers saved all three of them with an army truck and brought them to the Glouster fire station, where they hid on Friday.
Krautmann says that the flood is spreading rapidly, as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingstone reported a fall of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was fed with rainfalls from the environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from homes in the parish of Tangipahoa and the abolition of classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that counselor Tangipahoa told us about 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both being flooded.
The president of Robbie Miller's parish said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
"They'll have the opportunity to go home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, the parish of Tangipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had in March" said the city manager, Lacey Landrom.
It's on the way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that the heavy rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but no one was registered on Friday.
Kate Touson, the head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tawson, "and she's still pouring on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "solved with bullets," remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
Grandma and Grandpa identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown got multiple gunshot wounds, including his smell, leg, hand, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was filled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Mellandse of the station said.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition and has experienced several operations.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade in local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in front of a car near 29 years in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shooting between several armed men.
The casings of semi-automatic weapons attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons were used to the site.
It seems like it was definitely a long fight.
There were casings on the street, both sides of the side of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," the station was reported by Captain Philadelphia Anthony Ginaldi of the police station.
Many houses and cars in this area were also hit.
No arrests were made, and the police are reportedly looking at surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hands of a Tuesday's ball bullet when she played in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call a women's Olympic gymnastics team this year and for several reasons.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympic since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnastics play a key role in this team: Simon Bailes, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernández, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Ali Riceman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like America at last.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American women ' s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnast number one was an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America applauded.
Now, the world could have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time Mira Simona Bayles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández championships, which are performing unexpected, yet virtual gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a woman ' s individual absolute front.
And Ali Riceman's teammate earned silver.
We're witnessing a peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnastics all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They're the final five because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnastics on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
But in reality gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnastics are first trained at private gymnastics clubs supported by parents paying for the cost of learning, equipment, travel, uniforms, contributions to competitions, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnastics and families) and the list is continuing.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnastics get everything from their trainings, and it's an expensive and long-term duty for gymnastics families.
Amy Burman, Coach Simone Bills, and Maggie Hani, Coach Lori Hernández, have both been training their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for the unmarked number of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin American) and national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people, who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gimnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to incredible work, discipline and resilience to mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's beautiful.
Sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simona, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Geneva Force in winning command Olympic gold and for motivated so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors took over the announcement of further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected.
The Ministers had hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to the amended contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce this treaty, saying that NHS was on "no land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in night work and weekends to improve services outside of normal hours.
Dr. Helen McCot, Chairman of the Young Doctors' Committee, BMA, said last night in a statement: "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will absorb the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors is reassigned to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The attempt by the VMA to resolve the dispute was met with reluctance to act and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not do so, then the junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to organize subsequent strikes.
The last pack in late April delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to replace doctors on the picket line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better weekend payment for 54,000 paramedics who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, encouraged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "The strikes reach little or nothing, but they exert pressure on the teams and services already on limits, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
The workers hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, the cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine, were an indication of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to meet the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A 2-200-day barrier can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use a drug of $2,000 a day after the authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer periods.
The anti-destructive ticagrelore reduces the risk of re-incidents for people with heart disease.
The barrier is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service of Great Britain advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people each year in England, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the accumulation of fat material on the walls of arteries and the formation of fucks.
If the fuck breaks apart, it can lead to a clot blocking blood access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already caught one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
The Tickagrelory produced by AstraZeneca, a British firm, sold under the name Brillique, reduces the risk by making trombotes less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of cycerlor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who had already had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke would occur - often with devastating consequences."
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that the cockroach, combined with aspirin, is effective when the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes is reduced for people who have already suffered a heart attack.
While we pre-advising the ticaglore, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of the ticagerore - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited after three years of expiry, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond that time limit.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the flourishing of the falsification of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mer Tauer-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, following a fat report from the Government
The culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eye, which has resulted in widespread falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the devastating report of the Government that has been issued today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former Cabinet member, is being criticized by the police, electoral observers and city administration for ignoring the evidence of electoral irregularities because of "excessive sensitivity to race and religion."
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to place cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identification cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters should simply indicate their name and address.
The report even proposes to put inks in the fingers of people when they put their ballot papers in order to ensure that someone can vote twice.
We need better protection for informants, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only to protect itself from electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street due to a scandal with a vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office owing to the long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had "in cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rachman, it was said, "has embarked on his campaign, based on the responsibility of the Muslim believers to vote for it."
Up to 300 votes were called into question or were the result of a person ' s personality when a person voted to represent someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He raised particular concerns about post-election fraud, where senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: "There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote on the will of seniors, especially in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.
"There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes on such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of "political correctness" to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the removal of political activists from the post ballot papers to stop the "voting of votes."
The report before Teresa May also calls for strengthened registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
Consideration is being given to requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use unsettled ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal ballot.
To remove political actors and activists from the work of closed ballot and post-election envelopes.
To give the police the power to set cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People ' s Act.
Make illegal photographs at polling stations.
Ensure that only English is used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff forces the voters to go to the box one by one.
Sir Eric is a violent attack on the city police, claiming that it was "awesome" that no criminal charges had been brought after the Tauer Hamlets case.
"The trial dealing with election issues disqualifyed Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts," he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt - a criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the galaxy" of the city's electoral registry offices.
Sir Eric said: "The final judgment of the Tauer Hamlets court was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bike analog and other two of the Olympic celebrities in Rio
The 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who appeared to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics are far from the only athletes fighting for gold this summer who can boast of their own famous double - at least reported in social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people on our screens, F Yours has drawn up a list of Olympics with more than a superficial similarity with the Hollywood Stars.
Hunter and wolf: A member of the US men's ray team Brady Allison, on the left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to double Kate on the bike track, many people online rushed to indicate how a certain ray would be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the US men's ray team, Brady Allison, caused a hurricane on Twitter after the images of him, which look frighteningly similar to Volk's star with Wallstreet appeared.
And in fact, the ray found out about the madness of the social media and admitted that he'd heard that he's been like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a huge similarity, maybe except vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt indicate even more this year: the striking similarities between the British jumper Greg Razerford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustaphaina, with her big visual eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg, they've been comparing with the star Hore Matthew Morrison for years.
Turning to the more unexpected, this user thinks Nathan is the "verbal version" of the actor "The Start"
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could be boasted of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist a swimmer from Russia, Julia Efimov, may not only boast of the same burnt skin and bright hair as an actress Anna Linn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like "the controversial version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte."
Hard women: Hope Solo's football star on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, on the right, have the same shapes of face and eye
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason underlying the similar appearance of this couple.
One Twitter user recently contacted the website to announce his fantasy that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the star of U.S. football and actress Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to Laura Lynny's identical smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabbie Douglas's gymnast, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which looks like Gabriel Union's smile of the star "Dobey Success."
The writer of the CBC Olympics apologizes for talking about the Chinese swimmer "death as a pig."
Byron McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-year-old position on a 4-200-m free-style women's estafét on the CBC audience Wednesday in a live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "stared as a stink" and "death as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his mic was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final female estafate of 4x200 m volley style.
You could hear MacDonald, who was attracted to CBC's commentator team to "smart it with color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ay Yanhan, who was 14 years old, sailed the second stage of the centafeth in 1:57.79 - by 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to close China ' s backlog.
The audience across Canada reacted quickly on the network after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlain said, "Isn't it really a CBC conductor just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China died like a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the finals of a women's estafate of 4x200 m volley style, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter critic immediately hit Byron McDonald, and many called him to fire.
Twitter users weren't held up when they heard how sensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote: 'Whatever is #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was conducting a CBC transmission, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, "We're begging forgiveness for the comment on the swim performance."
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
IFOR has completed its apology to more than 90 people who have been tweeting in response to this statement.
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize for McDonald's face.
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
I'm sorry, too, and I'm gonna make a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers on live television and our followers on social media.
Let's make it clear that Byron's comments related to the appearance of swimmers, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn't think his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's estafet',' he said at the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about the swimmer's speech, not about her personally.'
'Samo goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Primark's buyer insulted a woman who was obstinately trying underwear in the middle of a store.
Buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman was exposed to try the panties on the floor with the shops in the middle of the Primark.
Which is even worse, she's tried how she looked in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping store in Folkston.
Primark Trade Center Bouverie Place in Folkston, where a woman used to try tricots before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at the store at that time, said that after an example of underwear, a mysterious woman was "dressed and walked out of the store again without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a couple of panties off the window, took her own pancakes and panties off and put them on.
"She wasn't trying to find a safe place to do it-- she was just standing there, shameless."
"Everybody was tired when she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she liked, dressed and walked out again.
"It doesn't look like she cared about who was watching her, or what she thought about the man who would eventually buy those cowards she used to try."
A 33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's disgusting to think that someone's going to take home the cowards that someone else has already worn, and they weren't stews."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these clothes from the sale after she left - and that's better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find out that another woman put them on and took them off, and they weren't pierced."
The representative of Srimark said, "Primark knows about the incident that happened at our shop in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods in question were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assault with a gun using a krav maga
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the Crav-Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether they come to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and free the line of fire.
Then you tighten the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee is followed in the groove, and as long as the attacker is suffocated from pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, punch him in the face with a gun and go back, keep the weapons on him.
For an armed one coming from the front, the way to do the same is to get your body off the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and pull it out so that the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before you go back and target him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see how Miscary does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery - if you're not the master of the Crav-Maga - is to hand over your cash.
For a traveler, Jan Wright uses his tongue at the most dirty places in Europe.
The British traveler has subjected his immune system and vomit reflex to a serious test, bringing some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of the travel books, Jan Wright, 51 years old, from Suffolk, spent the euro's banknotes, the circus piccadili feathers, the toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of their immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is to be a film called "The Guide of the Liver-Liesun Traveler on the Internal Force," has produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking the leak button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about increasing intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing from the hustler brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known through his bowel's test, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public fare at the station to the button to flush the toilet, this task has certainly been tested by his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, "I've been completely careless about my health since I was a kid, and I've put a lot of things in my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused is a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test razor showed a luminometer value exceeding 4,000 units.
By comparison, just washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lurk after his luminometer value was over 4,000 units, while just washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film on a traveler called the "Inner Force Guidelines" which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as toilets.
In the film, he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the bathroom.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lizuna Traveler Guidelines for Internal Force" was removed with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Rita Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see at the same time could explain the benefits of the testicles.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestine is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to place them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestine is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was director of the film, added: "Let's just say that I would lose respect for Ian if he licked some things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some were rather rigid.
I'm glad that some of these bonds we've been able to film.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acidic bacteria solely to the good condition of the stomach and intestine, while 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added acidic bacteria.
The hooligan family destroyed Saltas, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of the eviction.
The hooligan family left its municipal house with a loss of 50,000 pounds after they were evicted for intimidation of their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were expelled from their real estate facility in Saltas, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the real estate facility, shocked housing and construction cooperative officials discovered the property site in a state of repair.
The walls were left with a sniffing hole, the floors were opened, the debris was spread over the floor, and the walls were graffiti evaporated.
The family is now resettled and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a resident in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this object of real estate is likely to be known as the not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad glory, and their name has a bad glory.
The couple had three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of the horror caused by the family included fights on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of the inhabitants of the surrounding areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and resentment.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behaviour in June.
In several rooms of the house, which could be demolished, they found old garbage.
The sex boards in the home where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner this week after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The settlement was welcomed with relief by the neighbours, who said that their lives had been transformed into a living hell.
One said, 'They weren't worried about anyone.'
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet, we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the leader of the Cornwall Housing Neighborship Unit, said that the family had been unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they regularly called the police.
Musor and old toys were scattered below the growing side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a shame that the tenant was unable to take any responsibility for her and her family's conduct, because eviction is always the last method of action to be considered by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case, because behavior was a limit, and their actions must have been terrible for its neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community, who have been brave enough to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that a social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in a house at different times, but said they all had a little more than 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the rubbish that surrounds the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g conopleys, as well as weights, related supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possession of class B drugs for delivery.
She stated that the money was paid for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were blew up by graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they're gonna try to remove tenants who don't comply with the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said that the eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can act without the prosecution's accusations, as well as for those who are harmed by such conduct' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flying military aircraft almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveira, in Portugal, tourists who love to sneak on the sun were terrified of their lives.
The aircraft P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it had carried out a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when the scared tourists start panicking, while the low-flying plane is sleeping over a crowded beach.
A military aircraft was seen on drama cadets, flying almost at a distance from hunters on the sand strip to Aweiro, northern Portugal.
The resting people jumped on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned by the noise of the aircraft's engines, but unable to see what was on their way through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveira in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few resters who published a video of stunning flight on social media, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment at some point that it seemed to be broken."
Nino Arroza added, "I've been surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveira beach were terrified when the plane came out of the fog and flew at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that a P-3C Orion pilot had conducted a training flight to detect fishing vessels near the coast and had to go down as low as it was the only way to check them out.
The pilot stated that the aircraft flew slightly lower than usual owing to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force made today a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the thick fog and was able to cope with forest fires that had worsened visibility
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to detect fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for more than a year for the general public, but most of Petersburg's cafes and restaurants have not yet been implemented.
Inspections are increasing and the business is facing fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For over a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for use by producers and carriers of food, as well as by companies in the general public in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Business checks by Rosquiradzor to comply with these standards began in St. Petersburg in February 2015.
But for the time being, officials only issue fines for certain breaches of the regulations (see "Translation of documents" ...).
Failure to implement the regulations would generally cost an enterprise of 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HASP, as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of astronauts' food.
The system is now being used in all food plants not only in the US but also in Canada, and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASP has been operating in the territory of TC.
The development and implementation of the business system was 4 years old (the HASP requirement was introduced in the 2011 TC process).
However, entrepreneurs themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the rule concerns only food production and not the vectors, explained to the head of the public council, Elena Ceteleli.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey - the end of August - is early September.
But they're not gonna be asked for a life-saving demand because their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, and they're looking at experts.
The Travel Agency Alliance sent a letter yesterday to the Government requesting that the charterers be allowed.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of a quality and accessible sea rest is unsolved, as most of the sites of the Krasnodar province and the Republic of Crimea have already been booked before the end of September," notes the authors of the letter and stresses that the opening of charters in August will not have a significant impact on the already existing demand for Russian sea turbines.
According to the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Tourism (RTC), if the Russian and Turkish aviation agencies quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will resume is not yet available depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build up programmes and agree with airlines on the required onboards," says Paul Rumian, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RTA.
He said that the possible resumption of the charterers was good news, but would not affect the placing of power on the market, because the main customers of charter tours - families with children - had already returned from rest and were preparing for school or taking leave in other countries.
During the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travellers and couples.
"Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Paul Rumian.
"Turkish has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if she is now offering very budget proposals - 50,000 rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of the Opto-Traval Travel Agency.
Otherwise, it's not worth looking for an alarm, but the bulk of the journeys has already been planned.
Paul of the Romanians also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charterers will also be required, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charterers is now a rehearsal of the next season," says Paul Rumian.
"The opening of the charterers to Turkey is a positive news for the next season," Valery Rubtsov agrees.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NPFL of compensation payments established by law, within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers employed in work with harmful working conditions is provided for under article 222 of the RTC.
In doing so, the rules and conditions of extradition are established by Order No. 45n of the Ministry of Health and Development of Russia of 16 February 2009.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs is made to workers on days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions due to harmful factors in the workplace.
On the basis of these standards, the Russian FNP concluded in the letter under consideration that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, of the NRK, the income of the NPFL in the value of milk given to workers in the days of actual employment for work with harmful working conditions, in accordance with the Norms and the conditions approved by the Ministry of Health Development of Russia by Order No. 45n of 16 February 2009, was exempt.
The Moscow Gastroybank remained unlicensed by the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the licence to carry out banking transactions from the General Commercial Bank of GASSTRYBAN, a loan organization registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GASSTRYBAN AOC has implemented high-risk credit policies related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have given the credit organization reason for the implementation of avoidance measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in suspicious transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank until the date of appointment to the competition manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization have been suspended under federal laws.
HAZSTRYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
We recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Act No. 177-FZ on the insurance of personal deposits in banks of the Russian Federation is set at 100 per cent of the fund balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles combined with one investor.
Payments, according to the Contributions Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the accounts, the assets of the AOC of GASSTRYBANK were 335 in the Russian banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Cadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is believed that she died of a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a convoy of factions in the country, as ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"I can only hope that the only advantage of all of this - as a threat and a will to others - is that it is the risks involved in the war zone - to convince people to ever make the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, the Sultan and two other schoolgirls from eastern London sat on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said that she married an ISIL soldier in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Chief Justice if elected
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, says that he is convinced that the democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will be nominated by Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday's conference call that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some confidence."
Reid's representative later said that he hadn't spoken directly to Clinton about whether she was going to move Garland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "paint the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who block the Garland nomination were "hosts" and "advisers" of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treets states that erotic calendars for 'women, as well as for men'
The Treets magazine is working with photographer David Bellmer to release the 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude museums.
President Treets Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to return to a demonstration of an eternal and classical naked figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a fine art work.
Models can present photos online or personally on open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscwichs are gonna be given a bag of unfair Internet magasmines.
In Moscow, they're going to release a bag that will tell us how not to be a victim of Internet magasin.
This was reported in Rosquiradzor, writing M24.
It is reported that agency specialists are preparing a bag that will help citizens to select the Internet store properly and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
This will be the general information and legislative framework, the rules for the delivery of goods, the means to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will make recommendations on how to properly formulate the claim and so on."
The memory is being finalized to date.
It will subsequently be posted on the website of the Moscow Rosquirnadzor, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and to deliver a Moscow version.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of the sabotage in Crimea.
Persons belonging to Ukrainian and Russian citizens who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zahtei Andrei Romanović.
"All of them give a confession," the report says.
Previously, a resident of the Zaporiv region of Evgeni Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty to interrogation.
The FAS will put Google on 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation of 438 million roubles, which is available on the agency's website.
"The cost for Google for the violation of competition law was 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fine soon," the Deputy FAA leader, Alexei Dozenco, said.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google provided smartphone manufacturers selling in Russian territory with a Google Play application store only if other corporate applications were installed on the device.
These applications include a search engine to be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the Act on the Protection of Competition (the abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that enforcement will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will benefit our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations including, inter alia, the Head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Office of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The government suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The New Bookstore Network is fined for selling the book Stase Kramer "50 days before my suicide," reports to the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rosquiradzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be regarded as "provoking or motivating the suicide behaviour of children and adolescents."
The Kornski District Court confirmed violations of the requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered the imposition of a fine with 49 copies of printed material seized by the Government of Rosbendazor.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was a work of Stase Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookshops were tested for a book "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow, the memory of Ernst is not known.
In Moscow, there will be a sculptor Ernst's memory evening unknown, reports to the TASS.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Litter House.
Unfortunately, not everyone can say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
Therefore, it was decided that this evening should be arranged for those who wanted to remember him on their own land," stated in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It noted that it was important for the widow of the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the unknown, including the poet Eugeni Evtushenko, the artist Boris Messer, the President of the GMI, Pushkin Irina Antonov, the director of Mark Rosovsky, and the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medina, the head of the Ministry of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, the deputy mayor of Moscow, Leonid Peachnikov, are invited to the evening.
It has previously been reported that Ernst's relatives are planning to have a sculptor pacher in New York until 14 August.
The ultimate consumer of wine: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like to blame.
And until you started to barge a section of the comments with gross insults under the pseudonym of the UnAll One-Mouschin Srednikh Lette, this claim is derived from the factual evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the rebirth of the plates under discussion is due not to a boom in a generation of two-year-olds who want to penetrate a new material subject, but to a nostalgia of medium years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering lovers - it has an emotional value: higher buyers of wine are more likely to keep their feelings in themselves (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and enjoy loneliness (69 per cent versus 66 per cent).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of the busy street of Soho, in a modest gray suit and a booze gesture before the stop, putting my hands together and saying something impressive, like, "Well, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charms and dirt - hotels, cafes, Paperchapshops have now filled buildings once occupied by independent sellers - several music stores with fantastic specialists have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to the various people in some of these shops, and I'm trying to assess their age and emotional attitude through surveillance.
Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, where I went from Sister Ray (accounting for two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years of age), to London for half a day to meet, and going shopping to take hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, as shown above (he sent me an e-mail picture, I didn't chase him home), go across the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge amount of albums and singles is partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they just got out and buy the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm buying is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things I probably was too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink much.
It's my fault.
Wez, 25 years old, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouTube profile.
He noted, however, the new wave of people exposed to media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the obligation to buy their old records.
According to the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
The clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among the rebirthists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weza, some of the older clients, in particular, are insulted by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl amateurs may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to move away from the constant familiar envelopes for plates, objects that awaken memories of an indecent youth.
"I think that sometimes it could be filling the void or possessing material things as a sort of calm," says Wez.
Because I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record room.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent had a player they never used, while 7 per cent of those buying the wine did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled by the story of Bosanowa.
The Trophy aspect of regeneration is what Johnny observed, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe (accounting for data: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently showed up and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our own," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More part of the product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, they're a little less than 20 who just know it.
Fopp, who now took almost the whole floor of the vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less unsustained than in the above-mentioned stores - the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, runs through columns - it's nice to see diversity in their clients.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds near someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at different records available on sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending the money.
She doesn't earn much, she says, so collecting records is not a very appropriate option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of the wine is "--- she's dulling in dreams with breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really not repeated.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: city fashioners.
While I'm creating an illusion that I'm looking at jeans, I'm watching a group of teenage girls meeting around the Polaroid cell every minute before dad and his daughter start talking about buying a Crosley player.
There's a ladder on the left, the wall of which is covered by the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynehouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory plates for any medium collection.
No one looks - perhaps because they're just jewelry, some are so high on the wall that it wouldn't be possible to touch them.
It's a real "holy vinyl" thing.
But given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho's depths for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
No wonder a segment of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury goods, such as wine.
But so far, my findings show that the results of YouTube are accurate, at least in Soho's records stores, and they do not exclude the existence of a vast number of female collectors and vinyl amateurs that exist in reality, in records stores and online forums.
These people are probably working all the way in school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend the morning of Thursday walking through the records stores on Berwick Street, casting records and avoiding the views of a 30-year-old fake lead who's hanging over the shoulders of no suspect middle-aged men.
The Greenland polar shark is the longest live spine of the animal, a video recorder.
Scientists claim that Greenland's polar shark has the greatest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the record placed a female between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
The French court rejects the offer to remove shops in the Jungley refugee camp
The French Court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to remove dozens of home shops and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
This week ' s court hearings have stated that the State should be able to bring down a total of 72 home shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer snacks or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or simple meals for several euros in homemade restaurants.
Kale's prefect was that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they bear fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free meals offered by the pro-Government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing size of the camp.
They said that home shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those who needed it.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people who run 72 home shops, but stated that the problems of the Kale prefecture "be fully understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who live "in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the space provided calm points for a meeting between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the Children ' s Café of the Jungle Book at the Camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes and counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that its closure would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under eight years of age."
Two charitable institutions, the assistance to the refugees and L'Aubberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number in the Jungley camp had increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest in history - following a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.

Britain stops at rugby-7 after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold.
The British impressive episode in Regby-7 was severely stopped at the final obstruction of Fiji's team in the final on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a master class in the possession of the ball, dispersal, evasion, support for the game, running lines and a rough power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of all colours.
The defeat came with the not too poor comfort of silver - Britain's third one in the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regby 7, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated.
Bocks, 7-5 in the semifinals earlier that day, could come back to have a negative impact on them in the final.
But regardless of anything, Fiji has won as much as the 15-person team can.
This may be some consolation for the UK - but probably not - that at least one British will hang a gold medal tomorrow on the neck: Fiji's chief coach, Ben Ryan, former British chief from Wimbledon.
It was some trip for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game of Adelaide Seven.
They only lost one here.
These strikes will cause pain, but progress is striking.
Fiji began to be great, trying to beat Britain's balls away for fun.
It was like hitting the convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinsau ditched into the corner.
With four minutes on Jerry Tuway's watch, he added another touchdown on the right flange that was implemented.
120 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to intercept Mitchell kept the man-gore Leon Nakarawa from beating the third one, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption, and there were still more minutes on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then blew through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and storm took the line to get an eye.
Implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby-7, while Britain still owns crafts.
Which, to a large extent, is true.
The United Kingdom made massive replacements for half the game, and they buried the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which, according to standards, was good for the first half until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK by making a tachdown in the left corner so that the score would be 36-7, but the game was long on the way to the island of South Mora, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the podiums.
The approach of Fiji could not have been admired by full joy.
Mata William painted a Fijian cake that didn't need to be adorned, another attempt in the last seconds.
There was a whistle, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and the United Kingdom slightly passed South Africa into the tense semi-final of one attempt for everyone - the difference between British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings the Bocks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work, broke the line and hit the balls in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, a brother of 15 towards the team of England, Anthony, won - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the coach's fight against cancer.
There won't be any more exciting gold in these games, and it's talking about something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy rises in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the additional value of their golden moment at Estacio da Lagos.
Although they were the two who were pulling the weight, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was always as long as they sought for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the annals of British sports that got to that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unsatisfied speech, once again unprecedented.
What we see is two brilliant athletes sliding around the surface with elegant swans, not fully reflecting the nature of the triumph.
For every gold, there was a battalion of ready hands who contributed to gradually growing victory, which was important, and there were no hands that were more important than coach's hands, which 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would survive before he saw the day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they could operate, and they did it.
If they don't do that, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's a little changing your species for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the inter-seasonary, maintaining a break in schedule minimal if that could be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the department - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet a time, even though they were talking a few steps enough.
That's how it starts.
Fucking on its own is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in trying to overcome their own feelings.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind his shoulders, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but that means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much I and Helen worked, and Robin did too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose any race in five years.
This couple is setting up a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too many in stock.
We were in a big phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to get warm and get out and win this race, which we did.
A couple will take a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own television adventurer Steve Beckhall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was a Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
"I feel so better," she said.
The Government has extended the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited from entering Russia.
The decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended on several occasions and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were banned.
The destruction of food imported into the country by bypassing the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were removed from the sale.
Hunting for "bank"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected on Friday in Moscow.
A atmospheric front will pass through the metropolitan region, which will produce precipitation and lower air temperature.
The air will warm to 25 degrees of heat by day.
For example, on the night of Saturday, a short-term rain will take place in Moscow, with the possibility of thunderstorms and wind explosions up to 15 m/s.
It is expected that the wind will rain up to 12-17 m/s by day.
Rains with thunderstorms are also projected in the Orlovsky, Kursk and Voronage regions, reporting to Dni.ru.
The next week, the draughts are unlikely.
The WTO Arbitrators ' Panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The rates of return exceed the commitments made by Russia at the time of accession to WTO.
"This is the first time that WTO has decided against the Russian Federation" is reported in the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "be systematic" or "are comprehensive."
Russia, in turn, pledged to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is mentioned in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia ' s actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is mentioned in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US conduct in resolving contentious issues in WTO undermined the organization ' s principles of discussion.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the American refusal to approve South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
In that connection, Russia would not address the question of Western sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation to WTO.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The President's administration has been replaced by a leader.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed former Deputy Sergey Ivanova Anton Wyno as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin re-routed the President ' s administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he believed that the anti-corruption work that President Ivanov had begun as head of administration was important and pledged to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, the Survey wrote that the experts considered the situation of the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the position of head of administration to be transparent and understandable and re-engineered would not change anything in principle in the administration of the Kremlin.
They note that the leader, who has been working for a long time in the President ' s administration, has effectively constructed AP activities.
He was replaced by the Deputy Chief of Administration, Anton Wyno, a person who knows the specifics of the work.
In Poland, it is allowed that they will not purchase fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish State Petroleum Company PGNIG does not rule out that a few years later, the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may not be attractive to it because of the shift to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogslav Magez.
His words are delivered by the TASS.
"Maybe we're not gonna completely buy gas (Gazprom), we're now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, LNG terminals and Norway," said Majez.
Gasprom now dominates the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had supplied almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of Russian gas giants in the procurement of PGNIG increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
We recall that on 22 July, the Polish competition authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture, Gazprom, and its European partners in the construction of the North Flow 2 gas pipeline.
In the same month, Poland left a request for Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic metres of the North Flow-2 gas.
This was announced by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board.
The North Flow 2 Auction will take place in 2017 and an auction is planned for the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action on the Polish side ' s intentions to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, and stated by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Board.
He recalled that, in the first quarter of this year, Poles only increased 42 per cent of the Russian Federation ' s gas acquisition.
Zampre Gazproma added that the mere fact that the Polish PGNIG had filed an application with the Stockholm Arbitral Tribunal did not yet mean that negotiations had been terminated.
The Polish company had previously approached the judicial office to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
We recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the Gazprom contract for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Government Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could, six years later, abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw is planning to build a new liquefied natural gas terminal, Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The "North Flow 2" provides for the construction of two lines of a sea pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first LMM castle in Ukraine.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, in response to the relevant question of journalists, is transmitting "RIA News."
According to OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored the three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The network produced a video of the Yak-42 passenger aircraft landing at Ufa airport, which went off the runway by 400 metres and fell into the left wing.
Video recordings published the 360 channel.
The EP occurred at 4:30 in Moscow time.
Krasavia's flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa's airport is operating normally.
The JRC ' s Transport Investigation Department has sought to determine the reasons for the rigid landing of the plane.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian town of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considers the fact to be undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which should begin at the end of August in Geneva.
United Nations experts have initiated investigations into reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
The first information on a toxic gas attack, suspected of chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in an area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been hit the previous day, the aircraft had dropped bombs with poisoned substances, but in Moscow the charges had been called a drop.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the opposition group Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zinki of what had happened.
It soon became known that the toxic-gas bombs were two.
This was confirmed by BBC as one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, beginning to burn my eyes, and it became difficult to breathe," quoted the publication of the word of the witness.
At least 7 people died as a result of the attack, and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told the journalists: "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is specified in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine used by the Syrian army against the "measured opposition."
The situation in Aleppo complicates the fact that its areas are being shelled daily and that terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.
As Reuters transmits, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in hostilities.
The current regime of a three-hour daily eclipse in the organization considers that "it is not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan ' s Adviser for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required for the delivery and evacuation of the sick and wounded each week to the city.
"We have to send bulk goods from colon trucks in areas where roads are almost destroyed and those left are mined," said Mr. Egeland. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its willingness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
How Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will operate every day from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to ensure that medicines, food and basic necessities are delivered to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the backdrop of the increasing international pressure on Moscow to withdraw the military operation and facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in Thailand ' s resorts, four people were killed.
There were several explosions in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people, wounded 19.
The explosion's epicentre came to Hua-Hin town.
Ten of the victims were foreigners, four of whom were Russians.
None of the terrorist groups had yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs had made it timely to state that Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing explosions.
Preliminary data from the local police indicate that the scope and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leader.
The attacks took place on popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phuket area and the towns of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, and Colonel Crisana Patanachareon informed the police.
While it was too early to talk about objectives, he added, however, in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, "are convinced that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
It's too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanachareon said.
But we know precisely that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact local sabotage, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to Police General Sithichaya Srispacharenorat, the bombs were detonated remotely at half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with tourist meals in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen are among them.
Russia is not among the victims of the explosions, reported to the press service of Rostourism.
Local experts also associated explosions with the referendum held on 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the country ' s population supported the draft new constitution.
He was prepared by a constitutional drafting commission appointed by a military junta.
The vote had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in electing the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
We recall that on 22 May 2014, Thailand experienced a military coup under the leadership of the commander of the army of the country, Pryata Chan-Ocha.
He said that the army had led to an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military had established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed protesters and the Supreme House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, at the centre of Bangkok, the victory monument, where a major protest took place, had two explosions affecting 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown motorcyclists.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and have engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
Conditions have begun to be developed in Sukhumi Logg.
As the JO learned, the Government is invited to agree on the draft terms for the auction on the gold mine site of Sukhumi Logg, with two key limitations remaining.
It is proposed that the auction should not allow companies with 25 per cent or more belonging to foreigners and those whose capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the State ' s participation.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
Auction may be announced in August and will take place in October.
The minerals introduced to the Government the draft regulation and terms of the auction into the largest undeveloped gold mining site in Russia, Sukhumi Logg (Irkut region, stocks and resources - 130 million ounces), and explained two sources of "J" familiar with the situation.
The project was launched on Wednesday evening, clarifying one of them.
In the Ministry of Nature, they confirmed "JO" that the project had been submitted to the Government.
A representative of Vice Prime Minister Alexander Chloponin, responsible for the mismanagement, said "JO" that the project had not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"Auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the issuance of the Government's order, and given the time limit for the collection of applications by potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may take place in October," they speak in the Ministry of Nature.
According to JO data, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as described in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FEVIs in July (one from JO).
The first is the presence of at least 25 per cent of the State party in the capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already written "JO" on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the shares and above) are neither tax residents of the Russian Federation nor dual nationals may be allowed to auction.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Dry Log is a federal nedramic (over 50 tons of gold).
In the Ministry of Nature, the project "sets restrictions on the admission of foreign companies" was confirmed, but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for public participation in the auction ' s capital was put forward by the Irkut region, spoke in December 2015 "JO" in the Ministry of Nature, and later confirmed by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rostech."
Who lobbyed the restriction on admission of foreigners, the "JO" interviewers did not specify.
"But in the spirit of time: not to give control to Russia's largest gold mine against the background of Western sanctions," the interviewer, "JO," who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donski, stated on 1 August that foreigners "may be able to enter a consortium" if the applicants bring them "as financial structure, technological partners."
JO interviewers think it's unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main claimant in Sukhumi Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold donor of the Russian Federation PAO Polius, under the control of the son of Suleiman Kerim Said, and the Rostech.
As "JO" wrote, in July, the partners created SL Goldo SP, where Polius has 51 per cent of the shares, RT-R-G-49 per cent of the Rostech.
In "Rostech," they rejected comments, stated in Polius that "unconditionally, they are interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competence and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the declaration of conditions," added in Polius.
ALDAS may participate in the auction, but the Russian Government's decision was made by the "JO" sources.
The Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, stated that they could participate in the development of the Dry Loga, while Polymetal and Nordgold reported that they were not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Gold Industries of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kashuba, in December 2015, estimated the "JO" investment in Sukhumi Log at US$2.5 to US$ 4 billion.
Most of the potential applicants have been scared not only by the volume of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and technologies to deal with complex ores is needed, explaining to the "J" interlocutors in the industry.
On the pension market, the largest M&A deal, CIT Finance Pension Administrator, started the process of bringing together the four NPFs under control.
As a result, the Gazfund of Pension Savings will create NPFs with savings of about 373 billion roubles.
The start of the merger procedure of the four pension funds - CIT Finance, Promagrofund, Heritage and Gazfond Pension Fund - was reported yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of the CIT Finance Pension Administrator's funds.
"Reorganization is in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-decrease in the terms of the existing contracts," as stated in the company's communication.
The association is based on the Gaza Fund for Pension Savings.
As noted by the Director-General of the NPF, Oleg Baloshitzki, the pooling of funds has several challenges: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replication of the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for the completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the market in the SBS.
As at 31 March, pension savings of pooled funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the Fund ' s website, the beneficiaries of the Fund ' s owner, CIT Finance Pension Administrator, are now Anatoly Gavrilenco (with 65 per cent of the OE controlled) and Gazfond (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched a much later competition.
For example, under the control of the O1 NPF group, "The Future" swallowed "Stalfund" as early as this year.
The combined NPF now joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Coercing into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to meet structural challenges," notes the Director-General of the NPF "The Future" Nikolai Sidorov.
The consolidation of funds has also been active since April in the Safmar-NPF-European, Education and Science-Regionfund pension group and should be integrated into the Safmar NPF until the end of this year.
In 2017, the NPF Trust will join them.
"The consolidation of funds will have an impact on increased risk control, transaction processes and costs," noted in the Safmar pension group.
Several reasons may be cited by experts in the consolidation of the funds that the CIT Finance Pension Administrator has retained.
Until recently, the NPF has not been able to buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively placed.
Following amendments to the CB regulation in March of this year on a number of issuers meeting the regulatory requirements, there are no further such restrictions.
If necessary, one major player may buy the entire output, " says the director of the AKRA financial institution rating group, Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF top 15 asset managers are another possible reason for the pause to call the division of influence and, as a result, staffing appointments in a single fund, which were to be agreed by the group owners.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenco was not available for comment.
Gazfond also did not respond to the JPF request.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and low-cost exercise, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As the Director of the Consulting Company of the Pension Partner, Sergei Ocolesnov, notes, has less outflows of the Pension Fund, the accession will stabilize the base of other group funds.
In doing so, better experience of the CIT Finance and Promgrofund NPFs will be sought in the construction of the retail sales of OPS, as well as in the use of a more modern software.
The CB ' s demands for processes and NPF ' s cadrams are constantly growing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, and considers the Managing Director of corporate ratings, Expert RA, Paul Mitrofanov.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will clearly outweigh the possible costs of unification," notes Mr. Mitrofanov.
The cost of bringing together the four Sergeant Ocolesnov funds is estimated at 30-50 million roubles.
"The cost of maintaining four such funds is about 400 million roubles a year, with a real reduction in the budget in the medium term," Mr. Ocolesnov is confident.
In Russia, the best movie, Pete and his dragon, was released.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the smart dragon, the ghost stories and country songs are enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic.
A scared little boy picked up a dragon that became a human child and a tender babysitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays with him in the chase and falls asleep in the hug.
Six years later, he, who grew up and in a vindictive bandage, no longer separates himself from another wild forest slug, Maugli.
In this way, Pete discovers a red-haired woman named Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the crew of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively driving the forest.
Now she's gonna have to believe not only in the existence of the dragon, but also to help save him.
Pete's fast-tracking "to be a man" course surrounded by Idilla Americans wearing cowboy shirts, moral code in the heart, and smiling more dazzling than any commercial.
No character looks and works too bad for the audience to really start hating him or scaring him.
Even Gavin, who opened up a hunt for a typical forest-owner, is far from an irreparable villain.
A huge, fuzzy dragon also didn't turn out to be scary, with a good face of bulldog, an airplane wave of wing, and the ability to become invisible.
Dracon's funny, cheating, even snoring, and fortunately doesn't say, but he's always gonna want to gloat, it's a lot different from all the famous kinematic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and manner of conduct provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small viewers but adults are desperately crying into three streams.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley as Pete, breaking apart between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is virtually delivering a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastic, lovely remake of the forgotten Disney film "Dracon Pete" of 1977, in the middle of a nose to the tip of a tail, remembering only a mix of animation and a play movie, and make it the most emotional film of this summer?
Not only did the miracle help.
In his original picture, Laurie actually took only two things: an orphan of Pete and a dragon.
Music numbers and most of the weird jokes left behind.
This good story reads the features drawn from the Bambi, the alien, and many other sweet hearts of children's paintings.
Disney's studio continues to be successful in expanding the 21st century's high-quality belt gallery.
Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't as stunningly beautiful as the same Jungle Book, and there's no skilled villain as Kate Blancheett was as a stepmother in the new Zolushka.
But this naive film is no less successful in believing in miracles and good in the best dysney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle will be once more - for the artistic film-adapting of the story of Peter Pan.
Worked in Pete and his dragon by David Laurie and writer Toby Halbrooks entered a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy on James Barry's single story.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge.
RRC lawyers Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing extremist activities, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found shortcomings in the case of their defendant.
We learned from investigators just yesterday that the D.A. made such a presentation.
We were scheduled to take part in a court hearing on the limitation of access to criminal records, but the meeting was not held in the end, and the investigators informed us of the presentation made by the Public Prosecutor's Office," which is the words of counsel, Olga Dinze, RRC.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had pointed out to investigators that there was a lack of qualifications and material collected.
The investigators will now have to fill the gaps in the evidence base and bring Alexander Sokolov a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (PC) will appear in the case or will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, please specify Ms. Dinze.
According to JO, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the charge the RRC journalist ' s language of "disturbing the political climate towards instability" and "conversion of power by illegal means."
ALELANDR ZILBERT, a correspondent for Kommersant-boscosport, lived in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian assembly house, lunched in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life's dying here for a second.
Even at night.
The last start sometimes ends at midnight, after which athletes need an hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, resettlement and eviction from the village are being carried out without interruption, as some athletes complete their statements and leave Brazil, and some of them are only coming here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations are drawn to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, " says the head of the Russian Olympic team's sports delegation, Igor Kazikov. " Despite the fact that the house in which our houses were located, consider it a model, it was put into operation by one of the first ones and demonstrated to all those who checked, even the case is having some misfortune.
That hot water problem, I'm sorry about the toilets.
We fought hard for purity.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cliners started to come, but they just pop some stuff on the floor, that's all.
They have floors, see, some innovative stuff.
Mol, you can't wash them in human beings.
Yeah, we know those floors, the laminat is common!
Anyway, we've got a change in the clining company, and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area on the one side of the mountains, with the other, an incredible mouth, with water.
And for reliability, there's still a two-metre iron fence all over the perimeter, along which the machines walk.
In total, up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in 3,604 apartments located in 31 homes.
On one of the 18-storey buildings, there's a huge Russian flag - this house is completely allocated to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, it is possible to determine at once what problems are likely to be most pressing for the national team.
There's two ads on the registration counter: "Please don't throw paper into the toilet!" and "I'll take the badge in my hand.
The bar itself drowns in booklets.
Their funly flowering contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: "The memory of infectious diseases for those travelling to Rio de Janeiro," "First aid in drowning, inflammation of an alien body in breathing routes, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiac and lung rejuvenation," "First aid in burns, heat shock, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, such as: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not all are waiting for a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a health centre at Russia's assembly site, which is ready at any time to provide the inhabitants of the home with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sporting massages.
On the contrary, the health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "Never mind, we'll win!"
And, of course, poetry:
All arguments are absolute bullshit!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let less of us, the sweetest taste of victory, Russia won't retreat, it won't break!
And for a greater spirit, there is an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Rusie Kirill, spiritual care for the athletes of the Olympic assembly of Russia is carried out by the protoyiers Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseyev.
You can order a maid and other tramp on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Medical and Religious Worship for all faiths in the village.
Well, the Russians, they do, in a privileged position, have their own chapel.
Because of the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, he tripped about the bodies on it.
Apparently, they were the sleeping employees of the new clining company.
I believe they decided to have a quiet hour at the cold steps in readiness to throw themselves at the washing of innovative floors at any moment.
On the fourth floor, I was awaiting a meeting with a long-standing acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubco, a coach of our Batutists who led them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He's with a teacher, a European champion, Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
I'm sorry for what I'm saying, but it's not critical.
Sanusel's one for four, but it's simple.
Of course it's funny, from fabric, it doesn't give rise to trust, but things can be put on.
"No, you're pretending they're out of tea!" he's handing out a tennis player, Svetlan Kuznetov, who I met at the main dining room.
It is known as the main one because it represents a space of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
It's worth 60,000 meals per day, free of charge.
The menu options are: "The best of Brazil," "The kitchen of the world," "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, macaroni products."
The last option, as I looked at it, is very popular with our volleyballist.
But let's say I didn't find soups in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soups?
It's a good thing I brought a Chinese man with me, a cookie.
And the kettle.
But in fact, in order to understand, we've got even worse food on the crusts.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable sameness.
I personally picked a pair of crumbs and meatballs in the tomato sauce.
A plate with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, together with an indication of the food value of the product and the presence of allergens, is attached to each dish.
Well, it's pretty good to admit, it's been a bit of a bite.
I don't even know why this line is always at the local McDonald's.
The selves, relaxed, can be said to be warm athletes on their way out of the restaurant waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're lured by a trap, a victor whose winner gets a T-shirt.
They're producing, you can say!
In order to get a gift, you have to answer at least eight questions out of ten correctly.
I've got questions on Russian, and I've been attacked by a girl from WADA.
But the wrong one was attacked.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic mood, naturally.
The situation has been exacerbated by the second question: "If I have received notification of the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I said, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost, so to say, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA doesn't have to wait.
Anyway, you have to be right there.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became very critical.
I somehow thought that if I was hard to keep a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and it's hard for me, by the way) I could use biosupplies to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
Anh, no, they won't!
In fact, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly, in several proposals, it is prohibited.
It's not fair playing WADA!
What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go - behind Efimov, Isinbayev, and all our bloody team.
That's why I'm focused, and I won a bad shirt out of the last forces.
Know what they say, ours!
In a winning mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
I've got a count of gyms.
He's down by 250.
It was surprising to note that no Russian sportsman had found any Russian athletes in this wave of runways.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who doesn't know how to play!
There's one of our guys sitting in a nearby clinic.
In turn to the octopus.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
At the health centre, however, as in the village, no matter where the plumbing is, there's a condom machine.
There's an encouraging call on him: "Go with the horse."
The only way to do this is to roll a blade that resembles a door lock pen and a condom made of the natural Amazon latex is to readily drop out of the machine.
I took one for my memory.
They won't get away from the athletes, they got 450,000.
Just for the holiday and celebration of the Olympic village, there is a whole entertainment centre.
He has a knowledgeable sign that reminds me that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in a variety of ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiard and tennis tables, desktop football and hockey and some weird devices like video practicers.
- I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team who actively uses a diconic toy.
You could just say you don't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian team, that's all.
By the way, there's some weird pattern in the eyes of the guys in the blaze.
The most playable team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to bypass the whole village by looking at every corner of the village.
But if it's to walk, not to ride electric cars, you're gonna open the house of a Canadian pick-up with a salmon at the entrance and a back-up, and a ticket office, and a laundry and cleaning room, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with the goods of everyday consumption, and a mail with unique stamps (only you can't wait from Chinese philatelicists), and a bank, and an apprentice, and a photocauce.
And later in the evening, you will sit next to the olive tree, with various coloured tapes to remember friends and relatives of the athlete who left the world.
And you're gonna be under a car composting fluid for the death of insects, thinking about forever.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop in this village for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching the Australians almost punish American Dream Team, real fans went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Derigaz won gold in the rapire at the XXXI Olympics, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm even the only moskwich who saw how it happened, except for those, of course, who watched the Carioca competition that night.
It can only be understood by a true cheerleader.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors at the bottom, as always by the hour of the night, wake up and begin to scream in vain, but they are very loudly yelling at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's no time to go to the market in the kitchen and buy a new plumber, as the plumber asked.
There's nothing on the television schedule, so I just kept Mach, First and Just in case of Rossius - although it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the country of the reverends, all the sports are there for some reason in the record.
There's TV live on it.
The hope, of course, of "Match," was a whole evening young man screaming in news releases first about the great semifinal of Deriglas-Shanaev, then about the future fight for gold.
It'd be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the US-Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put Americans in a place who were so fucked up by their own greatness.
As a result, they lost, but as we now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's okay, but there's a fight with Dee French, and there's no change on the screen.
In a light panic, I'm starting to lick the channels.
It feels like they're spinning for the second time.
All right, let's go deep, on cable.
None of the thematic "Matchi" fags are on.
Oh, I feel like fighting is about to begin.
I'm not comfortable with the text and tweeting of some sports sites.
Sugar surfing is unexpected, but it's brilliant.
The First website provides direct technical transmission of all competitions that take place at this point of time.
I'm going to festivities, getting a gold fight.
It's a great counterattack, it's going forward on the glasses, and obviously it's starting to take time.
Italians play almost the whole thing.
Our one point ahead is just over two seconds to the end.
Dee Francesca throws himself on Deriglez, she retreats, time ends, Italian gets shot.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic Messinger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Insane, faithful, involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (UDM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM prisoner ordered his imams to preach Fridays only on Tatars to force young Tatars to learn their mother tongue.
In the administration, it is stated that this "in no way interferes with" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some of Kazani mosques, it is said that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of the parishes, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons on Tatar "will not reach the audience as a whole."
Yesterday, the Tatarstan plenary unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in Tatar.
As the Mufty of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin said, it should be an incentive for young Tatars to learn their mother tongue.
"For those who say that it's heavy, in every big mosque we intend to organize the Tartar language lessons completely free of charge," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today, in all mosques, the preaching "should be already in the Tatar language."
He recalled that the Tatarstan DUM published a magazine called Shura with typical preaching in Tatar.
Imam, who doesn't speak Tatar enough, "may be able to prepare for them thoroughly."
The Tatarstan DUM brings together more than 1,000 parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, in Kazani, Russian was previously used primarily in a number of mosques.
In particular, as Mufti pointed out, this was practised at the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniller.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed the task of the leadership to ensure that all students have the two State languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no abuse of Netatar Muslims," said Mr. Muhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself is "not a compulsory, essential part of the prayer."
In doing so, the prayers will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons will be maintained in Russian in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "JO" that there was no serious threat that the Tatar language could be removed from the mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the preaching work in the Republic.
The decision of the DUM was strongly supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCT).
The head of WCT Rinat Zakirov said, "Yeah," "Meths are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tartar language had gone out of this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language "the will of the imams themselves" but in the WCT "considers it right."
The "JO" imams interviewed who were preaching to Russia are willing to implement the decision of the DMM, but they believe that there will be difficulties in understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand language.
Of course they're gonna be tight.
"We have to rebuild," says the Imam of the Burnaev Mosque of Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, even a large number of Tatars are closer to preaching in Russian because "Russians and schools, and children, radios are everywhere in the first place."
However, he believes that the mosques will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held in other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show you the way out of this."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," he says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the preaching will be "to reach a more narrow circle and will not reach the audience as a whole."
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the outcome of the preaching work will be different.
But time will show.
"I'm just gonna feel better, for example, because the Tatar language is my mother," Gabdullah Galullin concluded.
Former Director of the FISIN has been brought to trial
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office has confirmed the indictment on the criminal case investigated by the SSC concerning the theft of budgetary funds allocated to the Russian Federal Service.
An ex-President of the Prison Department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion roubles to the FIS, will appear before the court.
The Attorney-General ' s Office has sent criminal proceedings to Zamoskorsksksk Racuda against Alexander Reimer, former director of the Russian Federal Federal Federation, his former deputy Nikolay Krivolapov, as well as Victor Oddenov, Director of the FHP, Information Technology and Communication Centre of the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences.
Depending on the role and extent of their involvement in the commission of crimes, they are charged to the SSC ' s Moscow Office under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of official authority with serious consequences), which is article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (mechanism committed using its official position, in an organized group, at a very large level).
In addition, Crivolapo is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CSR, in 2010-2012, the individuals in question were fraudulently abducted from the State Treasury by the budget allocated by the FIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budget money, the group developed a scheme whereby its CITE-controlled enterprise, with which the relevant government contracts were entered into, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets," and implemented at prices that had been overestimated several times.
Despite the lack of production equipment, buildings, facilities for the construction of production capacity to enable the completion of the electronic bracelet production cycle, five State contracts, worth more than 3.3 billion roubles, have been concluded between the PHSO and the FIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, over 2 billion roubles were recorded in the accounts of the Sami branch of the FMG, of which 1.2 billion were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million roubles of cash were allegedly received by Mr. Reimer personally in his office from one of the co-parties, for whom a separate criminal case had been made available.
Nicolai Krivolopov, who participated in the machinations, had found an unknown source of ammunition for a reward gun, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, with a volume of 133 volumes, the FSIN has filed a claim for compensation of 2.7 billion roubles.
The football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of being involved in the journey.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched his family ' s two houses.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s - the beginning of the 2000s attacker Hakan Shukur - is wanted by the authorities in connection with the attempted coup d ' état of last month.
Forward, who completed his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group."
This is the Hismet movement, a society associated with the famous Turkish religious activist and opposition Fethhullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdoğan who is the organizer of the military coup attempt that took place on 15 July.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of a former footballer.
According to the investigation, his father was also involved in the organization of Fethullah Gülen, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
Haqqur, a football player, defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and advocated for the country's assembly.
He spent most of his career in Galatasara.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as English Blackburn.
True, he didn't spend more than one season in either of them.
Hakan Shukur is still the most effective attacker in Turkey, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 broken balls in his asset.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his office as a result of an ongoing corruption investigation around Erdoğan party and its immediate environment.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurryyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and association with an opposition Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, residing in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media officers may wait for long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian movies, which cost two to three times less than for foreign production films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for viewers with large Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 paintings per year in our country, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even it's very hard for them to compete with Transformers and the "Glory Man" who's in charge of huge budgets," the film director said.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum "Tarida" began work in Crimea.
Participants include artists ' teachers and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian backgrounds from all over Russia and a number of neighboring and far-reaching countries.

New York City, the new contractor promises to surrender Zenit-Aren by 26 December.
The new contractor in St. Petersburg, who is expected to host the match of the 2017 Cup of Confederate and the 2018 World Cup, the Metropolitan Company promises to surrender the arena by 26 December, reports RIA News, referring to the head of the Federation Council ' s interim commission to prepare for the 2018 Vadim Tulipov World Cup.
"Today, with Russia's sports minister, Vitaly Mutko visited the building, with us was the CEO of the Metrostroy, Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd give up the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious Petroburg company, it never breaks the timeline.
Vitaly Mutko and I have been satisfied with what we saw and heard," quoted the interview agency.
In the past, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to examine the venue for the upcoming major competitions.
Mr. Tulipov also noted that the Sovfeld Commission, which he chaired, would continue to monitor the progress of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction of the stadium.
Last night, it became known that Metrostroy would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the contract cost would be about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won tenders for the improvement of the area around the stadium, the contract cost is 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with AO "Transstra" Corporation, the Enterprise Corporation Trans-SPB and the Industrial Corporation Transstra were cancelled.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the stadium.

In Miassé (Chelabina District), counsel for former Vice-Guernator Nikolay Sandakov Konstantin Akulic was detained.
According to the South Ural, another defendant's lawyer, Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulic, was called to the Miyass Investigation Unit today to charge a case of one year's time of beatings.
At that time, Constantine Akulic travelled to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to assist one of its participants.
"It was initially initiated against unidentified persons, and now that he began defending Nikolay Sandakova, it was Aculic," Serguey Kolosovsky considers.
Konstantin Akulic became an ex-Replacement Governor ' s lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before calling a lawyer to the Miass SK, the defence advised that the time limit for hearing the fraud case, accused of Nikolay Sandakova, was due to expire on Monday.
We recall that two criminal cases have been brought against Nikolay Sandakova.
In the first (fraud) case, he is charged with a promise of 1.5 million roubles to facilitate the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk as Chief of Administration of Lake Eugenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nikolai Sandak allegedly received from the Director of Pyton, Igor Kalugin, in the form of illegal and non-reimbursable property services amounting to at least 1.3 million roubles.

The Russian copper company (RMC) is prepared to assume social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has taken over the modernization of one of the country ' s oldest and most environmentally dirty enterprises, the Karabash copper mix.
The Karabash copper factory was founded by an English shareholder society led by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was an important industrial enterprise for the country ' s economy, and it effectively ensured the life of the entire city.
However, production was stopped in the 1990s due to financial problems, causing serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash Medemel Combinate.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash plant, the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabash had already been notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation in Karabashmedi began to change in 2004 after the enterprise moved under the control of the Russian copper company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was also recently noted by Boris Dubrovski, Governor of the Chelyabin region, who visited Karabashmad in early July.
The head of South Urala has described the enormous changes that have taken place with the business since the Karabashmad was transferred to the RMC group.
The main modernization exercise in the last few years has been the construction of a new sulphur dioxide plant that captures up to 99.9 per cent of metal gases.
According to the President of the Russian Medical Company, Allvolod Levin, investment in the project was about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of the modernization of the Karabashmad ZAO is the reconstruction of the convertible.
The replacement of three converters, pawns, the gas-road tractor is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion rub clean-up facility is planned to be launched at the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes credited to the budget of the city of Karabash will increase.
Over the entire duration of the Tomin Goza project, from the start of construction to the start of the second phase, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
After the introduction of the GMA, the entry of taxes into all levels of budgets can amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
Over the year of work in the Varnen region, 346.3 million roubles have been allocated to different levels of budgets.
And this is for the first year.
"The longer the company's success, the more it can be," added Valerie Ulaanbaatar.
The RMC specified that tax revenues from the Miheev GKA were close to 1 billion roubles in 2015.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax contributions.
The RMC enterprises help repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural entertainment facilities, and the Territory ' s welfare.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Medical Company in Karabash was the major renovation and, in fact, the almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten by 95 pupils.
The building built in 1960 was in an emergency condition.
A landscape park with artificial ponds, underground parks and ground parks will also be located on the territory of the RMC Arena, with 600 machines, cafes and sports shops.
The RMC Arena will allow for visible professional sports activities at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical and sports in comfortable environments accessible to the people of Chelabinski, especially children.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation because of the hacking of Democrat servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the entry into the Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama ' s administration will reportedly have to formally accuse Russia ' s servers or the Russian authorities ' hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other United States intelligence agencies are almost confident of Russia ' s involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to indicate the names of those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 entry into the Sony Entertainment Pictures database, for which the DPRK was officially charged.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who implement or promote cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, writes a publication.
Even if officials concluded that the hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the consequences before the disclosure decision was made.
They will have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it exacerbates tensions in bilateral relations.
It has previously been reported that Barack Obama's administration allows for sanctions against a State whose hackers hacked the Democratic Party's National Committee's servers.
WikiLeaks has published an electronic census of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the break-in.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles.
The reason was a breach of competition in the mobile application market.
The antimonopoly proceedings were initiated on the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provided smartphone producers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited the pre-fixing of applications from other developers, in particular the Yandex.
The FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position in the market and imposed on the manufacturers of mobile devices the installation along with Google Play other applications.
On the basis of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google and announced the name of FAS leader Alexei Dozenco.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the competition law must be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, in turn, intends to study the solution first and will only then be determined with further action: to do it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that contracts be adjusted until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to do so.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, discussions with Google on the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement were under way.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This view was expressed by the lead analyst, Mobile research group, Eldar Murtazine.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The Anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon.
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racist.
Using the "Lings" Snapchat tool, it allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border with absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to pick up Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Lynzes are rough, sparkling features of tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become known.
Linza Snapchat was criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of individuals or encouraging the white people as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week offered a lens that gave them pussy eyes, toothbrushes and powdery cheeks, some critics considered it to be a racist cartoon on Asians, "Jeltolics."
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to the more serious diversity-related problem of the company.
On Wednesday, messages and a sign of resentment were distributed in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after the Snapchat announced that it had been removed.
The company commented: The lens was conceived as a tribute to the characters of anime, not as a cartoon for Asians.
But the experts who know about racism aren't aware of it, the lens has reminded us of abusive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail to Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "absolute and at least awkward."
She added that "it was hard to argue with a comparison by side of a very rude Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow, but highly humiliatingly yellow.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and Davies, which we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat - who are more diverse than their older generation - can mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image offensive to the user, then she said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Ju, "this is a much more difficult course of events to stay invisible, as it used to be."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and engineer working for the Midium, decided to delete their record in Snapchat and called on others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were a cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snowchut.
Ju criticized the predominantly white management of a company consisting of only men and finished her article with a chashteg: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is Chinese, wrote: "They have not had enough white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they do not hold positions where they can speak safely and openly."
Other observers share her view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its personnel, but according to the trusted person, the company recently hired a rector to focus on underrepresented populations and to actively attempt to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Ju said that she would keep her record in Snapchat closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them they wouldn't do that."
Military leadership distorted ISIL intelligence, reported to Congressional Commission
The U.S. Central Command officers changed intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than was the case on the ground, informed the congressional commission of a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the Task Force, established by the Republican Chairmen of the House of Representatives Committee for WS, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widely widespread dissatisfaction" among the Central Command Intelligence Analysts who claimed that the leaders had led their assessments of American actions to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military agency in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by Centcom's superior command generally gave a more optimistic picture of US counter-terrorism actions than confirmed by real data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies" was stated in the news release of the report.
"What happened in the Centcom is unacceptable: when the higher leadership seems to be in a bad position, our military is suffering," a member of the House of Representatives, Ken Calvert, a Republican from California, said.
The problems with management in the Tentcom are reaching the top of the organization.
The 10-page report deals in detail with the gaps that continued to arise in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered false reports, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events," reported in the report.
For example, Centcom's official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at returning Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, that's certain," said a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service's highest management forged command intelligence documents to reduce ISIL's threat to Iraq.
The Republicans created an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that the intelligence of the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow the report published on Thursday.
An additional, pending investigation into Centcom ' s intelligence is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the United States House of Representatives Intelligence Committee published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom established an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and the Iraqi security forces," states in a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, the chief representative of the democratic party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, "detained the issuance of intelligence documents," damaged the morale of analysts and "not sufficient to reflect divergent views."
But Shiff and the Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to expose them to "a given or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Best.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by Chief Inspector Pentagon, which was opened following the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress report while the Inspector General ' s investigation was ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of integrated data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as the Ministry of Defence now claims).
But last year's statements make it doubtful whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide accurate assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State repeats disputes over a decade ago when the intelligence analyst of Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research article alleging that President George Walker Bush's administration, because of the protest by many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hucker team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes at oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State had not led to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four consecutive times in a women's hockey on grass, bringing it closer to a decisive battle with Britain.
The one who once scored three goals in a match that ended up winning Japan with a score of 6-1, Katie Bam opened an account on Thursday by the first two goals for the U.S. women's hockey team on grass when Americans won India's team with a score of 3.0.
Five heads in two games should be a memory achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I can't put it on," she said.
I'm not really the kind of guy who's tracking his gols.
That's what she knows: America's 4-0 account in the Olympic Tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbelievable after Japan's 2-0 loss on Thursday.
British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday at the last game of first tour.
Both teams claim a quarter-final, and the outcome of the game will determine who's gonna take the first place in their group of six teams and who's the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little while when the quarterfinals begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that Americans here made noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in London's games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, took a hockey club on her grass when she was 3 (her senior twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't go to the finals.
Then 2012 came when she and her teammates failed.
Next year Coig Parnham, English, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
" Cultural change, psychological change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we now have.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account at the first half of the game with a rough hand on a short distance.
India has come to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team has shown itself to be surprisingly tough and kept the 1-0 account until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative into her own hands.
She made a long walk with the ball down the left side of the field, then she walked into the middle of the spiral and sent the ball to the gate, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first one on the US gate tournament for Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parkham, but how good it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the controversy of the Olympic Games, "Dzen" jumps on the tramp.
Wherever you are, no matter how much time now, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio seem to be constant and inevitable, a monstrous combination of competition and aspiration.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's that burning torch that's transferred from the ray to the swim, to the gymnast, to the triathlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbors in turn at the cafe and not hear about Simon Bailes, Katie Ledeka, or about the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first player in the Olympic Games, a handsome man with a pit on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities that are shown in the pyme-time, promoted by sponsors and life-confirming commercials if he was a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a pheatomer.
But the 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic jumping contest.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events equally.
From the centre, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally accepted: shooting with a pneumatic gun, shooting from the onions, Badminton, Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long kingdom.
But if I am allowed to speak for my own personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the bat.
Although jumping on the bat has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many people interviewed by me have not been aware that they are in the Olympic sport at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States was sending athletes to the competition, they never won medals on the bat, and their athletes didn't go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian tend to share male awards and Chinese and Canadians are women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the jumps on the bat have an autsider ball, in particular because for the unenlighted ear, they are more associated with the circus college than with the Olympic Games.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, but a land-based enthusiast.
They do have a comic potential - caricature milling of unending jumps - but also gymnastics and jumps into water, two sports that they mainly combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín" meaning "tramplin for jumping into water."
The winners jump on a giant bat, taking nearly 30 feet into the air, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, folds and salto) before final landing on their feet.
They are assessed by execution, complexity and "time of flight" according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
The applicants for the medal should go further, faster, higher and higher in the gold chase, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, to the field.
They seek not only to the finish line or to the starting wall, but also, in view of the telecam, to another teasing frontier: the world or the Olympic record.
It's a persistent desire for noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it's enough to make even the viewer climb.
But I think it's a bit exhausting when I see the game.
He's the one who's jumping on the bat.
The direction of the Batutist is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she goes up, looks like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort up again.
And they certainly don't have any competition or difficulty, but there's no madness in the finish, no jumps in the length, only a wonderful, elegant loss of time and gravity.
It's the closest thing to a Zen Olympic sport.
Women ' s qualification competitions, and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast an hour in Eastern Europe; men will be on Saturday, also at an hour.
NBC will broadcast the finals of the day program from 14:00 each day.
At the height of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can easily be seen in the common dump.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by putting men's athletes in the head and objective manner - as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the hymnists from the United States - Douli is only waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"The Generation Contests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing United States ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators, who required political change in Ethiopia, faced intense opposition from the Government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa ' s most stable countries, a firm ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months anti-Government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
Only in the last week have thousands of people come to the streets demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was cruel.
Witnesses claimed that police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from protest sites allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It was always hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it would be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia ' s economy is developing at impressive speed.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has hardly been a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently referred to government repression - opposition in the territory of the State has been blocked by the fact that dissidents have actually been silenced.
Many of them have been sent, imprisoned, killed or expelled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly repressed and left with no other options but to protest, the rebellion will rise," said Seym Teshom, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use, to the seizure of government authority by the coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely removed the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling deep into the heart for several years, are rising now.
The first one seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become routine and Internet services have become better.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through a proxy server that hides where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that that was what they organized to protest.
Second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, two of the largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it also changes.
"We shall act together under the same command," said Mulata Gemech, leader Oromo.
Major protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that in Ethiopia, members of the Tigray ethnic group, who constitute about 6 per cent of the population, are unjustly dominated by military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is Meles Zenawi's loss.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have predicted the danger.
Analysts argue that he was particularly skilled in recognizing the first signs of displeasure and using intelligence to get data and clear the enemy.
"The foreign regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, appeared nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who originated from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southern country.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
Ethiopia was the last to experience such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts had said seemed to have been the elections that the Government had stalled and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest was relatively rapid.
Development experts expressed appreciation to Ethiopian leaders for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new inter-urban train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the increase in internal discontent by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhar, attacked Tiger-owned businesses and anti-Tigerian hatred on social media became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this tight rope," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to close the last conflict that covered his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican party's presidential candidate to approach the American people wisely.
It also embarrassed his deputies, who tried to protect him during a period of unrest, because they had to explain the statements he probably had not meant.
After saying this assumption at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded ISIL.
But in his post on Twitter early this morning, on Friday, Trump wrote that he was just eating.
This post was a direct contrast to the allegation made only one day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When the Radio Conservator Hugh Huitt tried to help Trump ease the speech by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, the Republican party presidential candidate did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The latest scandal broke out when Trump tried to refocus its campaign on the economy against a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton have spoken competing about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to get back to this subject.
He warned once again that Clinton's plans would increase taxes, and said that she was boring.
Trump used sarcasm earlier as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he came to a general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond the political discourse allowed to speak and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way to test some of the messages that come up with a response among his fans, to watch them act and then "explain" them in one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed both candidates' language.
But I also think he's careful about his remarks and knows they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the speech for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more ulcerous tone in recent days, while its ratings continue to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump was giving up Clinton with a big overweight in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and was heading toward Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have embarrassed his loyal allies: they have to publicly support him, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputy Trumps, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Julianie, when he was asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama ISIL was an almost unknown little organization, he called it non-threatal, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, allowed ISIL to develop as it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for disenfranchising every word he said and biased against him.
He was mocking the "poor, unhappy" television experts who were trying to solve it, and he said, "We're weak!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuses as an unnecessary confirmation that he was not fit for president.
Once removed, the coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
Verb's coffee shop was capped, taking only a cash place in Williamsberg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room from the Bedford Avenue window.
The Soup Sherie shop, which took place in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The local residents mourned her as the last loss in a modern city.
The artist Molly Krabaple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But although New York is constantly changing, it is in turn being updated.
Verb's reborn coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
There's Wi-Fi in the new Verb, and they take credit cards, but there's some of the same employees left there, and there's a simple atmosphere like that.
Besides, coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisco Rodriguez, a long-standing staff member of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager in the new place.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said he'd be happy to do that.
Rodrigos, 36 years old, left much behind.
Verb works with the same baseball distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It's even made of old Verb lusters.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new meals.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese and has toppings from capers or roast onions.
There's a drill rice dish.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but now they're making fresh-eyed juices.
In nine months, Rodrigos said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
"A lot of ex-clients also pulled out prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
In a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
She said that she stopped drinking coffee for a while after the closure of Verba.
"I realized that it was coffee and atmosphere that I was impersonated in Verb," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although on that day, instead of a normal ice-coffee, she ordered a bathed tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing.
"In 15 minutes, eight, every day, like the clock, I came, and for me, my butter ball and all the stuffings were cooked," he said.
Rodrigos told me he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Tonight, Rosental still makes a routine order, but one day he changes something with bacon, eggs or cheese on a baseball with all the stuff.
Rodrigos said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap shop once had the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri have offered to make special soap for Verb using coffee from a coffee shop prepared coldly as a ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodrigos.
The permanent residents of the Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodrigos said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local point for the sale of juices is planning to spill bottles and sell coffee prepared coldly.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was killed in grief when they closed down.
When the coffee shop opened up in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long ago I wanted to feel this scent," he confessed.
Depressive food of depression in the "Plot Trapee"
In March 1933, shortly after his election to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt went to dinner in the Oval Office.
As a gourman, President Roosevelt loved the fashion dishes of Fifth Avenue, such as the fua-gras and the Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: pharmacized eggs in tomato sauce, potato pure and dessert pudding from prunes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to feed."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in the history of food.
The last book of Cowa, "Rago in Chinese," was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told the story of life in a filmed apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "Dom 97 on the Street of the Fruit Garden."
Their new joint work on the "Plot Trapeza," which will be published on Tuesday by Harper's publication, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
In some way their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop dinner, a tiny, simple diner in the Fletairon quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of Birjev's collapse.
Zigelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and sandwiches with a piece of olives, and Coy, 57, took turkey, potato pie and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple thought it was the appropriate starting point to discuss food in the depression era.
"Rouletes used a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roll, a wheat roll, a beer roll.
They were made out of the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to spread.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coo's freaking out.
"He must have been in the stomach with a rock," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups were preparing for male farm workers, and fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I that described how the country managed to stop being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, challenging subject for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally difficult: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and bakers, became basic foods; the ferret is "a beautiful way to dispose of the boots," Zigelman noticed, because cooks could hide non-appetite ingredients under the thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People tried weird mixtures because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary sense.
By researching a book that includes prescriptions, Zigelman prepared a dish of that age: a baked onion, pharmacized with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dinner table wasn't successful," said Coe.
Zigelman added, "It was really weird."
The peanut butter is completely off the bee onions.
This was characteristic of many homemade prescriptions.
More than ever since, housewives - including Louisa Stanley, the head of the Federal Home Economics Bureau from 1923 to 1943 - have managed the country's food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become budget contributors, accept a challenge and transform a burd like a burried spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
It's a pie of interesting historical facts.
The Government ' s response to hungry citizens, for example, President Herbert Hoover ' s position in the spirit of "Let the pyrogies eat" is particularly picky.
It's a pubic, simple farm builder of the state of Iowa at the time of his childhood, eating like a sophisticated millionaire who became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, such as the cucumber sauce fish," told Coe.
He ate practically in a gold canteen, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantasticly cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economic who wasn't interested in taste at all, which led to the "consumption of the White House" not only of the worst food in Washington, but sometimes of the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the depressing culinary receptions were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Zigelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they learned better about the food habits of Zigelman's mother - that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of neglecting food," said Coe.
Zigelman recalls, "She totally poisoned people."
There was one nasty case of prophytroles.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert they made at home: the porn dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a prune muss," said Zigelman, adding that it was a common reception to give modest recipes to the name of the cross.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everybody's snuck a spoon in a viscos, brown, liquor.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe asked for extras twice.
He said to his wife by the voice of a confident budgetmaker: "A little ruble walnut wouldn't interfere with it."
The arrest of figures of the case of mass strife in the Khovan Cemetery extended until 14 November
By 14 November, the Presnen Court detained the figures in the case of a mass fight in the Khovan Cemetery, granting the relevant request for investigation.
There are 14 accused persons in the case.
It will be recalled that on 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, with the use of weapons, fought a mass attack at the Khovan Cemetery, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and the lawyer, the co-founder of the public organization Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation, Olga Holodec, during a visit to the Brian region.
We have specific parameters as to how much pension needs to be raised to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Economists are now summing up the half of the year, and we will complete this work in the next two or three weeks, quote the Holodze Interfax.
Commenting on the six-year increase in retirement age proposed by the Head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Cudrey, the Vice-Premier reported that the topic was not being considered in the booth.
At the end of July, it became clear that the Government had agreed on a position to fully index pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan were at the end of a small-caliber rifle shooting competition.
The Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Kirill Grigoryan were at the end of a small-caliber rifle shooting competition from the status of the league at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - a new Olympic record of qualifications.
Kirill Grigoryan was the second to be the second to the 628.9th.
Only eight of the best athletes went to the finals.
Kamensky is a world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethullah Gülen requires an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d ' état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état," quoted Gulen as the French newspaper Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish opposition stated that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denied involvement in the coup d ' état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
We recall that the attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of legal counsel during a dispute over a patent from hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of legal aid that she incurred in connection with the patent for hepatitis C medicine with Merck & Co Inc drug manufacturer, and the Federal District Judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was relieved of the payment of $200 million for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of irregularities by Merck, including lies under oath and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, the U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to recover the costs incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work based on the sophosbuvira, an active ingredient of Gilead medicine.
Armed forces supported by the United States claim to have intercepted full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The armed forces, supported by the United States, seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State fighters in the city had left, the group ' s representative reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after the departure of the remaining militia group that was hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by militants, told the Reuter Agency Charfan Darwish of the Mabija Military Council ' s alliance with the VTS.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuter.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her 2015 tax declarations, which showed that the presidential candidate of the democratic party and her husband had 10.75 million dollars of income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced a $3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice-President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, issued tax declarations in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency," stated in a statement by the election headquarters adviser Clinton Jennifer Palmieri.
In total contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to make his tax declarations public.
This is a common case for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers identified the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax declarations.
"Your move," wrote on Twitter by the election headquarters adviser Clinton Jan Sams, referring to a declaration by a candidate from a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the tests were completed.
The critics of Trump, including the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 2012, Mitt Romney and other Republican fellows, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the issue and released an online video on Friday, which focused on outstanding Republicans who convinced Trump to publish tax accounts.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the debate on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, without exception, to publish his tax declarations," she said to the meeting.
The newspaper Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the businessman of the New York Times had quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who believed that cases might still exist.
Federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule named after a billionaire, an investor named Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS verification, and that Trump was afraid not of tax collection agencies, but of voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua in New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index equity fund, and Clinton announced dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder and fireworks have increased the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an innovative way to prevent elephants from sneaking into human settlements, leaving condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, joined with the American Committee for Nature Protection to promote it by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many used the spears earlier to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"since we invented a set of tools... we've seen a change in relations within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they can keep the elephants away from their fields without hurting elephants," said the Executive Director, Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the border-breaking elephant and signal the horn.
If he was unable to escape, the so-called chili cloud would be abandoned.
The chili powder mixed with soil is placed with cotton in a condom, and the end of it is twisted, and only the fithile is left outside.
When the condom is lit, it collapses with a bleach, spreading small dust to powder chili in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant on the other side.
An extreme measure is a launch device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country since the coup d ' état of July this year.
This data was given by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlüt Chavoucheğlu, in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we have withdrawn 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 did not return without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy agency.
We recall that in July Turkey an attempted coup d ' état took place.
The authorities have officially stated that the coup d ' état has failed, as well as reported the detention of more than 6,000 persons, among them high- and middle-ranking military officers.
The attempted coup d ' état killed 290 people, according to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin Hotel for removing Israel's telephone code on "please" Arabs - reported the RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin had a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin had no Israeli telephone code, and employees referred to "probations" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary on the Holocaust, Shawa, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the telephone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which it was possible to call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
I wrote Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel office counter.
The answer he received there, according to Lantzman, "smashed him."
The hotel clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move was even more angered by the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lanzman, a hotel employee.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as "a terrible shame," reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany, and it's this hotel network, is even more embarrassing.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusion," the official said.
The case caused a great deal of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that Kempinski's hotel was simply "got about" the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"Would be cool," said another post, where it was said that a hotel located on the glorious street of Kurfurstendam was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has rushed to cancel any charges, calling the incident "unsight" and "porry" to Lanzman, reports the newspaper Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list," quoted by the representative of the Kempinski Hotel, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian student protesters
Students faced the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The disorder began when police officers tried to disperse students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to proposals made by the Governor of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protestors were seen writing on the graffiti walls against the interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place only a few days after protesters went mass into the streets to support a suspended President, Dilma Rusef, when the country's Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - reports the RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagaryan of Russia in Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was an increase in interest on the part of Russian firms in business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will be visiting a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, Russia ' s diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with certainty that last year's record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to twist the huts in the defence and industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was "systematic non-compliance" by the Director-General of the Conner Almaz-Antei, "dismission" and "loss of confidence."
The NGO leader has been appointed Gennady Bendersky for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal of Neskorodov only appeared on Thursday night and did not cause widespread media resonance.
How can we explain such silence in the face of the massive rearming of the army?
It is likely that the Russian leadership does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This proves once again that the defence and industrial complex (ODC) has many problems and the State does not want to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of industry policing.
Alma is the head of the connor, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based anti-aircraft systems.
Alma is currently in the process of establishing the Poliment Ready and Morpheus, which are planned for new corvetes, frigates, Esminians and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia Dmitri Cornev portal believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is due to the disruption of the project time frame.
This version is the most logical one.
For example, the development of Morphea began as early as 2007 and the introduction was expected in 2013.
The "Pleament Ready" should be the main air defence system on the latest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, no truly successful test has been carried out in several years.
True, as far as I can tell, this is not the clear fault of Almama, said Cornev.
The expert fears that a delay in the entry into service may also occur with the C-500 ARC.
The project ' s development work has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes are expected to enter the force.
In the Ministry of Defence, they believe that "work is under way and will be completed within the prescribed time frame," although in 2014 the agency recognized that there were problems with the development of C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that project interruptions could be both the cause and the cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PKI and business management plans.
It received a long-term order of tens of billions of rubles, and big money is known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defence companies withdraw from positions of their own choosing, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to other jobs.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that Almama's leader may have been a figure of touch and resisted the "orders" coming upstairs.
It appears that the State no longer intends to tolerate such conduct.
It will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence and fail to perform the tasks.
At the same time, the Russian Federation's leadership is seeking to punish provocative managers (Star shiplifting).
The President personally pays increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin chairs the Military Industrial Commission and holds periodic meetings on rearming.
The Kremlin protects the leadership of the PLO, seeking to have a loyal composition of directors under its hand, who will comply with the orders received from the top.
This is a far-reaching policy, but in the face of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the PLO, there are no other tools available to the State.
The current defence situation, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the PLO, the leadership of the Russian Federation has taken very successful steps to enhance the professionalism of the Russian forces.
The army ' s personnel have acquired a new quality with the arrival of the Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoygu.
It seems that the President has taken over a famous saying, "Would you like peace to prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the limitations of the bipolar system, it worked well.
The lack of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were proof of this.
The patio of "winners" in the cold war ended with the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world," there seems to be no quiet corner left.
In spite of the overall trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of equal partner.
Under such conditions, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and reach the new borders of world politics.
Scotlander Kallum Skinner's running straight to the finish line, which brings the British to take over bicycle gold.
Scotlander Kallum Skinner ran to the triumph at the men's command sprint in Rio last night, thereby protecting British command trio from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old born Glasgow was the strongest girl that his buddy, Sir Chris Hoy, had made his own, and the young man was proud to have come into history, running straight into the finish line to win the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy had completed his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist from Jamie Staff.
They did what they did when Lindes appeared.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kean Emadi and Matt Cramton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man who was held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the Hoy champions four years ago, and Skinner set the Olympic record as a qualification, but the standard was superior to New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation, where Hindes went on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindez's eyes when they joined the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a stairwell comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted intentionally to fall on the track after a failed start.
He later rejected the comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain's competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost on so many races with a world name that winning Olympics was amazing again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 names of races both in Beijing and London.
If it's a barometer of progress over the past five months, then the bike will be waiting for five more successful days.
With Kenny's form, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeats Hoy's performance by winning three Olympic gold medals in one game.
This would make it possible to see Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave's birthday, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) bringing his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old boy from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have knighthood."
It was the only play of medals in the day, but there was some good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clansy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are qualified to be the fastest four-kilometre team race for persecution in four.
They finished for 3:51,943.
The world record set for gold winning in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will be the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualification train, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussell Sand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgawi improved the world record by showing time 4:13.260.
The British Command came to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take over the middle of the Olympics and earn a bunch of medals.
After, in fact, exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second plan, not the last one being the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April because of allegations of sexualism and harassment, and the departure of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the race of the first evening on the cycle, it seems that the legendary glory of Britain now in reaching the summit at the right time may be about to happen again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria - as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers - is threatened by the fact that the power company that provides the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, is planning to terminate the delivery contract: all delivery contracts are planned to be terminated.
This is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
A 20-year fixed grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs - directly and indirectly - may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of the total electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metal factory in Point Henry, which closed down the Englesy power plant last year.
The Portland metallurgical factory of Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which has lasted for several years, initially due to the strength of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which provides a major aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it expected that the other three owners would also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant belongs to the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Alumina companies, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp owns smaller shares.
"The AGL campaign expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, that is, the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not cease," she stated.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called "hedged contracts," which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL still expects that these contracts will bring their share of income in the 2017 fiscal year," stated the electricity company.
Any potential impact on the profits of AGL from the financial year 2018 is now limited to the projections of a strong future market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in terms of "preliminary avoidance."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to run a metal plant or to supply electricity to a metallurgical plant."
U.S. stated that in 2010, Loy Yang entered into a 20-year contract, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but she still had to explain why she had terminated the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Plant in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle because of the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the Chief of Operations of AGL, Stephen Mikkelsen, said that Portland used about 600 megawatts of energy every year and Tomago was about 900 megawatts each year.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [energy].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it's gonna be bad," he said.
Not just a reality show star, Cardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue number.
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of Cardashian-Jenner's mother-manger Chris clan, appeared on the US magazine Vogue's precipitous cover of September.
Kendall, who was the face of Estee Lauder's brand and defiled on fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her account in Instagram on Thursday.
"In my room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The cover news was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) prepared by reality video, in which the whole family of Cardashian-Jenner (the deboshires Rob and Caitlin, also joined by the world's most beloved uncle of the show business, the producer of the Cardashian Family, Ryan Sicrest, forgot about the sister's appearance on the cover, and at the end, a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard story line of almost all the episodes of children's TV shows dedicated to birthday, but Chris needed to get that fame in one way or another for other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Cardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared with her husband Kanye Westom in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement on its own.
The September issue is the most sold Vogue in the year.
A thickness similar to a gift magazine rather than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (based on the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition contained advertisements).
The news about who the stars are gonna get on his cover is looking forward to the fact that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have been leaking to the official annes.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelical and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly been presented with more "marks that work models" than "models that are celebrities."
The Oskar Prize Laureate and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrence's brand were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gague's honour came out.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "exit model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (though Jenner gets into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, which appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the best in the career in connection with the release of the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past star television reality show, always had to remain fragile.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, calling them "ditches of the moment."
These moods were drilled again after the news about Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to dwell on displeasure.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue number.
She's a supermodel in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their pictures in their own apps that are available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own handmade pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's part of a reality show on television.
Public legal centres are denied services to 160,000 persons per year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected persons are denied service in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an effect that will further cut funding to and so on.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older, immigrant, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight unfair property deprivation and so on - have already been refused to obtain free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the capacity are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Queensland Public Legal Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people had been denied a year.
Farrell said that unless the Federal Government's decision was reversed, the situation would only deteriorate.
"Queensland's public legal centres are constantly receiving inadequate funding, meaning that thousands of people are denied essential services," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and irradiated debts, families who pass through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers - all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected Queensland residents will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland George Brandis to cancel these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the country ' s average.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palashuk Government to engage in this important work.
Donald Trump's election headquarters were sued after a staff member allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to New York, Donald Trump's pre-election headquarters were brought to court: it was alleged that headquarters did not do anything after reporting that his operating director in North Carolina threatened a gun to a staff member when they were driving to a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court action filed on Wednesday before the state court in Charlotte Wincent Bedini, a former software instructor at the state electoral headquarters.
Bedini said he waited a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that "it's not gonna happen."
Director Earl Phillip "saw the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and put the duck on Vincent's knee cup," so Bedini claims in a complaint.
By complaining about the local and regional electoral headquarters office, Boreti realized that at least four more people had become involved in similar incidents with Phillip, allegedly in circulation.
"Pistolettes don't have to shoot to hurt," said Bedini in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place only two days after the Republican party presidential candidate produced a van, telling the North Carolina audience that "People of the Second Amendment" - understood as owners of weapons and their lovers - could act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trump's pre-election headquarters said that the media had removed his words from the context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In its complaint, Borditi seeks compensation from the electoral headquarters for neglect and Phillip for threats of physical violence, assault and moral injury.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks has been slow to respond to a request for comment.
Trying to talk to Phillip failed.
WCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
The presidential candidate for Donald Trump, the Republican Party, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Boredi v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg District High Court Division (Sharlott).
Britain should guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
It will also bring recovery and prosperity, not only in our cities and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
I think it was the great advantage of Heathrow, just like London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we're gonna do this again by creating opportunities for local residents and firms next to Heathrow.
Only for our villages will we create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012, there's gonna be people who think the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would be in a difficult position in the world arena.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow is answerable to any question asked about it.
Like the Heathrow Olympic Games, it's a infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a beautiful team in Hitrow, which introduced 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in time and within the budget, from T5 to the best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world's largest runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 Olympics in London were a huge success for Britain, and I'm sure the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
The time has come for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Histrow, providing our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing "smoking cats" on the issue of blocking advertising.
For companies that earn money on the Internet, attempts to bypass the software to block advertising are a game in "smokers," according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertisements on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their filters in the program to block social media advertising again.
Facebook announced on Tuesday that the hard version of the site changed the rope around its advertising to make it more difficult for advertisers to recognize what parts of the page were advertising.
But Adblock now says he's been able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, Abblock Ben Williams wrote that "this type of mutual struggle between the open source advertising community and those trying to bypass it has continued since the invention of the advertising freeze," and Facebook may be presenting its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network has entered the struggle is a clear indication of how large the problem has been for the industry to block advertising.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to the Pagefair and Adobe study last year; almost four times more than the number of people using the software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who go on Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook advertising income.
However, the company is hunting desktop advertisements because mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, advertising in the desktop version is a fairly profitable article to make Facebook consider such a step a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertised preference" tool to give people more control over how advertising was traded on them.
On Thursday Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were a cause for concern, as they would also block some non-verbal content on the website.
"It will not be a good experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," the Facebook representative stated in an official e-mail.
The advertising blockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools such as advertising preferences to put governance in the hands of people.
The woman moved to the Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on the highway early in the morning of Thursday, in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morge in the canton of Vo immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman was on the road in the dark "in the midst of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, told the police in a statement.
In an obvious attempt to kill herself, a victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, struck several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
A few involved drivers have already been interviewed, but the identity of some has not yet been established, and the police have informed them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case had been initiated, a logical step in that situation, and counsel Gila Hofstetter Le Tribone de Geneve had stated.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a strike?
That's what the prosecutor has to say." Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be found responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the highway - a sentence was handed down that motorists could not expect to meet with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night - the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed the man lying on A1 near Piern last night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard a trial.
The Court found that a female police officer, who responded to an emergency call, was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "a rather exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge stated.
Anyone who owns information about the incident on Thursday near Morge must call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nasov Space Research Institute Goddard developed a model for studying the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether there could be conditions similar to terrestrial conditions on Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere, re-enriched carbon dioxide.
The scientists had previously assumed that Venus's small speed of rotation was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus may have had a broken atmosphere like the Earth, and still has a slow spin.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
There are likely to be more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographical variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent thick.
"GISS models agree, Venus's slow rotation puts her on the day side of the sun for almost two months in one time," explained in a press release by a scientist from GIS Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is the average climate temperature, which, surprisingly, is a few degrees colder than it is today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus similar to that of development, which was previously suggested by planetary researchers.
Although Venus may have been inhabited once, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen blew out, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect - that is, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche Team Coach post.
Patrick Roy left the position of coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the command decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President/Chief Manager of Joe Sakik's radar team confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I've been thinking hard and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey activities must be perfectly consistent with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the team ' s work.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and lost playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
The gateman from the Slava Hall won four Stanley Cups, two from Montreal Canadians and avalanche.
North Sea oils resume negotiations and suspend strike
Work strikes on oil workers ' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parties to the debate have begun a new round of negotiations and have been informed by the leading representatives of the parties.
The strikes against Wood Group's oil service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," the joint statement states.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, beginning next week, to look at the problems with fresh eyes.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential salary cuts up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market tensions.
The decline in the company ' s rates occurred after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space necessary to overcome the market decline.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalized its operations as a result of its mega-clash with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower oil prices: the economic situation deteriorated as a result of the decision to withdraw from the European Union adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
A Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major labour conflicts that emerged in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, was vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, contrasting with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of the stars in a cluster of Plead.
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of Star rotation speeds in the Plead cluster.
New data help astronomers to understand why stars in the cluster rotate with different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation relate to planet formation.
"We hope that, by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," explained in a press release by Louise Riball, a researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre at the California Institute of Technology.
The accumulation of Plead is in 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only mature; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they're never gonna be again.
At their peak speeds, these mature stars throw out large numbers of star winds.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a brake effect on the stars.
As the star grows older, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the emergence of known star spots - such as sun spots.
The latest speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars are moving slower than smaller stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger pieweets are slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet, we see that those who rotate slowly, usually more massive, while those who rotate faster tend to be very light stars," said Riball.
Because Plead's accumulation is so close, it serves as an ideal space lab to compare the properties of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Star Collection of Pleyad provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," said Riball.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars slow down their rotations and hang their dance shoes on the nails, by the way.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleyad's speed in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
The investigation of a group of detainees in Crimea of Ukrainian divers is carried out by two departments and is written by Kommersant ' .
The FBI collects evidence of detainees ' involvement in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, the Ukrainian city of Energodar Eugeni Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave a confession.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armiansk, the Petrobazou in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline, and a military airfield as sabotage sites.
The law enforcement officers believe that not all diversaries have been detained.
This, inter alia, gave rise to the arrest of suspects in Kiev City of Simferople, noting the publication.
The main coach of Russia's football team was Stanislav Churches.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint the Russian football team, Stanislav Churchos, to be the principal coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will be for two years until the CM-2018 has been completed.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Churchesov as the main football coach of Russia.
This is a famous football player who used to play at the Moscow Spartaque position at the gate position, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of Russian teams like the same Spartacus, Gemchuzhina Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dinamo, and the Warsaw Legi, who became the winner of the country ' s national Persians and Cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchess will be signed as soon as possible for two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare a team for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that his trainer headquarters will include Miroslav Romaschenko, Gentaras Staucé, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information according to which the salaries of the entire trainer headquarters would amount to Euro2.6 billion a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation's leadership has set a goal for Stanislav Churches to bring Russia's assembly to the semi-finals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers the creation of a competitive environment on the team as a priority and intends to give football players the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he's glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match, under the leadership of Churchesov, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, earlier, Leonid Slucky was the head coach of the Russian football team, combining him with his training at the CSCA club.
He announced his resignation following the Russian national team ' s final Euro-2016 presentation in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the bad outcome of the team.
In the long struggle against apartheid, Namibia was severely affected by the delay between Angola and South Africa.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous progress, particularly in the past few years.
Namibia ' s main reason for its success was that the Government attached great importance to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as themselves, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce fees for "cost-recovery" training.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of inequality, Namibia is declining.
In comparison with the 1993 figure, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of expression rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Perceptions of Corruption, which is composed of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the US debt level and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least in traditional methods of assessment, remains high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is a higher-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their State is indeed a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in the underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
There are isolated nomadic tribes of hunters living in the deserts, which must be integrated into modern society in one way or another, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: as is the case with any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
Namibia, however, did not think to lay down its hands, but the country was addressing the challenges it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15 to 20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that neighbours did not choose, but therefore chose not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and to exchange students.
Moreover, the Government of Namibia rightly believed that the rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the revenues of Namibia ' s natural wealth must be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country ' s resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that they do so.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so strong government support for freedom of expression is so important.
As the Head of State, Hage Gaingob, has pointed out, the media often say that he doesn't like it.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms obtained, says the President.
Not all key resources in Namibia are exhausted.
Some - such as fishing - are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Each year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia has shown that even those countries that are beginning with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial order, inequality and low levels of development - can be on the road to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and leadership.
Many have heard of the Golden Varna - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4,200 B.C.).
Perhaps it was the largest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, a fantastic quantity of gold artifacts - more than 3,000 in total weight of 6 kg - was found at the excavations of the Varnen Necropolus.
Only one grave known as "Mogilla No. 43" recovered 990 gold items with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold could soon be transformed into a buzine found by the archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tel Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea near the village of Yunacite Pazarjik district.
Busina is a gold strip wrapped into a ring.
Yavor Bojajiev, the head of the dig in Tella Yunacite, dated the 4600th year to C.E. and stated that she was older than Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
Varna's treasure, remember, dates from around the same period, 4,600 to 4,200 B.C.E.
There is currently no technology to date metal with impeccable accuracy.
How can I be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Professor Bojajiev obviously knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm pretty sure that Yunacite's gold is older than Varna's gold."
It's an extremely important finding: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojajiev, scientists will soon analyse metal composition and re- and more thoroughly study archaeological sites where gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with the greatest accuracy possible.
The location also explains a lot.
It's a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Telle Yunacite is now considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
The body was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (now Turkey) in the 7th millennium to C.E.
Over the next centuries, metal processing in the region has grown dramatically, from the development of the first metallurgy skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
Urban settlements began to emerge in the 5 millennium to the C.E. around metal processing centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Yunacite may be the oldest since the artifacts of 4900 B.C. were found here.
I'd call Tel Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, even though it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place older than Schumera for a thousand years," says Bojajiev, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture is emerging in the south of Mesopotamia, today's Iraq.
The first cities came up there in the usual sense of that word.
The excavations of Telle Yunacite have been under way since 1976.
During that time, the archaeologists dug up nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Residues of the fortress wall, which once reached three metres high, were found.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but the archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, business centre and residential margins.
Junacitte's body is often called "The City of Bird," and dozens of clay bird figures were found here.
All birds are represented in peace, suggesting that they were not decorative objects but the object of a local cult.
The "Friend City" was destroyed about 4,100 years before the C.E. - possibly by the Indo-European tribes from the north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-metre fortress walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have found clear signs of a brutal slaughter: remains of old men, women and children have been found inside the homes, with signs of wounds sustained by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts are emerging every year, changing the traditional perceptions of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about separate cultures, but about the "lossed" of the first civilization of Europe that originated in the Balkans.
Warna's gold, found relatively recently in 1972, was a powerful incentive in the search for this civilization.
It's logical that Varna's gold luxury should have been preceded by something like a tiny gold bead created in Tella Yunacita.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially old.
It is officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is prepared manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
"Retro-Luc" is, for example, in the special colour of the body Etna Blue, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model has been painted in this color.
In addition, the Targa received a firm white graph alongboards and special 20-inch wheel discs RS Spyder, as well as some parts of the shape of the body painted in the white gold metal.
In the interior, the retro worms are significantly smaller: it is largely different from the gray gamma, new seats with extended electric adjustment ranges and separated black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car cheque and a rich album with photographs of the production process.
The power plant of the Porsche Exclusive Throw is not: the retro-targa is quite the same as the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder motor with a turbocharged capacity of 3.0 litres, developing 420 l.s. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Portsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with limited circulation, but neither the volume nor the value of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and advertising blocked the "arm race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented social media advertising, provoked decision makers to block advertising for response.
AdBlock Plus released the antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus promoted its new technology, which is likely to be effective for a short time.
Representatives of the social media noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unlocked" advertising, the decision of AdBlock Plus, together with commercial announcements, blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they deplored the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the source among social media developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's web site will be ready within the next hour.
Thus, socialists and blockers have unleashed a kind of "arm race," trying to beat each other, and the injured party has become users who have missed interesting records from friends or have seen advertisements where they have not been used to see it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have recently been a source of hot debate.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought before the trial of the Night Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murman region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: sexual violence.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk had committed sexual acts involving violence against a 20-year-old girl; the criminal case with an approved indictment was sent for consideration on the merits.
The content of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring Crossvan Fengguang 370 to Russia and the Rich New pickup, a website for driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular representative in China of a class of cars that combines the dignity of the minivan and the crossover.
Another declared Russian premiere is Rich New's pickup.
Many Western firms in Moscow's international convoy this year have decided to ignore, so the empty exhibition halls of the Chrocus Expo will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large species on the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting novelties to our car lovers in the near future, will be a powerful front.
One of them will be Crossvan Dongfeng Fengguang 370 sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand roubles at current rates).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a centrifuge light, and the issue of the supply to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach the 11th place on the list of the most sold minivans, although because of the high road clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it is quite possible to add it to the crossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-line platform of the Young Fengguang 360 model, with the 370th same wheel base of 2,725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4,565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is stronger and the equipment is richer.
The salon was painted with wooden designs, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early crossvan exhibition, and the machines with the music were sold easier.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily assembled, forming a level loading site of 1,650 mm long, with a maximum volume of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine consists of only one-1.5-litre petrol "atmososic" power of 115 l.s, which is connected to a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The dynamic quality of the machine is modest, but promises a heavy budget of 6.7 l/100 km for the owner of the appetite.
Picup Rich New is a well-known Russians of Nissan NP300 Navara in the past generation, but with a slightly appreciated Chinese style design.
Despite a morally outdated design, this model still uses a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unsustained "working horse."
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested in Russian, because modern Japanese pickups have become extremely expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 l.s) or turbodylene 2.5 l (116 l.s).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, a drive to the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigid front.
It's gonna be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagman sedan A9, his Russian Prime Minister's office announced the Chinese firm as early as June.
The Chinese market has grown more and more, some of the last new ones - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian lens Dongfeng consists of two models: Sedane S30 and H30 Cross.
In the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese firm made 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will stop sending by mail, the < www.zr.ru > website
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian automobile owners have been accustomed to a different pattern of years: in the summer and autumn, they receive a receipt for the transportation tax of the previous year.
However, many of them will not be expected this year.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without any noise.
Those who are registered in the Tax Payer's "List Office" on the official website of the Nalog.ru department will be notified electronically.
In the inspection, the Russians were automatically regarded as online users and cut them off from a standard, paper-based distribution.
The novelty will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All the others will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, it is possible to get back to the old scheme with the record holders on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office and write a statement during August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" immediately after writing, while the letter will take several days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service was transferred to 18 million people, which would allow the agency to save heavily on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed procedure.
Some may have registered with the "personal office" for one-time service and have long forgotten it.
These people will not be able to receive mail notices, nor will they themselves fall into the non-payment category with all the consequences.
Access to the tax collector's "Listroom" is done in three ways: through the record of the Gosuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or by the introduction of the logic and password specified in the registration map.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax inspection office (regardless of the place of incorporation).
We recall that this year ' s transport tax should be paid until 1 December.
The notification was sent in July.
Prison Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve a very high impact, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse G-Power's masters, who took over the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63 sports conversions.
G-Poyer is known for his addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is alien.

By pumping the "muscules" of the crazy "gelica," the master took advantage of the benefits offered by the 5.5-litre G-8 blower.
Now, the dynamics of the run down to hundreds have improved to the indifferent 0.1 s, and now the flying bricks are capable of a 5.3 s leap.
However, accelerations from the mid speed must be much better for him.
The speed ceiling is scary: if standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h, a tunnel alley with a deactivated electronic "shelter" can squeeze 250 km/h.
Outside, the vehicle is almost non-divided from its factory source, except for other wheel discs - 23-inch Herricane RR size 305.35 ZR 23.
