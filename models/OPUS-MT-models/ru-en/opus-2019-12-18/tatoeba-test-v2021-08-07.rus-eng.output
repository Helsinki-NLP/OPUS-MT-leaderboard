White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black peach on h4-mat, in chess circles, it's a joke called a stupid mat.
White: sweets on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8 Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites put rivals in the position of Tuzgzwang, putting their hands on a6, followed by only two options for blacks: take a6 or move the elephant to any other field of diagonali b8-h2. In the first case, whites move a paw with b6 to b7 and set a mat. In the second case, the white owner picks a black foot by a7 with the same result.
