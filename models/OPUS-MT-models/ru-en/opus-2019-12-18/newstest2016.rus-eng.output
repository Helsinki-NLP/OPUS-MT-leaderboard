The social map of the resident of Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes include the maintenance of a public passenger transport benefit.
Since 24 September, preferential travel arrangements for citizens have been changed using the social map of the resident of Ivanov province.
According to the press service, the Government of the Russian Federation for the Ivan region provides for the continuation of the travel privileges in public passenger transport and brings the social map netting scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ "On the National Payments System."
However, the social map of the resident of Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
For example, the replenishment limit is now set not on travel, but on cash, with winter and summer periods remaining at least 400 roubles in winter, and not more than 800 roubles in summer for the current month.
Social card holders will now need to monitor the balance of the travel balance rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier ' s rate.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social cash map remains the same, from 24 of the previous month to 23 of the current month.
The new social map travel arrangements will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed record of money spending on the social map accurate to the spears.
In addition, there is the possibility of refunding credits but unutilized funds.
Add also that the scheme of discounts with carriers becomes transparent, as half of the cost of travel is now paid by the citizen, and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when cash is placed on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivan region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million social map trips were carried out in the region, almost 25 million in 2015.
More than 470 million rubles are provided in the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel to citizens using the social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to killing a friend.
During a 911 call, almost without a dungeon, a teacher from Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that they needed staff to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that there's a dog in the house that's alive, but probably upset, and said that the contact of the family of the deceased could be found on her phone.
In the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that wasn't well written in hand on a white sheet of lint paper: "I'm sorry, I'd like to get it all back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where the police believed he had shot all the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police, Delta State University, Lynn Baford, reported that university officials had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true call at 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the victim's day, it's gonna be one more thing: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities were still trying to lay down a picture of the motives behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators in both parts of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students told me they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gotya, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation for the beautiful people with whom he had crossed his teaching life.
Both were taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 about how he was struggling with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in the university rules for admission to employment meant that the doctor ' s degree to which Lamb worked so hard would not guarantee him automatic access to a teacher ' s post.
President William Laforge of the University reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "I see Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself from a 38-caliber platoon gun in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the coroner of Washington Metro Johnson County.
His car with the engine still stood on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began to work at a university of 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009, and taught geography and teaching.
He received a Ph.D. in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's long-standing friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hayrston told me she was 15 years old, and Lambu was 20 years old when they met through shared friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a cool older guy who's been trying to teach her how to play guitar for years.
In those years, he was successful in women.
All the girls were hiding when he was around," said Hayrston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, the suburbs of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss, at the time of the events, must have met for some time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gothya in a brick house whose back side is coming to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," told O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't date Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and co-location, the entertainment program coordinator at The Julep Room in Gotier's suburbs, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lipstick for a few visitors.
There's nothing suspicious about it.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and scouting each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Empori and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the candle light memorial ceremony.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
They'll be back on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today's the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that Lamb's call came into service 911 after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb was talking about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season.
Toys R Us says that it won't hire as many staff for the holiday season as it was last year, while the realist of toys and goods for children assures us that it will allow staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reports that it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would start interviewing the applicants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although until the holidays a few months later, the purchase season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough stock in stores and sales, shipping and delivery.
Michael J. Fox is joking about "date" with Princess Diana.
The film's premiere "Return to the Future" was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also notable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a movie theater waiting for royal family members to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and I was caught sitting next to me by Princess Diane," he told me in the trailer about the movie, "The Back of Time" on the screen.
The film begins, and I think I'm literally at a length of my hand and one fake name from a date with Princess Wales.
Back in time, a documentary on the film Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemex and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film premiered 30 years ago on Back to the Future.
"For me, " says Spielberg, "is undoubtedly the greatest movie of time travel ever taken."
Back in time will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The Head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, that there is no "military solution" for almost five years of conflict, and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations again called upon all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had "dissolved the situation."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump isn't kidding.
Some tried to put a wire on him.
Others took it off when they took it as a joke.
Some people want a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to defame Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they failed (by the time).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for the real estate magnet in terms of the chances of obtaining a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has the chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
The experts point out that, at that time, in 2011, Rick Perry gave his preliminary popular character to Herman Kane, none of whom won and one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Super Committee of Political Activity" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "The Growth Club" recognize Trump's undesired power and begin to get their dollars to rip it off.
Here are some of the data from the interviews that indicate that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
Ratings of sympathy for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans were positive about this real estate magnet.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
This was 52 per cent in early August.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators will prevail in the early stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of Republicans were tied to Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would have set up Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said that they had either been "appreciated" or "satisfied" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "bracing" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would have been "wonderful" against 40 per cent of those who speak the same thing about Trump).
The next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21%.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republicans say they'll be "unsettled" or "restructed" if Jeb Bush's fan of the story becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 per cent of Republican voters across the country think that the magnet has a suitable temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington post survey on Monday showed.
The same figure appears in the country's first closed meeting in Iowa State, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think he has the same person who might be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective in office, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperation is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they wear their badge hats, Republican voters think that Trump is serious.
On the question of who the most likely winner in GOP's nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favourite, according to CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 put on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be credible.
Even if Republicans were to come together around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some platoons point out that such dispersion is likely to be the advantage of Trump, while not supporting Trump are evenly distributed among the supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition "one by one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He's ahead of Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Casic and Chris Christy at 33 points.
He has no one with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who walks around him?
Ben Carson chased a businessman into 19 points at a hypothetical "one-to-one" competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they changed their mind.
The new CBS/NYT survey, held on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they're confident in their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition is now with a colleague-outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapid" two months ago in his campaign speech, immigration has become the most relevant issue in the conversation in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's performance will divert key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent the re-branding.
But according to the ABC/Post survey on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government is gaining new momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now rely on support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
One of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll claims that they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended at Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent "unsettled" and 21 per cent "in rage."
The Government will decide on the fate of pension indexations in October.
The Vice-Premier of the Russian Federation, Olga Goldetz, stated that the Government was now looking for options for implementing the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 for real inflation, was transferring to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, at the time of the next year ' s submission of the draft budget to the Government.
In addition, the cabmin is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the capital pension of Russians.
The head noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion roubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for the following year is approximately the same.
According to the Vice-Premier, there is no final solution to the question of who should pay for non-working citizens.
If a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially unprotected categories of citizens, the fact that he is paid by society is not entirely fair.
Previously, the media reported that the cabmine was considering two options for balancing the State budget.
Why is it often annoying and blushing for centuries?
Answered by Tatiana Levashov, a doctor-oftalmologist:
Our ages are latitudes that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that sit on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of blfarite ourselves.
The exit is simple:
Don't touch your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet napkin for the century;
at least 1-2 times a day, clear the edges of the century from the harmful substances they have accumulated during the day.
Clarifying procedures are not too much to supplement the warm compresses of therapeutic herbs (shalphea, rums) that fuel the thick secret of salt irons and then the massage of the edges of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of finger cushions;
And when you're making makeup, don't use alcohol.
They bite and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the further melting of the secret of the salt irons.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear-powered nuclear warheads have been created.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonben, was "in full power."
This was reported on the country ' s Central Television Agency ' s website.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the US" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality."
The last nuclear test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, writing political.ru.
Girinsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian gymnasium.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the union of brotherly peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said that during the meeting of the State Duma, he reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"Very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes don't survive," said Zhirinsky.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the four-hundredths containing this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem needed to be changed to "God, King, Keep," and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag wrote political.ru.
Asad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Al-Assad of Syria called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Asad is confident that if Europe wants to cope with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans care about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee question," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they cannot be possible as long as people die until the bloodshed continues and people feel secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we win terrorism in Syria," said Asad.
We recall that some 500,000 migrants, including Syrian migrants, have arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world had been the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of militants of the Islamic State extremist group may be among migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of the German city have organized a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become the host of refugees, although recently it has strengthened border control to keep them from falling.
According to the authorities, some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call large numbers.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
B-B-Si Jenny Hill's correspondent visited Darmstadt, where migrants received a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin debuts the Prime Minister at the session
After the election of Mr. Corbin, the Prime Minister is looking forward to his debut at the session.
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak for the first time at the session of the Prime Minister, for the first time fighting with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of the six questions raised in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for less theater and more facts in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin ' s first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the Tread Union Annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour Leaders to stand silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of Bitwa for Britain, led to criticism by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to sing the State Anthem drew attention
Mr. Corbin's press secretary stated that he "stayed in silence" and acknowledged "the heroicism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow cabinet, informed Newsnight on BBC 2, that he would advise the Labour leader to sing a national anthem "independently" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin's team, raising differences on economic, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The Political Correspondent, BBC Robin Brant, said that political differences would also be "stopped" in the Labour Party following the appointment of Mr. Corbin as a member of the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Union Conference that the Labour Party had amended the idea of limitations as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions stated that the party had "full clarity" that it had been in opposition only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party, with whom David Cameron will meet at the courier box in the last 10 years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Leaders, who had promised a different approach to politics, said that he had "brought collective resources" to seek Mr. Cameron's ideas and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of Parliament from Ailington North stated that the Prime Minister ' s questions raised excessive confrontation, and that he would refrain from the sharp answers and the exchange of rings, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the shadow cabinet, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also suggested allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercoa, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of the "warming basalan" often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but acknowledged several years later that he had failed to do so.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s questions have become a key indicator of the leadership ' s views, their ability to manage the Assembly Hall and reputations of other members of Parliament, although critics have claimed that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Stayed in Johannesburg," homeless young people trained in photographers
The Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for the homeless.
But one group of former street children found a way to learn the craft and earn a living.
"I was taken in Johannesburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhoods and make a living on it.

Pound sterling is growing as wages grow in Britain
The pound grew up in the face of rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of the offer to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, earnings in Britain, minus bonus, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009, and it has been seen as a postponement of projections for possible increases in boilers.
Pound sterling grew by more than 1 per cent in relation to the dollar, amounting to $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro, making up Y1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6,229.21 per 1.49%.
Overall, SABMiller's shares increased by 20 per cent due to the offer to buy from AB InBev's competition.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest beer companies, bringing up brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grollsch.
Burberry's shares grew at 0.9 per cent, with encouraging news from the competing group of producers of the Richemon Lux.
Recent sales data for Richemon exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - the key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
The Glencore stock grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant announced that he had managed to obtain $2.5 billion through equity, which had been done as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group shares were the leader of the 4.3% drop in the index, after Goldman Sachs reduced the band's rating to "sell".
The JD Sports stock grew after a sports clothing supplier reported a 83 per cent increase in profits up to six months ' taxation to 46.6 million pounds.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion.
The Executive Director, JD Sports Peter Caugill, said that raising the minimum wage for British workers meant "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
The costs could affect the plans to expand JD Sports, adding, which could mean a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a bottom-up campaign to fight the Niti Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA players in South Australia and West Australia, in the light of the upcoming investment by Aldi 700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale stores and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote IGA branding through marketing in leading media and social media networks and activities such as Adelaide Show.
The campaign has been joined by Rhythlers and IGA suppliers, such as the ice cream producer Simmo's from Dunsboro, who offers a degust at IGA stores, and shopkeepers, who sell tickets to permanent customers for the games of the South Australian League football League.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - the day that this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will spend its annual investor strategy day.
There is much to be done because in South Australia and West Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known to be committed to routine routes, so the market is more beneficial to IGA rhythmiers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will market 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of his first shops, taking the sales volume from all the players present, but mainly from independent rhythmiers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA's real estate players may lose 360 million dollars per year and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores next year in SA and 30 in WA, selling $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenues and sales of food at a high level of constant costs, Metcash, may cost the company about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, considers Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is believed that the sale of Metcash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company ' s market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noticed at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "can be more likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market declined from 18 per cent to 14 per cent from 2010, while Metcash ' s income from food-related businesses, which the company provides to some 1,200 IGA rhythmiers, fell by 43 per cent from 2012 due to the operational process and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equal retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths on thousands of items weekly and to assist IGA operators in re-engineering trading sites, and to offer a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of branded foods.
Director General Metsash Ian Morris says price levelling and re-engineering of trade areas is on track, and hopes that the company will achieve an increase in net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Healy.
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirjos, and for his conduct deserves more honor than criticism, as President Tennis Australia says Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented duet, often called "Special Ks," seemed to be at the centre of attention because of Kirius' shameless slapping with Stan Wahrinka on the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualification match in Cincinnati, the judge at the tower had to do twice with Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Vawrinca had to put Kiryos on his shovel, and I had to put that guy on my shovel."
Since Kokkinakis last saw a scraping racket after the shiproach in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat on US Open, Healy faithfully protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second after Bernard Tomić in solitary confinement in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup v. Great Britain.
"I'm really worried about one thing, that Tanashi was involved in the conflict," said Healy.
He really broke a rocket when he had his foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break a rocket when hopes broke, and I know Tanasi is good enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he owned himself very well in rather provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's a little unfair.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he fits the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensely training, he's in great shape, he's a very determined and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
He also supported the decision to forgive Kirjos for an important match starting Friday, thinking of "one-way consent" as the right way for everyone, but counting on the guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the disputes around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, which proves that people like Federer and Marray are growing up in front of the public, he's made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center for some time so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
In declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those attempting to enter the country illegally in order to contain the influx of migrants inside.
There had been unrest on the border, with hundreds of migrants digging into the border, which had been severely affected by the Serbian authorities.
Having been trapped indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke tents and settled in the area.
However, there has been an increase in frustration.
When a police helicopter ran over them, the migrants screamed "Open the border!" and yelled insults against the Hungarian special-purpose police.
Some rejected food and water as a protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants from Hungary when more and more of them came from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of a solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
Waves on the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a 28-country block was unable to formulate a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that a further 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary, would be agreed upon in the coming month or the end of the year.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded that the European Union ' s emergency summit be convened next week to discuss the continent ' s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to prompt action on the part of Brussels or its neighbours.
The Tuesday emergency in the two southern regions gave more authority to the authorities to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, said that his country was also planning to take a barbed wire from the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dogmat reported that even prisoners had been involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main "narrow" and the border crossing point of the European Union for the displaced, many of whom are refugees who are victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugees who are victims of war that are entitled to protection, and this view is very different from that of other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight now criminalize the crossing or damage of a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison terms for the accused of trafficking in persons.
"In view of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declared a state of emergency," the journalists were told by the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament is still required to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters Associated Press, who are on the border, have been watching the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Dird Bacondi, Orban National Security Adviser, reported that 45 persons had been caught by authorized authorities attempting to cross the border at the very border and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings at the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, by sending a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passageways.
The disturbances broke out on the main passage across the border near the town of Rjösk (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed a service space to pass people inside the metal container, and the crowd pressured each other to break in.
Some 20 individuals were able to enter, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would be denied food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: The advantage of Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to retain a two-digit advantage in the race of Democrats for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders goes second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives support from 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the initial election competition began, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have identified the candidate to be supported.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonus.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has diminished.
Her support for men fell significantly, and Sanders lags behind her by only five points.
Clinton's preference for democratic voters for up to 50 years has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton chased Sanders to a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters across the country say that they would be enthusiasticly supportive of Clinton if she were to be a candidate for the party.
A fourth would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It may not be surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters speak the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters ask an open question why they want to see her, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that now is the time of the female president (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called an agreement on questions and chances of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third thinks that he should not.
When they are asked who they want to see in second place among the party candidates, the primary Democrats in most cases call Beiden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that they'd choose Baiden second, more than Sanders.
If Baiden chooses not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points to 30 points without Baiden.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
By this indicator, Baiden has a high backlog in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to a question about what is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the possibility of being elected.
Similarly, last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Candidates from Democrats, or potential candidates, have shown a good result in some key features among the primary voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and credible people with good leadership qualities.
Biden, of all three, leads in honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on it.
The original democratic voters also generally consider the same ideological views as Clinton, Sanders and Baidoa.
For all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While the questions about Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail box and server are still being raised by her Secretary-General, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general opinion on it.
But it's a very different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
This was shared by the public as early as March, soon after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail debate has had no effect on their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion has deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton believes that it is fair and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good leadership marks.
Of the six protesters, Baiden, Carson and Bush show the best result of honesty.
Most see an honest man in Sanders rather than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The threshold for errors in the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in close proximity.
Ben Carson reached Donald Trump in the last CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates obtained half of the voters' votes in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of footholds
Republican voters throughout the country continue to provide massive support to Trump, whose support increased from 23 per cent in a recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in a Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all population groups, embarrassing Trump in a group of voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasić, went back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakaby and Senator Florida Marco Rubio, together, ranked third with 6%.
The threshold for sampling errors of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6 per cent, and the survey was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson's growth in the polls - showing support for 19 per cent of Republicans - for Trump with 32 per cent of support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Trump was far ahead of Carson.
Because of the increase in Carson's support last week, Trump made several critical attacks on a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student during the dedication ritual in the Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"Pi Delta Psi's brothers from New York College Baruch brutally attacked Chan "Mikela" Denga during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital in time, which led to his death," reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with a sand behind his back was pushed several times while he tried to reach the target by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
P. Delta Psi's brothers didn't call 911, when Deng lost consciousness, and they expected an hour before they took him to the hospital, they told the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Mengo, the national president of the fraternity, to ask advice, as Chief Chris Wagner said at the press conference.
"At this point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt head, torso and thigh injuries.
"There were too many families affected by the rituals of dedication to brotherhood, since at least one student died every year, beginning in 1970," said Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Dang family.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jury in Monroe County has been inclined to support a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against a newer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that authorized all of this formally or informally, then it is also her," Wagner stated at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national brotherhood excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There's gonna be a raise in rates, and the bull market will trip, bond returns will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna go before the offensive, and how long it's gonna last.
Specifically for the economy, history doesn't explain much about time.
The recession came only 11 months after the first raise and 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The US Central Bank Administration therefore insists that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
Actually, there's a lot of variables in the game.
At the end of the day, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around rising rates is exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve's rates, with the onset of the global financial crisis, will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of cheap money, " reported Julian Jessop, the chief international economic expert in Capital Economics, in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of interest rates in the US to a more normal but still low levels to be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Consider how some areas of the economy could respond according to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, the expectation of higher rates can lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate rises, however, the consequences are not usually so dramatic.
"It's not like the stock revenues were delayed 12-24 months after the first download, which, again, probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate increases.
More specifically, the market has more rapidly changed over the past approximately 35 years - about 14 per cent - to raise rates, remains relatively flat for 250 days (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal average income of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, the main trade strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities is not immediately more pronounced at the rate-up stage, and equity revenues are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but higher rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that were not previously in existence and may speed up the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the lifetime of the high rate.
Deutsche Bank states that in 118 cases, rising rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will take long, with only 1.5 per cent of it in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
Higher rates on such a volatile economic background may be risky and question "will be different" has been reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the Federal Reserve system rates all year, with their views tied to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends on Thursday.
While many policy specialists and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase in rates at this meeting, future trade is only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the rate rise cycles to date have been in the supercycle of a growing financial lever with GDP that overlaps the peaks leading up to the recession very quickly after the recovery begins," the report states.
By contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is now the longest, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, which has lasted 74 months and has not yet ended.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects to raise rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being implemented for shares.
The policy difference is that bonds will have a faster effect than shares when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that returns change vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate raise cycle, bond returns immediately fall," reports Deutsche.
Policy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring long-term and short-term bond returns closer to a flater curve.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in returns," says Katie Jones' study, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System policy.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has been adjusted to a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, with more flat returns, more credit breaks, volatility has increased - all market characteristics with stronger federal policies.
Generally speaking, the companies leading their business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"The story shows that "quality" stocks are more effective than market performance within three months of the initial raise of rates," the analysts of Goldman Sachs said in the client report.
Firms with stable financial conditions have become unstable as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-voltility stocks, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (per cent) and 3 (per cent) respectively.
It's gonna be a big question.
High-interest companies with a floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange deals, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
The contributors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ in how fast this will occur.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," states MP from Conservatives Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament from Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticized the "degradation of standards" station.
Proves that she's becoming more and less different from a commercial rival.
Also targeted at BBC Music Awards, saying that the Brits Award was just a match.
Damien Collins' Parliament Collins, which struck The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said the leader of Parliament, encouraging a teleradio company to prove that she's doing anything that commercial companies don't do.
A member of Parliament from the Conservatives Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leadership that it seemed that the public radio station was "smart" and was becoming less distinct from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems like I don't like using the word "exclusive" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else, here are two examples that came first to me in the minds in which you actually copy what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was going far ahead of its commercial rival when it concerned live music and audience education.
What I know thanks to Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his loyalty to live performances and music is not really equal to anyone else.
"It's really important, I think, Radio 3's interest in finding new music and advancing new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract an audience than in the past, because British people were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child who had been attacked for attacking five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed in the absence of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, involving Palma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "BBC typical style."
He added that he wanted to have that hit in her own home stable next time she started the entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the new seasons of The Voice from being ordered in the future or the use of money for other entertainment formats for those who pay the licence fee.
The growth of Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and the blame could be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase of 7 per cent in online sales
Last month, there has been the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago using mobile shopping devices
The experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help contain the waste.
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been a boom, turning many central streets into ghost cities in Britain.
But experts say there are now signs of a levelling of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The total costs of online shopping in August have shown minimal growth since they began recording in 2000, increasing by only 5 per cent.
Experts say there are now signs that online sales are being levelled after recent data have shown only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," told Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under all conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming up on the platoon, and you can see the decline.
The Black Friday Phenomenon, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers, five times more medium-sized, rushed to computers to make use of beneficial offers, thus affecting a number of vendor websites.
The experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers fight for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over Pound1 out of every five is spent online.
With regard to products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold via Internet magasmines.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more hunting than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims bury the dead when a crane falls in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family is sanctioned.
The Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially charged the car accident to the Saudi Binladin Group building giant
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the crash of the crane
Hundreds of Muslims all over the street fled to bury 29 of the victims killed as a result of the crash of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Those dressed mostly in white, who were present at the funeral filled the carriageway in order to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by a sacred place where only a few days earlier, the construction crane broke the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the King of Saudites fined the construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishes killed in the crash of the crane in the main mosque were on the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, the Grand Manchester, who was on his first pilgrim trip when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hadj in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow a crane raised in a non-working crane.
The Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group bears partial responsibility for the destruction.
The English news agency ' s editorial did not mention this detail, but reported that the company ' s leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane fell into the court of the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered to go to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crash of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate coordination with the meteorological service.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
Ben Laden ' s family has been among Saudi Arabia ' s closest ruling family for decades and is leading the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a modified son who was rejected by the family in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rains just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimhood, which is compulsory at least once in life for every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials have decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased and the same amount has been irreversibly maimed.
The remaining victims will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European workshops working for small money.
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher shuts down 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief Urban Correspondent Daily Mail
The British are said to have laid aside the hammers and the paints, and instead hire qualified Easterners to do work in the house.
If you know how to treat a hammer or how to paint walls, it seems like you're in a minority these days.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are all hired by masters to perform a simple housework.
Veronica Laurie, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns a network of house-building services, reported that the trend was followed by a substantial influx of skilled technicians from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in workshop goods while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q shop staff because eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by women of a weak sex.
Currently, most staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends in the number of single-women households who were more engaged in housing development than in the past could be overlooked.
Ms. Laurie said, "We still have men working mostly in our shops.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women in charge of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team to include equal numbers of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director-General and the Financial Director.
Ms. Laurie said, "This was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women on the board of directors.
After the group took over shop closure costs, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Decision time at US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank in which the decision of the most important decision is discussed within two days - to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still be damaged and maintained at the current range of 0-025 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered its rate to zero.
For the first time, we agree that the main bank can move from zero to a process of normalization of interest rates," announced Angel Ubid, the lead member of the International Economy Institute, Peterson.
The US economy works effectively, economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the solution will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but everyone said that they were confident that all the chances against such a step would be.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
Open up, hundreds of refugees are scanned at the Khorgos checkpoint at the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has crossed the border for the displaced.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to feel other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, is in Austria.
According to some reports, buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to Shida town on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanović, assures him that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but that its capacity is limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to treat them humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It's not easy to decide, no country in Europe can handle it alone, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is unsettled:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the documents necessary for that purpose.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country because he's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already established a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop on this: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis has been part of the law-affiliated governments for several years, which, according to the left, led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he is challenging Cypras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Europeans.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Europeans!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for inviting me.
Nine months ago, your party was defeated by the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, "New Democracy" is being compared to it in popularity.
What changed in this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cypras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a fiscal surplus and growth prospects.
The country now has again a fiscal deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr. Zepras drove them away.
In the last nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country had been in January and the false promises made by Mr. Cypras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised to what actually happened.
Today's life has become much worse than January, when the situation has improved, with most Greek citizens.
But you're saying that if you win the election, you're going to work for alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Wangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have met together to implement the programme by which they have agreed without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Zipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new premier on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Wangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece's movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that a country's withdrawal from the EU would have had.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Unker package and banking sector assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there hadn't been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Cypras negotiating.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to bring order during the first year, it is rational and it is clear that the country has strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Cypras Government has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have learned by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can cite an example of farmers ' incomes.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Cypras never talked about it.
I mean, Greek ministers were not trained and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Ms. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras said to them?
Wangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that before the end of 2014 we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by bypassing its sharp corners.
We have moved forward with reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at that time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which then constituted the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as the mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronughes: Recent weeks have seen a massive influx of refugees throughout Greece.
What do you think of this situation, and the reaction of European countries to which these people aspire?
Wangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election wins.
And the reason is that the SIRIZA Government did not act in this situation as it should have.
In such matters, only emergency measures should be taken to advance, because if the problem comes to you, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in this situation now.
Even the interim government that changed SIRIZ did more in only seven days than Mr. Zepras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim Government, which are of valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for a EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some of the extraordinary events that took place with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will adhere to the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peace town of Drojkovka Donetsk region, during the day, criminal investigation officers of the General Directorate of Police of the Region, together with military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who had been found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Kriwa Rog (Dnepropetrovska region), who had shot a rifle at his opponent in the evening during the joint use of alcohol, and a conflict in the village of Verhenetoreck Yasinovat district of Donetchina.
A 22-year-old boy was reported to have been injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds.
As Artem Vasitski said, the Deputy Director of Criminal Investigation of the Milice District Head, during the course of the operations, the law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the figure in another serious criminal offence - the killing of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident on the same day, causing a man to be shot in the head.
Criminal proceedings have been opened by the Department of Investigation of the Drujkov State under the articles "Intentional homicide" and "Intentional grievous bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
Detainees face up to 15 years ' imprisonment.
Figurant was detained and detained in a temporary detention facility, and reported to the Donetsk region ' s press service.
Two inhabitants of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in Ukrainian flag colour, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
The residents of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicts were restricted to 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found four townsmen guilty of vandalism against Lenin monuments, which were located in the territory of the RCF convoy and on the street of Trikotajna, as well as the Mounement Slava memorial complex.
In the latter case, Katyusha rocket and T-34 tanks were painted.
Remember, on the night of December 12th, in the Russian Novosibirsk, unknowns painted in Ukrainian flag colour military equipment on the Montument of Slava.
The civilian wife of the popular Russian actor Eugenia Tzyganov Irina Leónov gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl appeared in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mom feel good.
Remember, recently the Gygans and Leonov broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina accuses her husband and his ambition.
Eugenia Gyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor in the Moscow Theatre of the Master Peter Fomenko.
He's known for the films "The Walk," "Space as a predator," "Brest fortress," "Ottepel" and "Farza" series.
On 8 September, Eugene Tsyganov was recognized as "Acter of the Year" and "Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who fired at Delta State University left a note of apology.
After shooting and killing his friend at Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "compressing" about the first murder and would like to return everything back, the authorized authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in Gotier, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also said there was a dog in the house that "no one's gonna hurt," but probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Amy Prentiss's body, 41 years old, and a note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to bring it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb travelled 300 miles to Delta State University, where Ethan Schmidt was killed by a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by police, killed himself.
The Rector of the University, William Laforge, reported that he had no knowledge of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamba clearly had something in mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb envisaged an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday "no information or evidence" of the "love triangle."
Oh, Prentiss said he was a good man, Sean O'Stin, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss have a daughter who is 19, and that she's "satisfied."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, which San Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home on the Internet.
Nouls told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she was dating Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to say he wouldn't go to prison.
Last night, when the police caught him on the "1" road near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran to the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in spring 2015, Lamb received a Ph.D. in the field of teaching at the University of Delta.
Stars that lost their luck
Acter (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term life mate, Farru Fosett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from drug dependence and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played its part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champion League game in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While counsel is concerned about this, which will not allow him to go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless subpoena on the 15th minute that 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penal zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or day later and then operate.
It's awful that a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties and play fantasticly, and that's what happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and a guy can't play a group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card or a penalty.
Arbiter Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad ride from two legs.
In my Twitter show, he says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how I'm devastated, my path to recovery begins, I'll come back even stronger than I was."
Also on the theme: Manchester United is in distress with Luke Shaw when he's in the PSV game.
The English Advocate will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, a PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious trauma."
When any player survives this trauma, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno suffered a fracture when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gale at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him now, because he had no intention of hurting an enemy, and when you hear it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," said Kok.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he touched him, but I didn't see a pod under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorox?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: if your kid likes a book, it'll take a little while before you know her almost at once.
I guess unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from the representative of the company organizing children ' s holiday in the vacation about his favorite child book, the Prime Minister chose Lorox, a story with an environmental bias written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on SuperCamps' website, and continues: "It's a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love reading to my children because it always reveals some kind of image or message we're missing."
And everything would be good, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of a single film made in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"A boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart - the girls of her dreams - to see the real tree," we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Suze (the real name of Theodore Suze Gazel) who died in 1991.
If it doesn't look suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost as a short story of the "Lorax" film posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of Alluville, where all the artificial and even air was sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart is the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being a generally active parent, is such a stranger to the contents of a book in which the unnamed boy learns about how to destroy the environment by the greedy tree cutter and the "overwive" Nadokkins, despite the protests by Loraks (whose name is given in the title of the book), a funny creature with a mustache that "spoke on behalf of trees."
It is likely that such a complex PR assignment was entrusted to the perpetrator, who never read to the child a book about Lauras 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron headquarters, but that no further comments had been received.
For Adam Lita, there was clearly a risk not to get into England's team, but it's still a difficult question.
Victory of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England has selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series that happened last time, I don't think it's possible.
I wouldn't have ruled out a victory on my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players in the beating that virtually take the cool balls and collective thinking strong; they won't bring the scars out of 2012, but only a young man's positive.
With Moin Ali's ball, it's turned into a bowler giving cool balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown test-level figure, is an attack option.
Also on the subject: Adam Lit left England's test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Heils.
The decision to exclude Adam Lita to me, his chief coach in Yorkshire, is certainly difficult to analyse.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious, but brutal reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I said it earlier) the players are the best to choose themselves.
A couple of semi-seats, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The main coach of England's team, Trevor Bailiss, spoke well about his design, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and it doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first and then everything else.
The question is how long it's gonna take before the Batsman test cricket leaves an impression - a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his and someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Prime League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is showing up, and he's a Batsman that I appreciate highly.
He's an unpredictable cricketist we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but that would of course depend on the composition of the team in the AAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening Batsman would allow for an extra spinner to be introduced, saving four speed boulers, thinking about it, and I'm not against it.
I don't see why a beating player can't hit the ball there, and this left man has already shown that he's a damn good cricket player.
Moan may not be exactly what he needs for his county of Woostershire, but he's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches with "third Batsman" before being released in 2001.
He won three hundred and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my short relationship with him, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his exemplary statistics - an average of 31 bits and 35 balls - and think it's a risky rate, but among the spinners, there's a little pros, and the electors chose youth.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple practical additions to the trainer.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawordin, a Sri Lankan Batsman as a test match consultant, could be a workshop.
He's one of the best guys for the game that's gonna bring her the wealthiest experience gained under all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace in the setape.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, be it a game or a trainer, and, like Mahela, has a small intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said, can give new powers to the team.
Collega Collie's team, Darem Ben Stokes, is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone will agree, the coaches and the players do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The UK's exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron's unsettled policy to resume negotiations on keeping Britain in the EU every day is becoming more difficult, even without looking at the election of a genius Jeremy-- "Is it yes or no?" Corbin's a leibor leader or TUC's resentment about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraj.
A friendly European diplomat explained on the days that, in the current situation of the EU in various crises - not all of them of its own manufacture - some of the countries participating in the series are on the throat of the British egocentric agenda of the divisive concessions and the undermining of agreements, which they do not want to change.
When he met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided he didn't want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance travel through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a known local monument, to or without a local celebrity company, then come home and say they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European buddy, who wants to be interested in keeping Britain's external contacts under the EU Tent - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that the chord ministers and officials in some capitals reach an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German Chancellor, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before the situation deteriorates, as she has deteriorated for the residents of Tetcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Cola (16).
France's head, François Holland, is standing in front of a re-election or a replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland could soon receive the right-wing nationalist government, Spain the left.
It's hard to see them coming out of their skin to help the "selfi-brits" whose energy could be spent to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - which they don't want, too, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan for the release of deliberately useless SNP-style remarches during the British referendum campaign in 2017, in order to spur Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Reconsideration was an idea-fix" and "The Britain has received nothing valuable from the resumed negotiations."
Europeans know what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the EU has media-magents, as opposed to Tony Benn's launch in 1975, who supported our entry in 1973 with a 2-1 ratio.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, a European-subportunist, who was famous for his "direct EU bananas" by Brussels's correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a sandwich company from fear-free juvies, phone hackers, and non-resident pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair was totally the same opinion about them, but knowing that when you're in a bag of booze gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and tea again.
According to the fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself was in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, because Blair was guided by principles in favour of the repealed EU Constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of that.
But the sweetheart Jeremy Corbin, who snatched me on his back in Westminster on Monday, I told him he didn't have time to waste it on me, seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnoc's strategy "boot Murdock" from the '80s is a mistake and then, and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy for interaction with the press, not with me, but quite precisely with Andrew Marr, whose couch he sat in the Air Force on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I call evolution delicately.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside Ukip ' s tradiocinalist trend and a wider circle of small England ' s "partners" among tori may say yes.
It's the same as Hilary Benn, but not Bennett-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his internal Boy Scout refused to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell as the "tene" finance minister by Corbin was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father fought hard on TV for not being loyal to colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far and losing his post in the Cabinet.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "in all circumstances" is Benn's phrase - not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the pairs and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, in general view.
Whatever you want to tell Corbin's Democrats and "some guy" - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messages remains important in the 24-hour century of television seven days a week, and especially in social media, paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron get away so easily from Europe, allowing him to accept the proper support of the Labours during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main error of McDonnell and Corbin about membership in the EU - within the "Bannit" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer the issue of ezoteric discussion among the left dissidents for whom narcissism, born of minor difference, is the central principle in Dogmatian disputes.
With regard to his misconceptions about Nato, Tom Watson is steadfast that J.K. will not be agitating for the exit, foreign diplomats will have to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions when it can be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tori Government is cutting off the costs, which I was reminded of on Monday during lunch in a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency ' s statement that electronic cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking was made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to tobacco industry, as reported by researchers.
The experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report, the "provoking wind" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the relationship of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the "exclusively delicate argument" on which PHE built its main opinion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers wondered whether the statements were "hard or sensitive."
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "Fundamental principle of health - rules must be based on evidence of efficiency."
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" were based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is derived from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicryterial decision-making model to summarize their views on harm associated with various nicotine products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, a company whose director-general was reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes without mentioning the funding he had reportedly previously received from the Philippine Morris tobacco company.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of board members, but there were several known electronic cigarette supporters, some of whom also announced the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants in the meeting have experience in managing the tobacco case.
The meeting was also visited by the tobacco manager at PHE.
A scientific article published by the group "disguisedly agrees" that there is a lack of "good evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria" by McCaky and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell reported that PHE's statements that "there is currently no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or not smoking" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare in PHE, explained that BMJ's statements had previously been answered.
He said: "Electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence implies that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what is proven and what does not prove these evidence, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases a year, and smoking costs NHS at £2 billion a year.
It is clear that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the damage caused by smoking - we do our job before the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders series.
Former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give much for such a successful show as Albert's soap opera.
Johnson observed that licensing fees should only be used to create programmes that were not produced by other British television broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public broadcasting, which must be watching only a small part of the audience, at a peak airtime when competitors have a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director General of BBC Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson observed that he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to cooperate with BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't get rid of the thought that BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programmes that could show competing companies that are not receiving subsidies," told Johnson to members of the House of Lords Communications Committee in order to determine the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licensing fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should only keep on air those programs that are not issued and are not intended to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is aired in the primes because creators want the greatest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show him is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why retrogressive taxes should be financed by transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
The other channels would certainly give much for it.
I don't understand how it could be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would somehow lower the BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of chasing "for staff ambition and because of their belief that it was the best way to get long-term support."
His comments on the most popular show on BBC are rehearsed with the comments of Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson observed that the lower BBC transmissions of a public nature "should continue to go to BBC4 where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the company's function has been completed, and this may be presented as an argument in the Hange sermons that justify revenue from license fees of £4 billion: "Yeah, of course, we do all these undisguised transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a desk where no one's ever gonna watch them.
With regard to the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I encourage you to find a more retrogressive system as far as it is concerned, who will get the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people with 150 pounds of money, I'm interested, they think that's because they don't look very well and listen to BBC.
The former executive director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "information, education and entertainment."
He noted that only a small fraction of BBC products were now formally classified as educational - he said - 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent on radio - and that the company had to capture the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan "information, education and entertainment."
On partnership issues, Elstein observed that BBC should make more efforts in such areas as "Command concerts" (only some of them, he said, appear on TV), as well as enter alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
"Sonogenicity" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change the direction of movement when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms from a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound wave ulphides.
The tiny nematodes change the direction of the movement at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses, too high for the human ear to hear them.
Impulses are influenced by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on the subject: Researchers manage brain activity using light
Scientists explained that worms demonstrated the potential of a new methodology called "seogenicity," which was the use of ultrasound to trigger certain cells of the brain, heart and muscle, and the source of ultrasound was outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the brain and used in Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms usually don't react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were starting to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles are increasing ultrasound waves that then penetrate worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the structures called "TPP-4" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves force these ion channels to open and trigger the cells associated with them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create a nematode that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their engine neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activated modified engine neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetic" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and turn off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that comes to the right part of the brain on the optic fibre, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass freely through the tissue of the body, so they do not need to go inside the skull box for delivery.
" We believe that the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals in clinical settings, " said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertisements are mocking the British arms trade
See Amnesty International's video protest against an arms exhibition.
Fabulous killer drones!
Smells of iron candals!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-shuffle truncheons causing unbearable pain, but not leaving traces!
A strong voice and animation is without doubt that this promotion of the largest international arms exhibition, the Hebrew edition, designed by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to "throw" weapons to repressive regimes, using the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems at the ExCeL centre in Doklands.
Another topic: DSEI Arms Exhibition: authoritarian regimes are going to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden emergence of many posters on bus stops and on subway trains, which require a look at them again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is it written on one of them by the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line, turning into a tank's trophy.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the arms from coming out.
300 posters are painted by artists who put their jobs at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A group called the "Occident Patrol" team helped spread them over London using the "advertizer kit," a 6-pound set of garage keys, which is said to have "access to about one third of the advertising space on the world's bus stops."
London's transporters weren't funny about such vandalism in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodial announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, Cruel Designs and Professor at the University of Essex, artists become more demanding and seek to bring political art to an audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protesters, realizing that they have to go into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against an arms exhibition, welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by VCCP, which works pro bono, using a graphic designer and a sounding artist who also works free of charge.
The VCCP director, Matt Lever, was struck by a commercial titty around an arms exhibition, with a pass at Excel calendar, and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "to fill her houses with bright colors and animation proved to be a more exciting occupation."
"They incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the British Government to take measures and guarantee that the torture equipment will not be illegally sold at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of an arms exhibition goes from within ExCeL, where participants sell fantastic euphemical products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order for "AT4CS RS to shoot from the shoulder" from the U.S. Army.
It includes "without an analog of cumulative warfare, which produces an unexplained abandoned action inside the target."
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight gold rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the happiest smiles of those I've been annoying - and numerous, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I learned can be divided into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can vary from a little nervous to a totally frightening one.
He wants to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you took academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin, and why you're "fair, I don't love or hate "Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a trembling extract from HAHHAHAHAHA, I'm gonna be in my place."
Take a break.
And help others take a break, too, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had eyelashes, and they'd be giving fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People ' s rooms are often turned into petals, semi-annual cinemas and common party places, but they are also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
Still on the subject: Don't even think about going to university while in a relationship.
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room must be a safe house, but many dormitories form a culture of ditching from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to rebuild power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I need you to be able to restore the energy I used to communicate with you."
Try to feel like a student is tired of communicating, not knocking at him, but sending SMS.
Speaking of the knock, do it.
One guy in my dorm followed that principle: if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baked food.
Since you're starting a university life at the peak of Bake-off's popularity, knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and deliver a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange act, doesn't like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I baked something for you, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
It's a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Bad blind comics of flour, sugar and fat will make people pretend to sleep when you knock at them.
The theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the assignment of someone's chicken is theft, but isn't it stealing a little milk for tea?
You can handle the owner of the milk.
He's probably gonna ask you not to be shy, even if it boils from rage inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you, but try to treat it as an adult than my neighbor, who poured in her milk a liquid for washing dishes to avenge someone who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make any noise that would prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people from the glass house talk.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor to lower the sound of the drum and the bass guitar, because she had three hours in the morning, and she had an exam this morning.
The neighbor then increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, and then she ripped off her music and locked the door behind herself by going to a three-hour exam.
Wasn't it romantic if your future husband had settled in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extreme, before you bite your elbows, clumsier if you took a neighbor for your future husband, got involved, broke up with him, and should have seen him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you don't, but if a hot neighbor isn't exactly your future husband, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
At the moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the pranks and the grass is thinner than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite in a few seconds.
Teaching a valuable and interesting security lesson, hiding something - but never pack someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone's door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll then put in the freezer, but don't put someone else's stuff in Blue-Tack to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after Apple update
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, choosing General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some faced problems after installation, when an error was reported to them that "the amendment of the application has not been possible."
In order to avoid this, users are encouraged to either wait until the recovery slows down or try to update through iTunes.
The phone clues will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple minimized the probability of the action by reducing the amount of the update, and also simplified the implementation by means of a special utility that proposes to delete the annexes and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
It is worth making sure that your phone is loaded or close to the charger in order to prevent the discharge of the battery when updating.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone in the process may lead to a malfunction in updating.

IOS 9 now includes new functions, including an improved personal assistant, and innovations that increase iPad productivity, as well as settings that increase speed and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Asad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism - unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power," the representatives of the U.S. State Department have stated.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the US commitment to fighting the "Islamic State" within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Asad would never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the US "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to confront the "Islamic State."
Last Friday, White House representatives stated that they did not know exactly what Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, the White House spokesman, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime as "a win-win rate."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that further support for Assad would only aggravate the situation.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result the situation deteriorated," the President of the United States said.
Intake boats will be exempted from customs duties.
Mineconomy intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means of recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty-free imports have been prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Laskin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies - Minegon Development, Mintransu Russian Federation, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MES, FSB, FTS, Rostourism - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yacht.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about 200 million go annually to the treasury of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yacht.
Russia ' s Ministry of Economination has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on amending the List of Goods provisionally imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating recreational and sports facilities.
In the Ministry ' s view, this will certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, noted Lakskin.
This issue was brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs and Tariff Regulation, Non-tariff Protection of Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the authorities.
As noted by the representative of Minecon Development, the proposed measure for full conditional release at import was essentially a concession.
Therefore, after the adoption of the protocol, the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, Minegonom Development, would propose to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EEA member States, explained Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical tools and religious objects.
In the press service of the Ministry of Public Information, the Russian Federation reported that it had issued binding orders on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provided for simplified procedures for the processing of the entrance and exit of small-scale, sports sailing and pleasure craft at the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the Captains of the Seaports of Crimea to ensure a simplified procedure for the entry of small-scale, sports sailing and pleasure craft at the seaport and the exit of the listed ships from the seaport.
The Ministry has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the Russian Federation to approve the boundaries of the Crimea seaports.
In the case of Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been issued and the rest are in the process of being agreed upon, and the authorities have noted in the press service.
According to Mintrans, State supervision, classification and inspection, State registration of small craft used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting that is due to poor infrastructure.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a whole constantly evolving industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything stands in place.
Our coast is not interesting, the only piece where yachts can be exploited round year by year is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helenjik, Novos Russia, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that there are very strict border regulations in this area: a lot of permits are required to take a walk in the yacht.
Besides, there's no way to refuel a boat inside Russia.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then the problem is where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special yacht hangars up to 30 m. The yachts are also being deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich, but the demand for yachts had declined since the onset of the crisis.
The World Bank has allocated US$ 500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," mentioned in the communication.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Timao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help restore credit in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank had seen the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish Government had previously approved a loan to Ukraine of 100 million, and had transferred the "RIA News" to Ukraine.
In prisons, they are asked to create separate units for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Sentenced Persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of establishing separate units for transgender and transvestite inmates in colonies.
A member of the Council, Vladislav Grib, spoke about it.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons who had not been identified with sex in Russia, it might be possible in domestic prisons to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many such criminals) with a view to establishing a special colony for transgender persons.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is only possible to determine whether citizens can be sentenced to such isolated places after convicted persons undergo appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice had been successful abroad: SIZO (where the accused were before a court decision) provided separate cells for transgender persons and correctional facilities for special units.
Today is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgenderers in normal cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for FIS staff.
The lowering of transmissions by the inmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city, how many criminals with undefined floors, it is necessary to count on where to distribute them.
SIZOs are definitely not needed - only cells, blockages in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
Grib explained that 50 or 100 persons could be held in the unit, and if the specialized corps were established in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners could be admitted to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in SIZO at the scene of the crime, so the receipt of transvestite or transgender persons from other actors during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but the introduction of such practices for already convicted prisoners in a separate colony - yes - considers Grib.
Remember, the day before, law enforcement officers were unable to determine which remand centre, male or female, to identify a detainee for possession of drugs by a 24-year-old transsexual, Dmitri Kojkov (known as Alina Davis), for which reason a man with a girl appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under the signature of a failure.
This news has been widely discussed in social media networks and media, as there is really no transgendering mechanism in SIZO and colonies in Rosia.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseyev supported the idea of creating special places to serve sentences by transgender people, noting that it is also possible to identify people abroad in colonies - male or female - according to their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yeah, that's a very small percentage, but the problem exists, just like the issue of providing security for homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseyev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since they are more in prison than transgender people.
However, Alekseyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to surrender themselves for transcexuals in order to get to a different colony than the usual colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before you put people in a transgender colony, but not always everything is clear.
For example, in the U.S., one of Chelsea Menning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the floor, said the Alekseys.
A man can feel anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve their sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison officers will think seriously about the safety of such people and be sensitive to their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the commencement of sentences by convicted prisoners.
A commission is being set up, a question of sexuality, and psychiatrists conduct long-term surveillance, not one test based on high-level imprisonment.
Today's psychiatry opportunities allow that to happen.
Therefore, before changing the sex, potential patients are always subject to such assessments - they clearly show whether changing sex with surgical intervention is the necessary measure - says Lordkipanids.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system against convicted prisoners, since on average it takes a month to do so.
The doctor, while generally supporting the establishment of separate units for transsexuals, also doubts whether it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, transgender units in Russia in the current economic environment.
It is difficult to calculate, there is no official statistics, but given that homosexuals in Russia are about 5 per cent, transgenderers are even smaller and those who have such a rejection and also commit crimes are very few, Lordkipanids said.
At present, homosexuals, transgender persons are entitled to separate conditions of detention upon application to the administration of the colony.
Michael Antipov won the Junior World Championship on chess.
The World chess Championship in Hunt-Mansysk ended with young people under 20 years of age.
The end of the first race was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became a luxuryist, Mikhail Antips, who was able to finally kick up the Yan-Kshystof Doood Pole, who seemed to have gone to the title with confidence.
The girls won the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The chess world championship, which had taken place since early September in Hunt-Mansysk, was already at the middle of the tournament, seemed to have lost almost all of the intrigue, since the Polish representative Jan-Kszystof Duda, who had issued a series of four wins (the Swiss system was held in 13 tours), had clearly taken over leadership.
Given that Duda was the ranking of the original, and indeed considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would lose the output was very small.
And even when Duda reduced his turnover and allowed the Russians Mikhail Antipov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the battle for title.
Because the Antips had to win the 13th tour to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Dud your party.
Plus, this bound victory, of course, could have affected the game of a Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He was sure to deal with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for his party to finish Dud's meeting with Benjamin Bock.
Luckily for the Antips, the Polish chess player fought the Dutch whiskey.
Thus, Antips and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antips had the best additional indicators.
That is why he is the leader of the Hunt-Mansian Autonomous District, whose governor Natalia Komarov has traditionally paid great attention to the development of chess in the region, and has been given the principal prize.
There was no intriguing ending in the girls' competition.
The leader of the tournament - Natale Buxe (Ukraine) - was enough not to lose in the final tour to win the title, which she had succeeded in doing.
Thus, Alina Bivol's Russian victory prevented her from catching Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second to lag behind the 0.5-point championship.
The regional structure is changing by a poppelling.
The company brings together the Voljsk and Ural regions to one large Volzko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East to the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Director of Vimpelcoma, Mikhail Slobodin, noted, changes are being made to "be a strong player in the market" and to develop a company "in new, not always favourable external conditions."
In an interview with the Russian 24 television channel, Mr. Slobodin explained that they intended to reduce the "ten per cent" of personnel in Russia.
He checked 78 Moskov snacks of Burger King and issued 367 requirements.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam Highway has been fined 50,000 roubles and a facility on the Greater Toul Street has been closed for 90 days but has resumed work after all violations have been resolved.
43 snacks violated the requirements of the facility.
Among other violations, poor sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements were found in some facilities by a group of intestinal sticks.

Igor Artemiyev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency opposed the indexation of 10 per cent of freight charges and the provision of State-subsidies, as requested by the RZZO.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion dollar budget subsidies, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, turn away from expensive mansion, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that FAS had its "more stringent" proposals, which were being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net deduction from Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of carrying out a full-time travel contribution of $300 million, reported to the gold mining company.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of equity for Sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement the option or require payment.
The details of the Polimetal negotiations are not disclosed.
The option was entered into as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing a procedure for the sanitaryization of developers.
"We understand that there is no escape from this, so a mechanism is being developed," the official said.
The blacks of the Civil Kane script will be put on the bidding.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported plans to put a black version of the Civil Kane scenario, which is considered to be one of the best works of the director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
Auction will start in the city of Kalabas on 29 September and will present three black versions of the scenario, the estimated value of each of them being $20-30,000, and will transfer AP.
The first of the blacks, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second is a more complete version of the script, the third is the final design of the film.
Mintemptorg: Targeted food aid will not be an equivalent card in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtoukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the equivalent of the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate the word "food card."
I would like to point out in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the end-of-life total deficit, the distribution card system, where the quantity of products received is normalized.
We have proposed a concept for the time being if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," the TSS says to Mr. Evtukhov.
Previously, JO wrote that the food card programme for the poor was introduced into the government.
For more information on the Minpromtorgue initiative, read in "JO" the Igor Shuvalov commissioned the preparation of food cards.

President Alexander Bobresov of the RZD resigns his post.
The Vice-President of the Russian Railways (RZZD) for Corporate Security, Alexander Bobresov, leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-Premier of Russia, the President of the Board of Directors of the RZA, Arkady Dvorkovic, said that the issue of the departure of Alexander Bobresov from the RZD had been initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Belozer.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the staff changes in the management of the RCD are not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, "JO" reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakunin OAO, RZZ was headed by the First Minister of Transport, Peterburgez Oleg Belozer, who supervised the financial block.
For the first time, the new head of the company announced reforms in monopolies: a new freight tariff system would be introduced in a year and a half.
Read more about the company's transformations in the "JO" version of the RCD will rewrite the price tags.
This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers over the year by identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year ' s ratings.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as the candidate for the current year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the original candidates is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies who would be useful in adding candidates to the pool.
The following company ' s functional managers may be nominated: Financial Director, Business Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Government, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert ' s proposed manager is invited to participate in the ratings and is given the opportunity to present its management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on a sectoral basis is based on the industry classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forestry industries, engineering, media industry, metals, multidisciplinary cholera, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer services and production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceutical industry, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a lounge and password to enter www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can present their assessments on the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the principle of Best Choices: Top managers assess top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the most authentic evaluation of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating shall be approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All current year ' s candidates and multiple candidates for the previous year ' s ratings are invited to attend the regular meetings of the expert commissions.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions to approve the heads of functional direction.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed prior to the issuance of the ratings) or to update them in accordance with the attached roster of reserve candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of the "JO."
At the time of the issuance of the rating, there could be changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfort rate for the investment rate is 10-13%.
Experts estimated that the small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April of this year was 40 per cent.
What is your estimate of the situation today?
After the panic of the end of 2014 and early 2015, ICB lending declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
The 25 to 30 per cent annual credit was not beneficial to anyone.
If the bank could have put all of its possible problems at a higher rate in the future, from prunes to non-returns, it is now impossible to do so: the stakes and so on.
For business, the current level of credit rates of the ISA is not comfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is not sustainable.
The rate of 10-13 per cent would enable business to invest in and generate attractive returns across a wide range of projects.
How do you estimate the demand for loans for entrepreneurs is met?
The situation has improved slightly since the decline in the CB interest rate.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients have started to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future incomes.
Today, business has one way: it is necessary to learn to work in terms of today ' s economic situation in the country and region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely, monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, with financial resources available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make the products more competitive and to keep the business even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the credit market of the ICB that will strengthen and influence its development before the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now demonstrating consistency in lowering the key rate.
However, the drastic fall in the credit price for the ICB is not worth waiting.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem, making the necessary higher interest rate to generate real income.
Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the level of delay, traditional small and medium-sized business companies, which are limited both in cash replenishment opportunities and in economic behaviour adjustment options, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, like any other brand model, which is attractive outside, technically perfect inside.
Japan's "Japanese" is the only way to bring the country's rising sun's products to a state of complete joy.
You can make any arguments for cars from other countries, and a person even agrees in principle with these arguments, but the whole conversation will fall apart from the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people must probably love not only technology, but also all other Japanese.
It's not, not in the kimono, of course, but in the canons of a street Japanese fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniforms are the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict.
And the girl's older, the skirt's shorter.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But to a greater extent, the shape of the car changes the new pattern of headlamps and rear lamps, where the car will immediately find itself in the flow of cars.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
Silouet is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the appearance is strict.
We don't have to call the police.
There is only a static Japanese calm behind CX-5, one of the safest in the world.
The 2.3 l diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
However, the fuel consumption of this engine of 175 litres, with a capacity of only 5.9 litres. The powertrain shall be coupled with an exclusively automatic transmission and a complete transmission.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
In order to add a little black humor to this image, you can select leggins with a piston from police tapes Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to keep you out of the CX-5 drive.
In order to further improve comfort while maintaining excellent control, the suspension has remodeled the design of the front and rear amortizers and optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The full drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds has been reduced by 13 per cent.
Cupper in flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if a girl's in a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role-player genre.
She'll get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, which provides the optimum space for both the broad shoulders and for long legs - who have what they have.
The longer ones will certainly appreciate the fact that the foot in the front of the central tunnel is now soft and don't hit the ankles in the vibes.
The largest set of active security systems in Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
They use radars, lasers and cameras to detect a potential threat.
There's an adaptive lighting here, and a warning of a lane shift, and the monitoring of dead areas, and a safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the classroom.
A convenient, minimum-off, it contains a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are divided into a ratio of 4:2:4 with each section fitted with separate worn-out rudders and increased the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The suit of a cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi."
It's particularly embarrassing to look like a pajamas kigurum.
There's everything in it!
Of course I'll sleep.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
'Cause it's so great when it's possible to choose, like, cool clothes, behavior or car.
Thank you for helping prepare the material for the Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic ear.
Kiev has formalized Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the development of the Hmelnitzka nuclear power plant.
Highly happy Wednesday from the second attempt, however, voted in favour of the termination of the Moscow agreement.
The arrangements for the construction of the third and fourth blocks were signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project was still not operational.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law breaking the agreement concluded between 2010 and 2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Khmelnitzka nuclear power plant.
The bill submitted by the Government had only been successful in the second ballot, with 210 deputies supported for the first time, with a minimum of 226 members, but 234 members of Parliament had then voted in favour of the draft.
The Hmelnitzka nuclear power plant under the Soviet Union was to count four power units on 1 GW with VER-type reactors, but only two were built.
The negotiations with Moscow on the build-up led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and, in 2011-2012, Rada passed relevant laws.
As no funds were available in Ukraine ' s budget, it was anticipated that the blocks would have to be built on the Russian side ' s loan, but the funds had never been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling between the two Kiev countries, Kiev began to turn down relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring no cooperation on the Hemelnitz nuclear power plant and the project for the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for active Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as while the Ukrainian NAEC "Energy" had not been replaced by Russian supplies.
The plans for the development of the Hmelnitzka nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as early as 2014, the Czech Skoda JS was under negotiation in Kiev.
UN Gensek against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," gives AP his answer to a question about the military support of Syria from Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Foreign Ministry of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian Federation, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that Gentlemanship did not exclude the possibility of establishing a future Air Force base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
"But all things may be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, "JO" reported that the US did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group "Islamic State" banned in the Russian Federation.
Read more about US doubts about Russia's assistance to Syria in "J" material, the Russian military presence in Syria is concerned with Washington.
OSCE PA reports a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," the TASS cites the words of Mr. Gerasymov.
He also called for compliance with the mine agreements and "returning to the normal functioning of our countries."
On the question of whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level was now possible - in the Normand format or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasimov, observed that the dialogue had taken place, there were mine agreements.
At the same time, the policy stated that any kind of dialogue was supported in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the ex-President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and the Lugan Republic had not changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations in principle, but the tone of dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod Election Commission summarized the results of the municipal dome elections, demarcating 12 deputies ' mandates on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been raised by representatives of the CDF who accused the beating of "fallowing" fraud.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
On the other hand, the Communist Party of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the abolition of the payment for the construction of multi-family homes.
The city beat officially presented the results of the elections to the proud Nizhny Novgorod on the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the electoral rolls in Lower Novgorod, 746,700 were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 117,000 ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the "One Russia" lists, six deputies in pride rely on Dmitrie Svatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasili Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Viacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky received the only mandate of LDPR.
The two mandates of the CPR are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of the State Duma, Alexander Tarnayev.
The three mandates of the "fair Russia" come from Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must determine whether they will serve as members of the city ' s Duma: if the mandate is abandoned, they will proceed to the next Partz List candidate.
The Chairman of the Gorizbikrom, Alexander Makeev, informed the Commission that he was on duty to send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others for waiver of mandates.
During the adoption of the electoral protocol, the representatives of the CDF reported multiple violations.
A member of the Horizbikrom with the right to consult the RCF, Leonid Krasnocutsky, suggested that the vote should not be accepted in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, under the order of the Head of Administration of the Sorm region, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, had been closed.
Neither the deputies of Goss were able to pass in a long time, neither the candidates themselves nor the observers themselves, and a rehearsal scandal with the flight door was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote in the district commissions were able to attend.
The head only stopped access when the ballot ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballot papers.
This was done with a view to preventing all provocations.
"At the time the chapter was corrected, and all the meetings were attended by interested persons," a member of the mountains of Natal Andrüshin's beard.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration, more than four hours had been illegally held by the deputy of Ludmil Arista District Assembly, on which a statement had been sent to the investigating committee.
The opposition also complained that, in a number of UICs, on election day, the Urns began to be sealed at 6 to 7 a.m., placing ballot papers on them for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the commissions, with the right to be heard and observers, did not notify anyone, so they had already come to the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that, in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, ballot papers could be uncontrollable.
However, the mountains have already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, no violations of the unrecorded ballot papers have been found.
The members of the Commission did not support the proposal of their colleague, Maria Popova, from the "Just Russia," to proceed with the amendment of regional legislation in order to establish clearly the opening time for the opening of the envelopes with the bulletins of early voting, which then enter the box.
"In your own initiative, go to the CEC," advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the session, CDF member Sergei Samhin, who cried out that the beating ignored dozens of complaints and covered the falsification of elections, was hit with a high level of accusations by the chairman.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful to make a statement!" was offended by the president of the bark.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
Until 27 September, the overall results of the elections should be approved by the bark, followed by the first meeting of the 6th Nizhny Novgorod City Duma within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the municipal electoral commission denied the political party Communists of Russia the registration of the action team for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the discussion of the suburbans: whether they agreed that the charges for the construction of multi-family homes should be "restricted immediately" and the tariffs on housing and utilities "freeze before 2020."
However, the lawyer of the mind of Irina Maslov explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, with a decrease in projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time, FedEx reported last year that they would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares increased by about 2.5 per cent on pre-bids 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which was 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts assumed $10.84 under the FactSet review.
The projected decrease is despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in the ground freight charges for heavy or surface cargo, which began in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the previous year by reducing expenditure, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company "worked in a stable manner, given the weak economic conditions as compared to the forecast, especially in production and world trade."
Plans to recruit workers on holidays were announced the day after the application of the competition, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly as many as they had been employed last year.
For the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 per cent over a year earlier.
The income to the account was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per account conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a recession in the international transport sector, resulting in a lack of gross income growth in its express transport unit.
However, the Internet purchase boom dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from land transport increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs of large shipping and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher labour costs.
On pre-bids about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange, $3,85 or 2.5 per cent fell to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most anticipated meeting in several years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
In one end, a rich, decorated meeting room, two-story high, will be wearing a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, should place the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double request from Congress: to maximize employment in the US and to keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system have recognized that there is also a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is prepared to avoid the unpredicted stimulus provided by almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can deter already cautious leaders of the Federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate for federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Peggs, the chief brokerist of the Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"One day I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes that increased uncertainty around the world market, enough to justify them to wait further," she noticed.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself causes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid recovery.
This may result in a fall in the equity market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not mitigate the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Doe-Johns index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The flight was prompted by the expectation that the policy makers of the Federal System would remain on board this week, said John Lonski, the chief economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research group.
"It's gonna be a surprise if the Federal System increases the stakes at this point of time," he noticed.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve system does so, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to have been inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected to raise the rate this year, despite complaints from the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment declined to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank ' s annual target of 2 per cent, the management of the Federal System stated that the temporary impact of the sharp fall in oil prices was a key cause.
The economy "can cope with and need higher rates, given the decline in the labour market," noted Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The average Doe-Johns index for industrial companies fell by only 16 per cent of the relatively high value in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in China's economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially recovered its positions this month, and the Doo-Johns index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve system, market disturbance further complicates the difficult calculation of interest-rate increases.
"In the absence of information on what happened in financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would turn around the gykes at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliver, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former member of the Federal Reserve System.
It is now projected that they will wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty about what the impact on the American economy may have, and they almost lack reliable data after recent events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal system and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The Central Bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
One suggestion from the then President, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Federal Reserve System could "smart" its monetary expansion caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process, "more art than science," was noted by Zachary Carabell, the leader of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Geoffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances of overreactions in the Federal Reserve system of financial market movements that do not seem to relate to economic principles."
Laker, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the decisions of 1998-99 as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, "in spite of the limited identifiable impact on growth in the United States," Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System cancelled these cuts.
The Federal Reserve should be placed at the top of the concern for stability only in times of large crises such as the collapse of the market in 2008" said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest-rate committee in Bank of England.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're scared of rising rates because markets are shaking," said Pozen, president of the Peterson World Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I do not think that they should be ahead of events.

The Speaker of the State Dumas, Sergei Narashkin, allows the US to deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees will sneak into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar at the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not in favour of conspirological theories, but the question is myself: is Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized North Africa and the Middle East with such manic perseverance in recent years?" he wondered.
"Someone must have thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death would go to the well-being of the EU," he added.
Narskin asked: "Have many political leaders in Europe spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally snatching their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers silence," he observed.
According to Narashkin, NATO is violating many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at and looked at the way in which the military sapogo of NATO's standards is emptied by moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," the Speaker stressed.
The Government forces and paramilitary forces loyal to them are opposed by the rebels, mostly of Islamists.
Subsequently, the terrorist group "Islamic State" that was banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The U.S. supports the rebels who oppose both Asad and IH.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of Western hostility to Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Asad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Roscia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian Gazette.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and place another in his place who would act in the interests of the Western countries, not in the interests of his own homeland, he noted.
Asad drew attention to the sharp coup d'état of Western media in Ukraine.
He said that, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in a non-democratic way, despite being elected by democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Asad to fight against the "Islamic State."
Commenting on the West ' s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people through elections, and if he left at the request of the people, rather than by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the President remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Asad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that they were cooperating with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iranian military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, economy and military.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran provides us with military equipment.
"It is true that there has been an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igil coalition, U.S. leaders," Asad pointed out.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State" prohibited in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition strikes the IG positions with air strikes.
In Utah, 12 people died of flooding.
In the Utah state of the United States, at least 12 people died as a result of the floods.
Another one is reported missing, handing over Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water washed several cars with the people in Washington County.
One of them, a family van, stopped in a dangerous area near the water, and the flow suddenly caught him.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All those who died were residents of the Colorado City and Hildale areas, where the poems struck.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
650 teams are involved in search and rescue.

Loverov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of John Kirby's Department of State.
It is noted that the subject of the interview was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide additional details.
In doing so, he stated that the US had tools for "the far-reaching isolation of Russia" if it supported Syrian President Bashar Assad, handed over RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov again stressed the need to establish a united front against terrorist groups operating in the territory of the country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
Some bilateral issues were also raised.
United States officials had previously stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow's support for Assad.
In Washington, it was stated that if Russia continued to support Asad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the Russian President, Dmitri Peskov, stated that the country would not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was occupied by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The U.S.-led international coalition strikes the position of IG with air strikes.
The beard called the American newspaper a slander on Strelkov.
The former chairman of the Government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said so in a telephone interview to the Lents.ru correspondent.
The note at Washington Post is beautiful because it's completely twisted.
The former Minister of Defence, Igor Strelkov, of course, did not connect and "go" him from the territory of the Republics of Donbass, in a very elevated mood, without rope, without three furs of money attributed to him by different characters, he noted.
According to Borodaya, Strelkov was really talking to the reporter of the American newspaper.
"Yeah, I said Strelkov was urgently required to remove the people's republic from the Donetsk territory," told the former head of the Government of the NPD.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the author of the American publication had decided to write that Strelkov had been taken to Russian territory "connected."
I suspect it's provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's amazingly misreading words, because I stressed that Strelkov was leaving himself," Borodai noticed.
"It's a slander to both me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Previously, on the pages The Washington Post came up with an article containing the words of Borodai that he had forcibly exported Strelkov to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to connect his partner.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with a gold Nazi.
The Polish timber industry began cutting trees over the underground tunnel, where it was reported that a train with the gold of the Third Reich was located.
The work began on Tuesday, 15 September, reporting to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the credibility of the rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
There may be arms and valuable minerals inside the train.
On 31 August, the governor of the Polish Nizhnesilian Vovodery, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous one.
However, the authorities decided to seal the search area.
Three days earlier, the Polish Vice-Minister of Culture, Peter Zhuhowski, stated that local "perceptible 99 per cent" cadets had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that, if assumptions were confirmed and jewels discovered, they would become property of the State Treasury, and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal firm clients reported to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbjih that they had found a train in a flooded tunnel 70 metres deep.
The Russian Federation's main drug dealer proposed banning the sale of tobacco to persons up to the age of 21.
Russia ' s main drug dealer proposed banning tobacco sales until 21 years.
Eugene Bruen noted that "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - has been particularly harmful before that age."
So he said live on the radio station "The Moscow State," commenting on the fact that Speaker Sovfeld Valentin Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
A man is being judged in an uneven way.
You can serve in the army from 18 years old, and you're physically ready for it.
He's mentally prepared for a full-fledged life in society since 21.
"It's known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally up to the age of 21, " says Brune.
Previously, Sultan Hamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and project leader of the "Track Russia," informed the "Exveys" that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age price of alcohol sales and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the issue again at the upper house of Parliament."
According to the activist, a working group would soon be established in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to verify compliance with the Law on Information Protection of Children
The resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to verify the Bible ' s compliance with the federal law on the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development, a statement was made on 16 September by correspondent Sib.fm.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he acquired a Bible in the Red Prospection of China City, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development."
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
The answer to the treatment of Novosibirsk will be provided within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to correspondent Sib.fm.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that's gonna break out of society.
It will start reading the Bible, which it has never done before.
The Brazilian Pediatric Union of Rio Grandi promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method by which to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves demonstrating images of infants living with breasts painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbs, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs of pregnant women and mothers, it is recommended that the daily calorie rate be increased by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, the recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers must make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, Professor of the Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that the healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train ran a school bus.
In the vicinity of Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
A 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move from the tracks, ordered 60 pupils to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, there was a clash in their eyes.
He was videoed by one of the students.
As a result of the emergency, a panic has emerged among the students.
Some children began crying and running along the side.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one suffered a miracle except one passenger who was slightly injured by a train.
The damage caused by the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) leadership called for the prohibition of boxing in the country after the death of the local sportsman David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a connection with Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles in the version of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category until 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a skull trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life support apparatus.
In a professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended up with nothing.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second fatality of Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old Bradon Smith student died of injuries in the ring.
Now, AMA recommends that it not be involved in this sport, but rather, in its view, that it be banned altogether.
I understand that this is not intended to happen, as Vice-President Stephen Parnis said.
But as the box now exists, there will always be situations where the athlete is bleeding or brain injury, which results in either death or severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narashkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narashkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said so at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We consider this to be unacceptable as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
Narashkin also called on the OSCE PA to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get the moral back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"The two things never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State Council called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiation and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Narashkin stated.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"It's almost the only common site where we're still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
We recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar, and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple or three days.
The World Champion on the Light Athlete of Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a 24-year-old tramlet from Barnaul Sergei SUBENKOVA.
He managed to win Europe's command, set a few records, and, above all, become the champion of the world, the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the sportsman recently won the final phase of the Diamond League, with a third total credit.
The New News asked Shubenko to share the impressions from the coming season.
Sergei, is the season still over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the World War War Games, which will take place in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna think about rest.
I'm really gonna be at home right now, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different condition.
It's easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said the autumn was your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passions after the main start of the season have slipped, the burden of liability is no longer heavy.
You can compete for pleasure at the "dissipone."
Plus, you know, vacations are too soon...
Do you have any fatigue?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
The fatigue at the end of the season always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what you did anymore - win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, moves, all of this doesn't go to the body without any trace.
You get physical and emotional.
But now I'm emotional, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy.
By the time you finished at the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it either.
But in fact, I think it's bad for an athlete who lives in old victory to turn his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory of a couple of days, and we have to move on.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something special.
We started preparing as early as December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Trained first at Barnaul's house, then at the assembly, then at home again.
It's as usual.
But the coach set the challenge of trying to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time was spent laying a base.
They ran a bunch of crosses, put in a general physical training exercise, which included both a tractor and a seat, and we ran our backs.
Then we went for the barrier training, and we did a lot of equipment.
You've been following the rivals?
I always try to do that, the good of the Internet era there's no problem with it.
I saw Europe's Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint, the whole pedestal was taken by the French!
I thought I had to do something, get this company to go down.
With every start in this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons going around exactly the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running at 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always twist my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do is run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this result.
But the paradox is, you kind of feel like you're ready for a move, and it's not always possible to show your willingness at the competitions.
How was that at the Olympics in London, for example?
I, to be honest, tried to forget the semi-final race.
Ready to be very good, I could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had repeated my best result at that time, it would have been a bronze prize for the game.
But you're not lucky.
Do you remember your first World Championship?
What about it?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get into the finals, it was such a maxim program.
And he fell off the street, in the precipitous run.
Then I realized I was gonna rip my head off, so I didn't get anywhere to run.
Two years later, the world's championship in Moscow was already in the final stage with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive race: I wanted to win the gold already!
How's it gonna work out by developing a decent speed, not losing your head, not turning it off?
And this is the hardest thing to do.
You need to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't break the barriers.
I've noticed that when you're not on the results, it's so much easier to process.
And the very high you feel like you're running and everything's gonna work out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the depth after the first major successes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Never had that thought?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better terms, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
You've been together for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, he's been in a light athlete.
I mean, first I trained his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped in length, triple.
The kid's multiborium was -- it's when the ball is washed, jumping in length from place...
At 14, he tried running with the barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race, it was possible to meet the second adult grade.
That's how it's left.
There's never been a fear in front of the barriers?
Somehow I made a deal with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work on the technique.
There's been a lot of misery over one race!
But this routine isn't going anywhere.
The tech needs to be pulled all the time - so I can wake up at night, I'm up right now and I'd run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw you running in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually re-examine my race, and I couldn't resist it.
But efficiency needs to be further worked - there is no limit to perfection.
Don't you worry now that winning a year before the Olympics will be a heavy load on your shoulders?
As they say, I will try to live up to expectations.
If you choose this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no additional cargo should be felt.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are pissed, I understand their bread isn't gonna be worth it. Give it to the enemy.
And even though I didn't wear the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and I didn't call anyone directly a bastard, I got hit by another one.
All of my aliases are in the middle of a second, evaporated.
The pressing that I'm being subjected to is so strong that even I, who saw the species of a kid, thinks that people are bald.
As if he was walking, walking, and you were attacked by a crowd, and you were mutilating your feet.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm gonna give it to you, old me, guys, to be scared.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing I ever had was self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And to give passports to assholes as Fred Durst or Monson can only be jerks.
I'd rather be a better journalist, a hard job.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described Crimean events in sharp form:
What you did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to the way Chruschchev's supplicate attempted to sign something never fits into the general picture of the human dorm.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his apartment...
The war from the Kremlin is gone, and it's only gonna end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started by calling some bastard from the wall of the Kremlin.
I have any idea who that might have been...
Cobson doesn't have much to live.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took him down a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting to their little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven is in the ratings despite attempts by Nine to highlight the success of leaders in Today Show
Carl Stefanović and Lisa Wilkinson's departure to Canberra to highlight the implications of the Liberal Party's announcement of the release of the leader's seat was unable to significantly raise the Today rating.
The ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull Toni Abbott was defeated.
The competition is Sunrise, with the leading David Koh and Samantha Armitadge, stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture does not seem to be of great importance to Australian viewers, although Sunrise's audience was 397,000 viewers in five of the largest cities compared to the Today audience of 339,000.
Today was slightly higher than its rating on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 on Today.
That's the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
An important news for Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the ex-star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
The critics wondered if Tomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters Rebecca Gibney's star.
The result of last night is a loud answer to yes.
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with a audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily sharing the Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seventh, luck and failure were mixed at the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV station that Andrew O'Kif had gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGwayr (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 viewers and the second half hour was the overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia's ratings for the second evening will make Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement of Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to play the McGwire show.

Three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he gonna choose?
Is the secret solved?
Lana Jevon Fallows, Sarah McKay and Snowy Marcoski may have accidentally given an idea which one of them will win at Holostyak.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in Holostyak is surrounded by a cover of secrets.
And the three girls who reached the final end, of course, keep silent about which one of them received his last rose.
But when I met Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows before the day when two of the three girls were supposed to stay, they might have given an unexpected clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the end of Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood explaining why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, dedication, family values, vitality as the reason why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If you are not, who should have the last rose of Wood?" they could have been reluctant to say which one of them actually won the heart of the Holostian.
Jevons Fallows and Marcoski had no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
There's been a good relationship between Sarah and Sam since the first day.
"From the moment I became a member, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam and realized that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jevons Fallows.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easy and fun," she added Marcoski.
I saw them together, and there's really a tension between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah MacKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
MacKay himself said that thanks to her house visits last week, she realized that Wood might be the "that's the man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and kinsmen, I realized it wasn't just a game - I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
To the question that Wood should choose if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesdays at 19.30 on the Ten channel.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career at the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after his move to the United States, as were the many other clubs that had asked after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which former Australian league player rugby released at the first return of a punt in a winning game with Minnesota with an account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayn another chance to get his punt back, and also used him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed herself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of throwing a tear on the new guys in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
The special reporter of the 49ers Cam Inman Club reported that Hayne also received support from the coordinator of the special team, Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball to the back of the pant by the Minnesota Wykings team during the first quarter.
This is the beginning of the debut at NHL Hain and his many Australian fans clearly did not count.
It was seen that Hayn was fighting after losing his ball, and later he told the lead show, "Hamish and Andy," on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not have imagined a better start for a career in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you just think about the next game and everything," said Hayne.
Hein compared his miss to his debut in the Original series in 2007, when the ball throw in his credit zone tried Queensland.
In the end, this experience has proved very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and took a picture to Instagram.

President Vladimir Putin was publicly challenged, Khodorkowski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were halted.
Migrants clashed with the police at the border of Hungary.
The refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian village of Resk, which had grown into clashes with law enforcement personnel.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water and tear gas and handed over Reuters.
Migrants throw police stones and try to tear down the border fence.
Support is being directed to the scene of the clashes, police are responding to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees had been able to break through a police cordon, followed by dozens of migrants fleeing into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serb-Hungarian border on buses towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports Bi-bi-si.
The country ' s authorities had allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and to transport them from there to the country in question.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened its legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian Court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider in the near future the transfer of border protection functions to the Hungarian armed forces by the Hungarian Parliament.
In late June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
Russiann admitted to having committed the largest cyber attacks in the history of the United States.
The accused of the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States of America, Mr. Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the New Jersey State Federal Court, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage caused by the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Such respondents, like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," stated U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years of imprisonment and a fine of millions of dollars.
In sentencing, the court will take account of the Russian confession and may reduce its sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitri Smilian, was taken into custody.
The last of his guilt in the crimes against him denies.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, with Russia's support, of the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," the report published on the United States Department of State website.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the Islamic State (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary of State, Asad will never be able to be a reliable member of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
On the eve, the spokesperson for the White House of Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if he did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic State."
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and helped Syrians develop technology to use it against Islamists.
Four dead when the police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the proposed new Constitution, as the official official stated on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishno Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered from a police station, some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas, then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in southern, plain Nepal, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10.
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislature has accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and the officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise of 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkut province.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borowski.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the Regional Correspondent.
Oleg Valerievich, why did you start working as mayor?
I first read the results of the financial and economic audits, initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document flow to five days.
Previously, court papers could have been walking for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the income base and to optimize costs.
Last November, a visiting meeting of the Government was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project-reading documentation (MSD) in the city for any facility.
Without this, Sayansk was unable to participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the POJA on roads, kindergarten, northern sewers and water.
Roadworks are already under way in two sections.
How is the Russian President ' s decree on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of the availability of places in kindergartens for today is one of the most pressing.
Since 1 September, it has closed down for the major maintenance of Child Squad No. 10 for 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
In the past year, after renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened and 200 children are currently attending.
The renovation was made on a co-financing basis from the regional and local budgets, costing more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the Administration and the assistance of the regional Government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the programme "Indigenous Initiatives" was also supported.
There are plans to begin the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With his introduction, we plan to eliminate the priorities of children between the ages of one and a half and three years.
We don't have a target for children from three to seven years old.
Investors have an interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, and that it is their job that needs to be done.
Already in October, 60 apartments for orphans in the Leningrad neighbourhood are being put into operation.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Pryangaria, which has entered the eco-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 units will begin soon.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing that we wish to participate in the programme very much.
One condition is that housing should not be more than 30,000 rubles per square metre, which includes a key section.
If we manage the range, we'll continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In its time, a Sayan pigmplex was built in the Territory, which was sold for no price in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land is subject to federal ownership.
Work with Moscow is under way and 88 hectares are being transferred to regional property, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There's a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
We're gonna have 900 jobs with a pork sticker, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Social Partnership Institute developed in Sayansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
A number of projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the East Centre ZAO, the New-Zimin TEV, the Sayane Broiler OO, the PK CDF, provide support, and the management of these enterprises respond to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the City of Sayan Broyler, he gave the city to the children's town, and the East Centre has repaired the concubine, where specialists deal with the children of the iparatherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship, the city's administration has been well established.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city's Day with beauty.
As in the old good days, a parade was held with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
The city's flight record, a book of Sayane poets, was released.
The masters and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska have been given commemorative medals.
Mecensaries also participate in the city charity.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been designed to support talented people, to help children in need of expensive treatment to support children from low-income families.
How are the human problems in the social sphere being addressed in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for professionals is crucial to addressing the human resources issue.
In the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been provided with office accommodation.
We have a housing allocation program that can privatize it in five years.
Plans include the remodelling of a building that will build an additional eight teachers ' apartments.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the "Pililla for the Russian family" programme.
In the long run, building a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there is a working team in the city that I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sayanska and our region have a great potential.
A bill on indexation of social pensions has been submitted to Duma in view of the increase in prices.
A bill has been submitted to the State to index social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account rising prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rumian, a member of the Russian Fair Russia, also suggests that the pensions should be further indexed on 1 April if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of rising prices for goods and services.
Social pensions are indexed annually as of 1 April, in accordance with existing legislation, taking into account the rate of increase in the pensioner ' s subsistence level in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced into the lower chamber provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation, however, is carried out on 1 February and the second one is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA declared Mogerini not to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the European Union's Supreme Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogerini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Canerva, declared that sanctions against legislators participating in the Assembly's activities should not be tolerated.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to the TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, have been collected in support of the Canerva position.
"And there was enough strong support," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures from deputies who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were unacceptable.
In particular, Kovalev stated that Kanerva had promised to raise the problem to the level of EU leadership and to "end the relevant petition."
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone south of Green Cape Island is 60 per cent
The broad low-pressure front of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern end of the Green Cape Islands is likely to be 60 per cent tropical cyclone within 48 hours, reported on Tuesday at the US National Hurricane Center.
Another clearly defined area of low pressure around the middle between the Green Cape and the Lesser Antilles also has 60 per cent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that helped European-country refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used a non-character ' s personal approach by announcing a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement, one of the leaders, Google Rita Masood, who ran with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on questionable trains and buses, we were hungry, thirsty, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has increased, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
The donations will be transferred to four non-profit organizations assisting refugees and migrants: Médecins sans frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the sum on the google.com/refugeerde relief page reached $11 million.
Europe has been confronting the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with small obesity can help in obesity surgery
The beneficial effect of a surgery of obesity in people with small obesity with 2-type diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to say that diabetes with small obesity lives longer after obesity surgery than those receiving unsurgery treatment.
"The death statistics are not immediately apparent," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Ignition surgeons, or bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of the organs to eat.
In a number of years, baratric surgery has proved effective for the treatment of diabetes of type 2, but basic research has been carried out among people with morphine obesity with a body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
The IMT, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered to be normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight, and persons with IMTs above 30 are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Min-Shang General Hospital of Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach and sleeve gastroectomy - with 2-type diabetes treatments for people with small obesity.
The average value of IMTs for surgical interventions fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMTs remain at approximately 29 for those who have received non-surgery treatment for diabetes.
Of those who suffered the surgery, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent partially.
In the group that received medication, for comparison, only 1% of the total diabetes treatment was observed, and only about 2% of the total is observed.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LPN cholesterol "in general were better in a surgical group," the authors claim.
Researchers also controlled levels of hemoglobin A1s in blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, written by researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8 per cent.
But the best glycomic control indicators reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo ' s research manager and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to a group that had crawled with a sleeve gastroectomy, the tunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a higher decline in IMTs (7.4 per cent versus 5.1 per cent) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent), and was closer to full diabetes remission (46.9 per cent compared to 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden that surgical treatment actually increases life expectancy, as reported by Blackstone of the Finnish College of Medicine, Arizona University.
According to a Swedish study of obesity, the probability of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than for a group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with IMTs below 35 who were interested in such a procedure.
"This report is very important because it states that such surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient's IMT reaches a range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
I think it's very difficult to reverse the genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies.
There were 9 million rubles taken out of the house by the robbers in the Mitts.
There were 9 million rubles and three women ' s jokes that had been attacked and stolen by the inhabitants of the sub-smoker house in the Watts.
Interfax is informed by reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people, through an open front door, entered a house on Gorkogo Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three jokes.
Preliminary data indicate that the amount of damage was 9 million roubles and that criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading "Rashboy."
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 Berterburg Hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the football World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are not yet in a hurry to obtain permission.
According to the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world dominance, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to disperse all the city's guests.
The Rosbalt interviewees believe that the tournament will raise the rental cost of the rented flats by 10 to 30 per cent, and will have to be overpaid after the demountable housing championship.
The football World Championship made the authorities pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law specifically written under the front line, every hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is now clear that it will not be possible for all of us to do so: the hotels are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS, Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has examined 138 hotels and is now planning 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopolitans.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies has deceived the city by placing a number of stars in advertising, noting Vladimirov.
The problem is, now there's literally every number in the account, no one can be lost before 2018.
They suspect that during the football championship, the fans will take all the Berterburg hotels.
There are currently 305,000 tourist numbers in the city.
According to Smolny, 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gwichia, the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, only 23 hotels have been classified so far - so many checks have been carried out by companies accredited to Petersburg.
And if any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, it is not known that it is surprising to follow the circumstances.
I mean, there may be more classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of the hotels did not want to be classified," acknowledged by the Director of the North-West Branch of the Russian Union of the Ekaterin Shadsky Tour Industry.
This is due to a high season in which hotels earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is that the budgets that did not charge the costs of verification may be applied to the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, the hotel leaders have recently stepped up and started applying for classification, assured Shadsky.
The hotels have to make it until 1 July 2016, or they will not only pay a fine, but they will not be allowed to work for the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on starship, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas for which value will be calculated will be published next year.
This has been done to prevent a 200-300 per cent price escalation, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum, for example.
We need to have a conscience and avoid two or three times a promotion, but the hotels must also be given a living.
"I think growth will be 50%," explained by the President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how well this is within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than an insane value," he pointed out.
It's not clear what's gonna happen with popular cheap tails.
The members of the State Duma have introduced a bill that prohibits hostels in residential homes.
It is very hoped that this law will not be enacted or will not apply to St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the tails must be preserved," Nana Gwachia considers.
However, she said that the owners of mini-owners should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Council approves the bill, about 80 per cent of the hosts will be closed in St. Petersburg, and so far there are 1,500 numbers.
According to President Leonid Garbar of the Federation of Restorators and Hotels of the North-West, there are two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg that are called for by football fans, but there is a distortion towards hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation where 75,000 vips sit at the 80th stadium.
It can be fixed by mini-hotels.
Their possible ban on the expert thinks "idioticism": "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but there's some reason why visitors can't."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if, as a hotel to which guests arrive for a short time, why not?
Mini-gostians are at risk of missing the world's football championship and because of their lack of time.
For hundreds of small hotels, they're just gonna miss the classification, and they're gonna give it to themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all the hotels in the city will be booked for work.
"The companies that may not do so much, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive," noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the checks that have been carried out so far are far higher than the Peterburgh.
The reason for the Peterburg delay is related, inter alia, to the constant reshuffling of the Government ' s tourist block, which does not facilitate smooth work.
According to the experts, if the Berterburg Hotels are not enough, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to regional hotels and recreational houses.
As an example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized in the city, i.e. visitors to the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, many of the fans trained will arrive in the vans where they can sleep.
"I'm sure Gennady Lamshin isn't gonna make enough hotels to let them go."
Demountable housing will also be very popular during football.
Most likely, the city will create a stock of demountable apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"It is obvious that the first place will leave near the stadium," noted the rental specialist of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Studies, Laris Bragin.
The rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We shouldn't forget the human qualities of the citymen.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a welcome city where people not just set the road, but they can also conduct a mini excursion.
There are also complications.
My dad met a family in the yard in 1970 from Murmanska, father, mother and two children.
They didn't have a place to sleep, and it was difficult with hotels, and it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," remembered the interviewer.
True, he added that there was no such feature in the inhabitants of the city now - calling to their homes is a consequence and awful.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of the hotels and governments will have to be remembered.
The Girinian "sleal" of the Amur region.
With admiration today, he looked at the clown of Zhirinovsky in Gosdum.
He did things like that when our generation was just learning how to trade newspapers, and he's still in perfect shape.
The theme of the presentation is, like, "LDPR protest against the results of the Amur elections."
The protocols do not shake, for there is nothing; there are no protocols other than those signed by the barks.
When he raises Ivan Abramov's second place, he screams like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And right now, there's nothing going on in Rodnin, and then, after the attack with the presiding officer, takes the faction out of the conference room, yelling literally, "You're all with the fronts of your bugs and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarches of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfovich was beautifully and elegantly licking the Amur region along with Abramov.
For the country as a whole, this is the next Zhirinsky-style "Poonki" move, not the political party's protest against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has been formally saddled, and the elections, according to the party website and Facebook of Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the subject is obviously getting off the line.
He gives the dead in Amura to bury his dead, and he is the one who blesss the "One Russia" in general and the innocent Rodney.
An elegant decision to keep the face from losing, and to the real, and not the obvious scandal, not to go.
Another thing is that the Abrams themselves are now in a weird situation.
Except for his superiors, he didn't wait for anything, there's no alternative protocol on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other hand, for a narrow circle, he has become the formal cause of insulting the respected championship, and, more importantly, the ham attacks on EP and ONF.
And that's where he really needs to think about what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of the election, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 of the only district single-dantage district, it can become a partnership that successfully used its own party leadership and super-reflector for the ONF itself and the party leadership of someone else.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Girinovsky, it should have come up and watched him with honor.
The tram is still growing up and growing up.
There's news that LDPR will return to the hall during the next film.
I mean, the bath fell at all.
The only thing about Abram was buried underneath.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees by saying Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries of origin.
Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity must be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while it was a matter of admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees - excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions, how to bring true peace and real development, mainly through education, to those Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
In terms of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, stating that the United States' tough reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand-infection device over the past four years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who had swallowed a high alcohol disinfection device, as reported by Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gailord López, Director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the cases of children selling up to 12 years of hand disinfection fluids reported to the toxicology centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more contact with these substances, and unfortunately some percent of them go to the emergency room," explained López CNN.
He said that some children were drinking disinfecting fluid specifically, and some were doing it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
The YouTube video shows that teenagers drink disinfecting fluid as cheap drinks.
Teenagers were reportedly mixing disinfectant fluids with alcohol-containing fluids to strip their mouths in order to get a stronger drink.
Younger children can attract pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
"The baby doesn't think it's gonna hurt him," said López.
Many of the most retractors (defecting fluids for hands) are those that are aromatic.
There are disinfectant fluids for the hands of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The disinfecting liquid for the hand contains about 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
Small children, especially a few sprays, can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol," told Fox 4 at Kansas City Dr. Stephen Thornton, the chief doctor of the toxicology centre at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a whiskey bag, but people are keeping these hand disinfectants in sight, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a disinfectant for some four scents of strawberry, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett health centre near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and couldn't walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was really scary," told CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could well have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-pants or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfecting fluids for their hands from the children ' s reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not an etilium alcohol, which was identified as a substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in the north of New York conspired to poison them to a "inverse" teacher by "dissemination of anti-bakterial substances in the classroom" according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy on hand deinfectors, and she banned them from keeping them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was a "suspicious conversation" and addresses the discipline of the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the northern N.K. Children ' s Library, the Krupsky Gruci is saddled by a cunning owl.
The babies who come after the books are trying to feed her candy.
A few generations have gone to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twentieth century had loud readings here, performed plays on the verses of Mayakovsky, conducted literary quiz and rewritten with Lenin's wife.
The census lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Jewish Steel" wrote in 1939, "the friendship between Nadde Konstantin Krupa and friends of Barnaula's children's library" became stronger every day.
Constantinovna's hope even sent out a far-reaching Barnaulian friend her childhood picture.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadej Konstantin didn't mind giving her name to the library, she said no, I don't mind.
The letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and nobles of the first readers have to explain whose hard profile is adorning the barelef in the library building.
During the restructuring years, people often called, and they resented: Why doesn't the children's library rewrite?
Let there be a library of the name of a good child writer, without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Krupsky" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaula, like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby, a yellow brick track.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite subject of the artist Olly Moskovka.
Ola used to be the manager of the law firm, came to work at eight, went out at five, and only love for painting was different from all the other managers.
And then I found an announcement on the Internet: "A book illustriator is required."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Ola made illustrations, and I thought life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the children's books of writers all over the world and makes stories.
Traditionally, children are considered to lose interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But reading children are coming to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says "Russian planet" by the director of Tatiana Kusweed Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and she's gonna live, the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby, the library hangs a big exhibition with an updated photoexposition.
Once a quarter, new pictures of readers who go to the library of the whole family - Mom, Dad and the children - are displayed.
The library is glad that dads have become more and more frequent with children.
If two years old a child was read to the entire Chukovsky, he needs more books at his older age.
But now there's a law that prohibits eight years of uniform industry from issuing 12+ books.
In order to obtain such a book, the child must bring his or her parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually the Group becomes something like a family club for them.
There's treasure in the library - the prerevolutionary collection was made with huts and rats, and the Kingenko in an annex to the magazine "Niva," a 1936 Murzilki pod.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book's frame, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can come to read, play, paint.
We've made a playground for the kids -- a kid just comes to play, and a hand still sticks to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they stick with their feet, they don't want to leave.
It's a lot of times that moms come in and we're glad they put the library first among all the other places to come with the babysitters.
Tatiana Kusweed says today's children like we once love classical childhood literature:
"The publishing business is now evolving, and much attention is paid to authors who are the inter-generational link."
And speaking of little kids, it's important for them to be some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The Library regularly publishes booklets for parents who describe what is happening in modern child literature, which books are worth looking at and why.
The books are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is forbidden to remove books outside the reading room by adults.
This magic privilege only has children.
...The library's longest room has a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, a bookstore.
The steps will be violined under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend: hey, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie's still walking on the road with a yellow brick, the tapes of Tol Rizkov stealing magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchisch never told the goddamn military Tina burries - that's his firm word.
Books like passwords can be found anywhere.
There are in the vault and real book rares - for example, the pre-revolutionary compilation was with the mugs and the rats.
Or take Korolenko in a famous annex to the Niva magazine.
Or a 1936 Murzilki pillow.
Time's older pages, painted them in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming of retirement, and I'm gonna do rare children's books.
But the kids are not gonna do it anymore, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the topics are... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the cosmol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this "Pioner Truth?"
But it was still interesting, " says the Russian planet, "Galina Ilasova, the head of the book storehouse.
The Murzilki lines are dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna is running a bookstore all his life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, in which school year Harry Potter became captain of Griffindor's team at the Quidwich Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the engine silencer, and who Alice Seleseva's father works.
The librarian's work is not paid much, and everyone who can live without these book series finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced ones remain: educators, educators, ministers of the book.
They can also be found in a smile - it is considered to be a professional feature of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I love children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be just and beautiful on the shelf, and I also love to read them, "Galina Vasilievna says.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fantastic.
I read modern Russian writers, fresh translations...
Of course, I think things were different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sat and read.
I hope that the books will always be in spite of the legislators.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children or grandchildren...
Rumour mill: There's no disagreement in Seltica.
Griffiths denied talking about differences in the Zelica after Deila's confession that Hoops was in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt team unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Seltic" to five points.
Penalty Adam Rooney in the first time gave Aberdin a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittordri, which allowed Dons to break down from Celica by five points.
Griffiths denied talking about differences.
This led to rumors of disagreements in the Seltica, which were interrupted by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling tense, I think the players are looking for him.
The Dutch are boring because the Scottish aren't in the title fight - de Bur.
A former semi-defendant from Rangers and a former member of the Netherlands team, Ronald de Bur, said that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Seltica because he was not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ayax, said: "In Holland, no longer shows the most attractive moments of the "Seltic" game, why?"
It's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about Ringers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the old firm games, and not just people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted "Seltic" was in trouble, but Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
The fall from Malmyo and, as a result, the exit from the Champion League was soon followed by the loser of 10 Aberdin footballers, who now, after five points, took the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, "Selitka has been in bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really need the support of Seltica, because it makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warberton is waiting for the January transfers with mistrust.
Despite the opinions that appeared just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, Mark Warberton's Rangers' boss was suspicious of the January campaign, arguing that he did not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former Brentford attacker said, "The Yanvarian transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players that come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu, who's interested in "Seltic," hinted about the completion of his career.
The attacker, Swansi, Mich, connected to Seltic during the transfer window, implied that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans was over.
A 29-year-old player suffered from an ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to stand up to SFA about Nelson's statements.
"Harts" was held with an account of 2:1 when Paterson was removed and played 3:2, but the red card of counsel was later cancelled; it was the third red card of Collum cancelled in eight months.
Nelson doesn't give up his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasle.
Hybernan's stubborn player got a reprimand after he admitted to singing a song with offensive words about the former "Harts" player, Rudy Scacell.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh derby in Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was burning, " said the attacker, adding, "I can safely say that I wasn't going back to Tinkasle if he doesn't play for Seltic.
Donnelly: Tannadis's council is confident in Dundy United's management.
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dandy United remains confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad that "unbeautiful" won from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdin team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive victory in the league, which put them five points above Celica, up the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runey's penlatty in the first time.
McInness said, "There's no team here to win anything, a cup, or a league champion who didn't win meetings like this."
The unemployment rate among the Scottish population has not changed, whereas in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing.
IN Scotland, the total number of unemployed persons in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (NSO).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with a current employment of 2,612,000.
Scotland ' s employment rate declined from 74.0 per cent to 74.0 per cent, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Minister of Scotland, David Mandela, commented on the most recent figures, said: "The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution of Oklahoma?
Today, while avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit on the watch gallery of the death row in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed with lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As I approach this day, I became afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell you the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and because they often want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press places was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be a witness and journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to take the notebook and pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter of being impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she'd be better at it, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he told me.
I told him he could get me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not gonna go into detail here again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glassip isn't responsible.
His actions after Barry van Treez's murder make him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a high probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this angle, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be asked to do so.
You'll know what it's like to watch the person I like die without need.
The person under investigation by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River
Constable from Canning Valley City managed to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Pert's resident intended to leave the police, but he couldn't get stuck in the dirty water on a small league a few metres from a police officer trying to "slightly convince him to go to the shore."
Cunning Vail police were summoned on Tuesday on the illegal entry into another territory in Bakkingham.
When the cops noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them by leaving for Cunning.
But he didn't sail far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's grab me," said Sergeant Chandel Castledine.
Constable Laclan Perhavez didn't really want to wash his uniform, so he used a safer reception, "negotiation with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do weird things to try to escape," says Sergeant Castledine.
That's what Ben Cousins' Football Champion remembers.
In 2006, Cousins moved into a curvature to avoid meeting a police patrol to check on alcohol, and tried to sail Swan.
His efforts have been in vain, but the locals have been forced to invent a joke "beatlon Ben Kazins."
Peter Moody is accusing the stewards of trying to spy and threatening to leave the stable sport.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's stewards of trying to put a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave a stable sport immediately.
He was targeted by the stewards and staff of the Ethics Department Racing Victoria, whom he accused of having launched a campaign against him personally, and the removal from the start of Lady Tatai, due to the violation of the rules on the use of drugs on the day of start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort by participating in the races, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on suspicion of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't gonna talk about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it beats you out of the barn so much that you're not holding back anymore," Mudy said.
They know it continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm gonna sleep tight.
I want to walk with a high head raised, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not like that, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'm gonna have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody was previously sensational when he interviewed for racing.com, that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stable.
"A year and a year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with the man I'm gonna call if they ask, and offered him a job in my stable to give him information about what I'm doing in my stables," Mudy said on Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they all should certainly file applications, as the attempt to catch me has not succeeded.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, external executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and knew it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't the RVL be brave enough to be held accountable for what's going on in this business for people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people in there think it's true.
Maybe they should take my license away and push me away, and I'm sure what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
I'm really sad about it.
I'll put pressure on them and hold them responsible for making a decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The trainer's siege only increased during a long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari cases, and the last removal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could "smart his license to the table."
Moody, the most famous of all, who prepared Black Caviar's invincible championship, described the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the "smoking" competition after the horse's feet had been accompanied from clay, which constituted a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on the swings.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees, by mistake, made her a leg-compress.
She could have received a compression last night.
She could have had it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the compress competition, on which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it went too far," said Moody.
The driver who carried out the raid and escaped from the Kobram incident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter with serious injuries after he was hit by a car at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help the wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia town surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, 40-year-old Cobrama, remains in a stable hospital.
Melburn Storm Coach Craig Bellami's competing charges for use of hard power gear.
Coach Melburn Storm, Craig Bellami, called the criticism of the ball's interception by his team as the "coupling of the agenda" by two favorites of the NRL championship.
Trent Robinson, the Coach of Sidney Rusters, stated that the judges allowed Storm to fight with his team during the sudden victory of Storma in the finals of the qualification game in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbane Broncos" Wayne Bennett made a clear hint of "Storm" after his team won the final of the qualification tournament at "Nozern Queensland Caubies" on Saturday night, when he called this game "model" for the rugby league and said that two of the Queensland team weren't "so successful" in the hand-held grip.
Bellami defended the ball with his team and said they were just focusing on "contakte" by intercepting the ball.
Bellami added that he was convinced of the criticism of his team by two leading coaches, which meant that they were concerned about possible defeat from Storm.
"It keeps coming up, "I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about tough receptions when they played us at 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques in a year, just in the last six weeks, we've focused on contacts when we intercept the ball, and this has become a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's kind of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of "incriminating football," reminding his teacher that "St. George-Ilawarra Dragons" Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing boring football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night to our Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was." He noticed Bellamy.
I remember a lot of criticisms in 2010 called the boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care at all.
But now he's got a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young half-defendants at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have such players.
He made that comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two half-defendant like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play it like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellami also noted that the game "Storma" and "Rusters" was a contest with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Cauboises."
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, he was at 8:18, there were two more attempts - and what, that's impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet with them there.
At Storm's end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to take either North Queensland Caubies or Cronalla Sharkes on the next Saturday night at the AAMI Park stadium, the tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
The accused of possession of drugs was released on bail at $200,000.
A man at risk of life imprisonment for trying to extract 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maximović, 29 years old, one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, moving from South America through Vanuatu and docking in Cumera in August.
During the morning, Maximović and his associates were seen at the dock, and later he met with them at the Comera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maximović faces a life sentence for attempting to assign sufficient quantities of narcotic drugs for sale, Maximović ' s counsel claims that there is no evidence that the latter attempted to obtain the entire party, and that the man could have been in a cafe without any intent.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court doubted that Maximović should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and the father of Maximović were asked to pay a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
"It becomes clear from both accounts that the amount of the bond of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan observed.
But one of those measures was not enough to guarantee that he would not disappear, but the judge added it.
Maximović was allowed bail on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passport to the police daily and observe curfews from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Fotis Katicaris: "I'm proud of Greece's team that fought until the last seconds."
The chief coach of Greece's team, Fotis Katicaris, paid tribute to his team after match 1/4 Eurobasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game has made some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Katicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
We tried to work in defense, but the defense error determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In the CSCA, I will be assigned the functions of Kauna."
CSA's new girl Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win Eurolig in the next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quote "R-Sport" Freeland. "In fact, I will be assigned the functions of Sasha Kauna, who has left the team, both in the defence buildings and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to remodel to the position of the center, but I'm gonna play more forward at the NBA.
Now it's gonna have to be more against the big center rival, but I've done it before, so I think I can do it now.
The army last won Eurolig in 2008.
Since then, they've been getting to Finala Four six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling the team's been snapped.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win Eurolig, I really think.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moskviks have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSCA's year.
As for the glitter, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination if you connect these two things, it's all possible.
I don't have any particular rituals before the games, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, the match with Rome will be special."
The main coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first tour of the Champion League Group Tour with Rome with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his current and former team will not be a regular match for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained "wolves" in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show himself on the best side in Italy's capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, which has gained some experience.
I have very warm memories with Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start a championship game from winning.
The August meeting at Joan Gamper's Cup will not affect the team's action in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the Rome game that she showed in series A against "Juventus."
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has different options for attacking.
The Officer-in-Charge of Urala, Vadim Scripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th tour of the Prime League with Krasnodar, noted the diversity of attack schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, "beans" have several models of assault in their arsenal.
The fight will take place on 21 September and begin at 4.30 p.m. Moscow time.
As we play with the Krasnodar, let's see, it's an official website called Urala.
We've got a whole training week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attack, multiple attacks, while we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is playing the League of Europe's game against the Dortmund "Borussia," we'll try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Ama "Astana" can take the glasses away from anyone."
A half-man of Astana Roher Kanyas after the first tour of the League of Champions Group Tournament with Benfika (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team in the future.
According to Hawbek, the Ottomans are able to remove the glasses from any rival on their field.
Even though the match has been hard for us, I can say we played well - the official UEFA website uses Kanyas' words.
Binky is higher than class, but in a home match, I think we can count on taking their glasses away.
It's quite real.
But first we need to think about "Galatasara" and then "Atletiko."
In domestic matches, we can take the glasses away from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll tell you as many times as possible: Cristian Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, the chief coach of the Reala, expressed satisfaction with the major victory in the first round of the League of Champions Group Tour with Shahter (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Forward Kristian Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
The match wasn't easy because Shahter knows how to own the ball, says the official UEFA website Benites.
The rival hadn't had many moments, but their counterattacks always put them at risk.
I'm not saying that Real was perfect, but we had plenty of golf opportunities.
I'm pleased we didn't miss the ball and hit four.
Krishtian Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it every time I want.
Lordy Alba: "Cristian Ronald can't compare with Messie."
The Barcelons Protector, George Alba, thinks that no one can compare with his one-man Lionel Messie.
According to the Spaniard, Cristian Ronaldo's "Real" forward can't do that either.
Monsieur five heads above the others, quote Le Figaro Albu.
Even Cristian Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things change, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only unique style but also bright identities.
A half-man of Rome, Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the game of a group tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactity and insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
We'll remind you, "CE" will broadcast her text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, quote the official UEFA de Rossi website.
It's hard to play with blue-granatas because they have not only unique style but also bright identities.
To keep them, we're gonna have to smell all over the game and keep each other safe.
Messies are almost always successful when they go into the flood, so we need to remain compact and organized.
Jesov hopes to get out of the SKA startup in a match with Slovan.
The Golkipper of SKA Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hoped to be in the army's startup in the next game of the KKL Championship.
Jesov went to ice instead of Micco Koskinen on 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his gate, the fourth star of SKA missed after replacing the gate with the sixth field player.
The next team match will be on the way against Slovana.
I hope to go out in the next game in the start-up, "R-Sport" tells you the words of Jezhov.
I'm not an expert at the gate, I'm the gatekeeper, we don't show the protruding heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team's lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Stevean Hogg used the girl's phone to get paedophiles to send photos.
Pedophil used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet transmission service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone missing and found it in Hogg's sleeper's hand.
She checked it and found shocking pictures, and immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at this address and found "relevant" requests in the search system using words to detect the indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the cops that he did it because it could be "to attract pedophiles" and then he would" pretend he was a cop to scare them."
C.O.E.E.E. Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dandy: "He said it was addiction, and he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted he was asking for a computer, but he said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare paedophiles.
He was interviewed about talking to an unknown person who sent him images and asking him to send more pictures.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found pictures on her phone, she called her mother, was shaking and crying.
She saw indecent images on her phone, and then the defendant was held a hard rate.
The girl was questioned and reported that the accused had used a computer and a Playstone to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dandy, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the terms of bail on 25 January this year and not appearing before a hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant ' s counsel, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be listed as having committed sexual offences, as it could be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October until he received a social service certificate.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody prior to the hearing on other remaining cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of his conviction.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest government leader of Africa, fell earlier this year from the front-end ladder.
He wasn't hurt, but a video of the fall scene spread rapidly across social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opposition leaders that they had received anonymous threats warning them against Mugabe ' s obsolescence during the presentation of the appeal.
A month ago, they blamed the President on his appeal to the nation in Parliament; that was exactly what Mugabe said on Tuesday.
Member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innosent Gonese, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe ' s speech.
"The message came from a number that was not displayed, but it was entitled "Death," he informed journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned Parliament members that immunity ends in the Parliament building and, once they leave, parliamentary inviolability does not operate.
A member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was concerned about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme of restructuring and cost reduction in service delivery.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly evolving hardware and service sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard now, and the portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technological solutions" to companies, reported in the company's application.
The company formed in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, for the production of electrical equipment, called their garage in Palo Alto "the place of birth of the Kremlin Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in a major reorganization process to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world's second world personal computer producer and one of the largest U.S. technical companies, is the latest development in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Captain Arsenala Michael Arteta says that his one-capulars should support traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing "Dinamo Zagreb"
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that only September was yet, and that if Wilshire's recovery was to go according to plan, he would have nothing to stop him from going back to the game by Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European championship next summer remains in question.
The most unfortunate thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire was sure to finish the previous season with the only trauma of an ankle and was about to return to the typical aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with an ankles or injuries he's had before.
This may be medically related things, but as Wenger also let go, there is a risk of additional trauma for any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that occurred to him in six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenala games in the league during the last five seasons.
Looking more broadly at Arsenal's base, six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Prime League clubs that had the most missing days due to injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the probability of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenale believes that improvements in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"When you get back to bed after the injury, you've been vulnerable for some time, "you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage" said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure of it, just like his career will be the one he deserves.
The Arsenal is starting a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb, and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hawtspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Hector Belierin and Aaron Ramsey didn't come to Croatia, so it's likely that Mathieu Debushi and Artita will be playing in the start-up.
Wenger may also join Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Jiro instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little break to those players who need it," told Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a frivolous favourite in group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among the most dismal in Europe.
Dinamo hasn't lost any of the 41 matches since they did last season as "Unbelievable."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-point earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned a lesson from last season when the team defeated the game of the League of Champions from Monaco, and remains with little hope of bringing the club to victory in the finals of the Champions Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with an internship.
We have ambition, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious male friendship lessons
The absence of such stories is being blinded, especially given the desperate need for men to be frank, now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men is as high as 15 years old.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death among men between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an attempt to address the issue of "Campia against the Poor," the year 2015 was declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression revealed that if a patient has a large number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of healing are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends is reducing the chance of mental disorders by half.
But, of course, to make friendship work, first of all, we need her to be.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, where style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality is so lonely.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, imaginary, social status, entirely at the expense of domestic values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently observed, a video game maker, you're not gonna buy any more happiness for money.
The virtue of the Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each character was not defined through his work, but rather through a person who was in contact with his friends.
Yumore Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' rehearsals on Rachel, all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As Samaritance said to me, "my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal sentiment highlights how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often, those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old "living with it" teaching is strong, just like the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer working coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the small moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of outside telephone conversation helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from the family's neighboring circle and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where for the holiday you completely restored the decorations, why not take your friends to Central Park.
Or even better, if you see a lonely man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
It's too early to guess what good friendship can do.
The Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end of the 236 series, all of them, in the Tague #FriendsFest
D. Maria's gonna kill the goal by helping the SCW destroy Malmyo.
Angel de Maria, on the same footing as Bles Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the full-blown balls at the Malmyo Gate.
Angel de Maria, debuting in the League of Champions, scored a goal that allowed the SCW to easily bypass Malmyo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kavani did their job when Pari St. Germen started his game in the Champion League with a very convenient 2-0 victory against Malmyo at Park de Prens Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Champions as a player of the SCW to direct the champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Kavani scored the goal for the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donet Shahter in Group A, Pari needed to take a good start against Sweden's champions, as they did not target playoffs, but rather to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached quarter-finals.
They earned their glasses, but at the same time it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to count Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and later to replace him with a field in the game against a team from his hometown and club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or guests in the Champion League, so win the score of 2:0, deliver problems to rivals and play well in defense is a good start, even if there are other moments that we're gonna need to work through the season," said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I'm sorry we didn't hit one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after the injury in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her a 2-2 in the Bordo match in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the back of Dee Maria for a fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was seen as a player who could take the SCW to a new level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran to pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmyo's protection and had made a beautiful attack by sending the ball by Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected a light and big victory from the SCW then, they had to disappoint.
Malmyo, who defeated Seltic in playoffs to get to this stage, with nine world-level players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two proximate semi-defendants in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicola Jurgić's strike, where the ball flew past the far-fetched Kevin Trapp gate for the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
However, the SCW sometimes caused itself to fail in the transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who was only unable to carry out at least five attempts in the first half, and then failed to process the ball that was beaten by Kavani as soon as the game resumed.
However, he showed himself much more capable in the exact passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who received, De Maria sent the ball with a twisted blow that had been pulled to the pin by Vilanda for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally beaten after a clock mark, thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich planted the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had about returning to the game, and only the interception of Viland's ball at close range prevented David Luis from increasing the final account before the replacement Esquiel Lavessi had been counted naked at the very end of the game.
The Malme coach, Age Haraid, later admitted that PSG was a class higher than his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was held last December."
Since then, we've only played Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Pari's glory!
It was a wonderful match with them.

The BMW vehicle, which was driven by Mirzoev, crossed the lane and hit a motorcycle parked on the side of the road.
The man of 1989 died at the scene of his injuries.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at a high speed before the accident to the counterway.

The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will take place in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, with the participation of a Tunisian delegation headed by the Governor.
The upcoming Sochi event and the interim outcome of cooperation are described by the Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Shugl, who served as the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions - important links between the two States.
The plenary meeting is scheduled to be attended by President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus.
In the framework of plenary and breakout sessions, the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, regulations and programmes of the Federal State will be discussed.
The forum will be addressed by the Governor of the Tumen region.
I believe that this shows successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present at the Forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be available.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new favourable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a meeting of a permanent seminar in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tumeni.
In addition, the delegation of APC in the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in agricultural training, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
Recently, you met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakushev was talking about the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be addressed - they need to reduce the cost of end-user machines.
Problems were discussed in the work of Belshin ' s Tumen Trade House and options for preventing loss.
Issues of importance, since investment projects must work clearly and generate profits for the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of IAZ ' s passenger and cargo equipment to the JAO, the development of the IAZ ' s service centre, which was established at the Tümeni base of the TATAP.
The discussion also involved the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of this year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation in the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to move to a new level.
The regional centre also dealt with these issues.
During a meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tumeni, Alexander Moor, we talked about the upgrading of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing for lada, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required to work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the Oilfleftmash OAO, receiving kits.
In my view, these activities could become more active, given the installation programmes for new elevators in the district centre.
I would like to add that, under the expanded powers of the Consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alekse Kocorin, during which the issue of increasing the turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaire was discussed.
A meeting with the Omani Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tumen can be described as a county headquarters.
The region is a site for many promising projects, including the work of honorary genncula.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in terms of how many problems can be addressed directly and quickly, reducing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to destroy the fabric by continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is opposed to focusing on the ethnic diversity of people employed in film production.
Matt Damon argued with Effy Brown, the producer of the African American, saying that he didn't need to take into account ethnic composition.
During the Sunday launch of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black hero in the draft scenario.
"A variety is appropriate when you're casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
In order to discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Afflec and the Farelli brothers.
"I'd like participants - no matter who's the director - to think about how they're going to stick to the image of Harmony," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who beats a white pimp.
Dear White People's film producer advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brankccho to be film directors; Damon was in stark opposition to saying that "we can eventually get the wrong thing."
After the discussion had been shown on television, social media had been blown up by inappropriate comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "A clarification of the diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room of TACO BELOE, which is painful."
Tweet's got over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "Likes."
Damon ' s remarks appear precisely when the literacy coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot dead by a policeman in 2014, Black Lives Matter was popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the coloured population.
In February, Prince's singer mentioned this movement during the presentation of the year's Albom nominations at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued a formal statement in response to a question from Fox News official, Elizabeth Hasselbek, on whether the group would be considered a group of haters.
"Black Lives Matter is a group of love," reported by the leaders of the movement.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business, producers and media agents invited to visit the Pope of Rome to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation or whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" wins the first champion.
The professional sarolazz and the assistant waiter, Isaac Caldiero, became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home the prize of $1 million.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have been able to pass all stages of the road with obstacles.
In the final season, two participants, Caldiero, and Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a rope climb of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the mission first and set up at the time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, which was a very severe phase 4, but Caldiero did the task for three seconds faster, making it a winner.
After a win with unbelievable work, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview "E!News."
"Thinking about it is incredible, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," commented Isaac to journalists E!
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it happened... there's no future.
The executive producer, Kent Wade, met with the journalists "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, won't get any cash prize.
According to the rules, the money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the philanthropists are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He's happy about what he did.
He got a ton of fan feedback.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed our roles.
The "American Ninja Warrior" show will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" is quiet around "Minnesot Twins."
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, Tygers is now the last in the Central Division of the American League.
Just to be an obstacle, Tygers won a blitz on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 outcome on "Targetfield."
Twins missed a chance to cut half a game behind Houston Astros and take second place in playoffs by number of points after the winners.
For the detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they get out," reported by the Tygers manager Brad Osmus.
The Tigers Pitcher Alfredo Simon made a contribution in support of the attacks, which resulted in Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, and then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pet at 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish a year with good figures," said Simon.
Petchers can't be replaced in every game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, the target of the Taigers, has been able to take three hits and has sustained two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Marines on 6 July.
"He worked well in battle," said Osmus.
He has shown himself well in (the Batter's skills), which is clearly better in the work of the battle, and he has kept it a quality for the game.
After three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance of getting back to the game.
The central host of Byron Baxton opened an inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks took over the first base, and the second baseman Brian Dozier received a strike-out from Simon before he took over the left of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked through Moira, the only player on the way, earlier than the new target of beating Miguel Sano, who beat the two-ranned Single to the left of the right-wing Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of ranners not in an outboard and comparing wound on Verhagen's second base, it was possible to bring Trevor Pluff's third baseman to a double-plea.
It was the 27th time for the top league player in this season when Pluff kicked the ball on the double-player.
After Detroit added an insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer made the RBI "Dable" into the space between autfielders against the closing puppy "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the right-wing player beat Sano after three strikers and got his fifth Sewer.
Detroit took advantage of a temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tygers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved petcher, who was on the list of injured before the game, missing more than a month due to lumbar inflammation.
"Definitely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game evolves, I felt more comfortable and so I could do some pretty good throws in third inning."
After the first batter got to base one, Hughes dropped the single of second baseman Ian Keinsler.
Woook, at two auts of Reitfielder J. D. Martínez, took Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with the ranners in a successful position.
The third base game, Nick Castellanos, was followed by "single," bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to approach the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
"Tigers" increased the score in the second inning by getting a one-way "dable" from a Catcher James McCann and a two-a-way "single" of the central beating Anthony Goose, which was 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager of "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got right into the right point.
Hughes, whose brooks were considered, threw a third inning in the missing glasses, after which he was replaced by a right-wing river, A. J. Ahter.
Hughes counted three wounds on six hits and a four-strike-out woke.
THE Pitcher's "Tigers," Anibal Sanchez, left the players because of the stretching of the right shoulder.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who was doing Sanchez's shoulder surgery as early as 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured since mid-August, is scheduled to be released on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, Daniel Norris's left-wing petrizer will leave the list of injured and go against Twins.
Norris, who had left Taigers at four startups since his purchase in exchange for David Price's league beer on 30 July, has won one victory and one defeat.
He didn't play games since August 20 because of the muscle stretching.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games on Wednesday at the Targretfield.
Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by the Dr. Erwin Santana (54-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov's complaints on the book "Molba to God" came to the South Sahel Court.
In the South Sahel City Court, the original appeal filed by President Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Molba to God: Its meaning and Place in Islam" was submitted by Interfax, citing the President of the Khosud Alexander Chuhrai.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation concerning the need to test the mining authorities for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIL.
"Show yourself a comment on such stupid things," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahel City Prosecutor ' s Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko ' s decision to recognize the book "extremist material."
The South Sahalinska Public Prosecutor ' s Office filed an appeal on Friday night.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, they believe that they asked the court to accept the extremist opinion only of the author of the book, not of the verses of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chuhrai reported.
The decision to recognize the book "extremist material" was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were quoted from the Koran, saying, "We worship you and we pray for help," "Do not call upon anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision-makers "seytans and wirers."
He called on the deputies of the State to prohibit by law judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
"I firmly believe that the State must adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions concerning directly the texts of the Koran and other divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook officials intend to remove posts and comments that provide negative assessments of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illicit content.
The Faisbuka leadership, together with the German Ministry of Justice, intends to combat xenophobia and racism on the network.
For example, on the eve of the day, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, stated that the ministrous was currently working with social media professionals to establish a special group of moderators.
Participants are obliged to monitor and remove irregular comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the non-Tolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their records.
Organizations with expertise in collecting complaints from social media users about abusive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content.
The Facebook leadership intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after xenophobic attitudes had increased dramatically in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that affected the EU countries some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all sites for refugee accommodation are now overcrowded.
On the eve, the country ' s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Bouchenwald concentration camp.
The displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks, where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation zones in Moscow Cemeteries.
In the near future, several capital graveyards will be equipped with specialized areas for recreation and psychological rest.
The first will be the Boutov, Domodedovsky, and the Shierbian cemetery.
The first psychological rest zone has already appeared at the Troekurov Cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will continue to occur in other parts of the city.
The M24.ru portal was briefed by Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State Budget Institution, Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas that resemble parks.
According to the specialists, in such "headholes" visitors can rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, the relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsky, Boutov and Shierbian cemeteries and then elsewhere in the capital.
According to the head of the GBU, Ritual, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, builders will try to preserve existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
Green plants will serve as a living fence that separates the rest areas and areas immediately placed under the burial site.
The Ritual GBU experts also indicated their intention to make a proposal to remove the fences from the graves.
New cemeteries can really become non-barriers.
In addition, the Ritual GBU reported that it was ready to install electronic terminals that would enable visitors to learn GPS coordinates and numbers of graves.
In June this year, the Ritual GBU also proposed that the cost of disposal services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
Okay, digging graves in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the earth is cold.
It will be noted that in the past year, the cost of all ritual services has averaged 10 per cent.
Five days later, an erring fungus was found in the Lenin forest.
An elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without provision.
It was the joint effort of rescuers and volunteers to discover the herbs.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old retired from the Tambovsky region spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
He was sought by relatives, rescue workers, volunteers.
There were even movies with dogs, but there was no result.
A man was found after a helicopter was involved in search work.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to get his heels and pancakes, but he didn't come back by the evening.
The relatives immediately sought help, and the following day, rescuers and unattractive residents from a nearby village - only about 30 people - were raised to search for the fungi.
A helicopter from the fire and rescue centre joined them for the fifth day.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen County Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "Vertolet has been involved, man has been discovered."
He's gone very far, completely somewhere else.
It was about 12 kilometres from the search site.
He went through a huge distance at his age.
The miracle remained alive.
Gribnick was taken to the Lenin central district hospital unconscious, in extremely difficult condition.
He was diagnosed with pneumonia and severe dehydration and cooling.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days spent in the woods, doctors have no idea.
Valentine Nepsha, who is the head of the medical department of the Lennin CRS: "A patient's examination, treatment."
Infusion therapy, anti-bakterial.
Given all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition has improved in the morning, but remains heavy, but with positive dynamics.
The pensioner, Vitaly Alexandrovich, travels every year to Smolenchin, from the Tambov region.
His grandson says grandpa used to go pick up mushrooms, but he never went deep in the woods.
Alexei Spitschenko, the grandson of the fungus found, said: "Les are near the road, not in principle local."
Literally for a few years, he came to visit, to visit his family.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
Must have gone far and lost.
With the onset of the fungus season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In the past few days alone, five similar cases.
Savers recall that there is a need to walk in the woods in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to keep tracks so that they can return.
Emergency An-2 sat on a leak in a brotherly secret.
He sat in Siberia on a runway with an A-2 accident.
An aircraft from the Red Air Company Enisei made an emergency landing 68 kilometres from Brasska.
There are no dead or injured, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage when landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
There were three crew members on board, a commander, a second pilot and a side mechanic, reporting to Interfax.
An emergency flight took place along the Ironnork-Ilymsk-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The aircraft's crew has already been delivered to Brask.
The Brother ' s Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, has begun to verify compliance with the aviation safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office left at the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew planted its aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction in the abandoned storage airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics were denied on the plane, but the crew made impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
Maintain the Nobel Laureate's Economy: Globalization
The globalization processes should have helped to reduce global inequality.
In fact, the situation is different, the income gap in developing economies is increasing.
Eric Maskin.
To remedy this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, considered by the Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the IDU of the World Health Organization, Nobel Prize winner of the 2007 economy, Eric Maskin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
The supporters of globalization have projected great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have been largely fulfilled," stresses Maskin.
For example, China and India have experienced serious GDP per capita growth.
But it's not so encouraging.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the "poor" and the "poor" in poor countries, which manifests itself in large income inequality and, more specifically, in wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequalities in developing economies" published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by the WEA NEE.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Kramer Eric Maskin, Harvard University, has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization grows, resembles the WEA NEE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries lack skills to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries are growing their wages through co-operatives with B staff from rich ones, then D-employee workers don't feel or their wages fall at all.
The ultimate effect is that internationalization of production will contribute to widening the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thereby increasing inequality.
Kramer and E. Maskine have proposed an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Eritrean theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, " says Fouad Aleskers, a resident professor who is the head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the Department of Mathematics of NIE.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will trigger empirical work in this area.
In Eric Maskin ' s view, the solution is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do so, and companies are not able to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NCOs and private foundations can play a significant role, as Maskin considers it.
The scientist notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produced results in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: Living time connection.
The German, one of Russia's oldest cities, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.

There was a business game to the airport in Domodedoda.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried to be airport staff.
To that end, three air harbour models were installed in Domodedov.
Young people not only examined and recorded passengers, but also served planes.
It's all in the form of a business game, but it's complicated.
The late flights, just two passengers with fractures on board, lost track somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in the Domodedoda hangar, the standard set of tasks to be performed by the newer.
In one hangar, three major airports from around the world were located.
There are four hundred students from capital colleges and universities today.
An unprecedented chance to learn everything about the air harbour's internal world.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance and baggage turnover were entrusted to them even buses on the flight field, trams and passenger searches.
And the passengers are a lot of trouble.
One thing with the paperwork, the other late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to figure this out, like in life, within a minimum period.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if they had been paid by airlines for the maintenance of the voyage.
"For failure to perform their tasks, a fine is sought from them," explains in an interview with the Weste-Mosqua programme, the financial analyst of the Dmitri Hilco game.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this examination is an attempt to test a new form of study.
She's already found a place in secondary vocational education.
"The six interregional centres of competence will be formed, which will in fact become new models of modern colleges with modern management, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment," by the Director of the Department of Public Policy in the area of labour training and additional professional training of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Natal Goldareva.
But students aren't gonna go to global plans.
After three days of training, they're gonna need a day off.
But the grades for this examination were quite material.
Newest smart girls, the best I've ever seen!

The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the United States Centre's Foreign Literature Library.
The Centre has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the American Centre of the Embassy of the United States of America at the M.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the links between Russian and American peoples that were not interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments of the long history of our relations," as stated in the statement made by U.S. Ambassador John Tefft at Interfax.
The American Centre has developed deep and strong links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," stressed the diplomat.
Tefft recalled that, about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX educational exchange programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was an ambulance to the massacre.
Typical situation: four officials are facing Judge Swatanter Kumar's desk, listening to his claims for work.
The Court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make you feel better about it, "Kumar says.
If there's one more brick, we'll tell them to tear down all the structures available.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, which has been accompanied by the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to deal with more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: India has become one of the world ' s most overcrowded and polluted countries in the 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega-polises, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense cane, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and few of the remaining housing areas are cut off under new housing blocks.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the elimination of major investment projects.
For example, in May this year, the Minister of the Environment described the court's decisions as "extreme" and "implemented."
Sometimes the court ' s decisions cannot be executed within the time limit set by the court, confirming the environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, the unimplemented grandfathers also have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," adds a lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled large structures, including the cessation of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also being kept in mind, for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagna, which polluted the local river of the Territory.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," commented on their decision by Kumar.
Such explanations, however, are far from being understood by ordinary people whose lives can be changed by a single stripping of the Jewish pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, rather than causing public outrage.
Despite the sharp popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on incoming and outgoing vehicles, and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, prior to finding out in factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents began to reach the court ' s attention, people ' s anger began to quiet a little.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gang River Cleaning Programme, with the opening of an announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often ceases to control his emotions and goes to scream.
You know what the word "Holy" means?
Someone poured water out of Gang into God's statue and found feces, and the judge is hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is Gang, he'll take all of our sins.
It's a river that we worship, and look what you do to her every day.
The clean-up of Gang is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the standard by more than 120 times.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus who are swimming in it die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Gang Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the costume was bought for $70,000, while at least eight billion was needed to clean the river.
The Green Tribunal's supporters agree that India has a long way to go before it can identify itself as a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as an inexcusable luxury, " says the activist Zov Gang of Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden balance between ecology and development."
The man poured some pictures of Dahli at the Riga exhibition.
A visitor to the Latvian Artists' Union exhibition in Riga broke windows in a museum and spoiled El Salvador Dali's sculpture "The Envelation."
The museum is now hosting an exhibition of the work of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately failed, spoiled the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then began to move around the premises and bleeded several work of permanent display.
Among them is a portrait of Poruka's brush of Mervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobjchin, referred to by Interfax, was also spoiled by whistrins.
There are police and artistic experts at the scene of the incident.

Si Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy must become more open to the world to sustain its growth, as President Xi Jinpin said on Tuesday in his address to the group that faces the challenge of leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness," he said, referring to the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Steering Group on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
He said that increasing openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor market access, changing border controls, encouraging public enterprises (SOEs) that attract private capital and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business law enforcement and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken its control over the powers given to companies, thereby guaranteeing that companies would run their own businesses.
The statement also stated that China would allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to increase local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The Government will not change its foreign investor policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign finance companies as well as provide them with better conditions," as stated in the statement.
In addition, the procedure for applying for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or Green Card, will be facilitated by optimizing requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Kejiang and Ministers Liu Yunchan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
