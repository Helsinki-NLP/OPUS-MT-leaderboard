Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, meets with his Japanese colleague, Sinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security linkages, as part of his first serious foreign visit after the election in May.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the third largest economy in the world.
Under the heading of the agenda, plans to enhance nuclear cooperation.
India also reportedly looks forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
The Russian Federation will hold its final expert session.
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will jointly hold the third Expert Session on "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations."
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the Agency during the year and will be reported in a press release to the Lents.Ru version.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for the year and to establish an outcome list of indicators to measure the impact of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups and the evaluation criteria.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to establish a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for measuring the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the regulations is being negotiated.
As a result of the next session, we must complete the process of science-based and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said the Director of the Russian Federation ' s Scientific and Analysis Office, Elena Aksenov.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than one hundred scientific institutions in Russia.
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow Time on 16 September 2014 at the city of Moscow, Soljanka Street, house 14.
Scientists found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its impact on chemical homogeneity in star-camps.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will enable the search of related stars, i.e., from one cluster.
The authors published the results of their studies in Nature magazine and are briefly available on the University website.
The same chemical composition of the nearby stars is caused by the turborated mixing in the clouds of gas before the formation of stars.
Even if the star born then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of the formation of natural stars.
Earlier, scientists had doubts that the evolution of the star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of the family to the cluster.
The simulation results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer experts simulated two flows of interstellar gas that formed a cloud together.
This object has been transformed into a cluster of protostars for several million years under its own gravity.
Scientists added paints to initial gas flows and found that high chemical homogeneity was achieved through rapid turbolenation in the cloud.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to search for chemical stars, as well as to identify possible regions for the formation of such facilities.
Carratha police arrested 20 years after the motorcycle was chased at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after passing at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through the Busland to hide from the police in Pilbar.
A transport police patrol in Carrata this morning tried to stop the blue motorcycle, finding its speed to reach 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police report that a motorcyclist did not stop and continue his movement on Burgess Road, then turned into a tower, thus losing sight of him by the police.
The motorcycle and the man corresponding to the driver ' s description were seen near the Walcott Way house in Bulgarr.
Carratha police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and driving dangerously.

Lavrov: Russia will not "stop the door" in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave WTO
Russia will not "stop the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, spoke to the students and teachers of MICIMO today.
With regard to our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even discuss, fantasy, because everything must be specifically designed, he said.
And when we figure out what European and American partners will do this time, then we'll decide how to answer it.
This will not involve the cotton doors, some kind of wrong, misunderstanding, the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, move away from our interests, our interests to protect our economies, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners with regard to their adequacy, sustainability and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions can be very well seen by the partners, and the head of the MDF has continued.
If the whole voice says that "they're gonna be painful for us, too, but we're gonna have to do it to punish Russia," it's probably not very adequate.
With regard to WTO, the Russian Federation did not respond to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when dealing with trade disputes, said Lavrov.
We have already used this toolbox to overcome, we believe, EU discriminatory anti-dumping policies.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and is applying anti-dumping measures against the Russian Federation economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the EU's third energy package should not be applied retroactively," said Lavrov.
How can you use the siren properly in the design of the garden?
Irene Okuneva answers:
Since the siren loses its basic appeal after flourishing, it is desirable to plant it with other bushes.
It's a beautiful combination of many cultures.
And you can and you need to plant plants that are decorative at other times, and that bloom at the same time.
Another plus siren is that it offers a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form her pamphlet tree with different heights, improved bite, broad-based bite, and even like garden bonsai, a village with a fancy, curved stem.
Just choose the form that better matches the design of your garden.
In Karelia, a man of Leningrad province was convicted for selling false money.
According to the National Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man engaged in his criminal activities in Olonets and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in the Volodsk region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, a man appeared before the Oloneck District Court.
And in order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segeju.
The investigation has proved guilt in several episodes of counterfeit money sales related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file with the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of deprivation of liberty by four years in the general regime colony.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Remember, two more counterfeit money salesmen were convicted last week and paid for in Petrozavodsk stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also travelled to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them has five years ' imprisonment and the other is four years ' imprisonment.
Every one has a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
Archangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the first "Derwish" convoy.
The matting that took place at the district centre was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Derwish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arkangelsk, the memorial meeting took place at the stone-stone of the future monument to the northern convoy, which is located on the island name of Cedova in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of the Veteran Archangelsk organizations, children from the cadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago when the stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of memory of those who have not returned the sea," the President of the Council of veterans of the North Seaweed of Boris Karpov noted.
The event was followed by a city music orchestra, and cadets of cadet classes gave flowers to veterans and scrambled with Russian flags and a sign of victory.
Ming's finished putting flowers in the folding stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic raw materials (1,000 tons rubber, 1,500 tons formal shoes, tin, wool and many other tools and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were on board, including 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Harrikain fighters, in a deconstructed state.
At the same time, the convoy was composed of 16 British Navy ships, of which two were carriers.
The caravan of ships was not discovered by the enemy and reached the point of destination, Archangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 were killed and some 50 were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which trade union organizations are protected as civil law.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who is the co-chair of the Progressive Fractia Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on the Empowerment of Workers, together with John Lewis' civil rights movement symbol.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities to discriminate against the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions.
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill are offering is to remember a very American idea.
Despite attacks by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when that country defended democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Todjo ' s paramilitary carcracies had been replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in forming a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism had been replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans had included an article which had openly read: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to impair that right would not have legal effect; measures aimed at that purpose would be considered illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "every individual has the right to organize and join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests."
The U.S. generations accepted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to establish civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that workers should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the union movement has not undermined the power of the nation but has increased them.
In raising the living standards of millions, trade unions have created a market for industry in a wonderful way and have raised a whole nation to an incredible level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers what we should do.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and increased protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are rekindling the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana Act on Sunday, which his supporters say would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadoll in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would have had the authority to receive patients in the hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that doctors can continue to take legal abortions to date, continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to exercise their powers," wrote Judge John DeGravels in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within the month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision on the law.
The defenders of the right to abortion were pleased to have met this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
"Today's decision guarantees that Louisiana's women will be protected from a scheming law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Reproductive Rights Centre, who filed an action to stop the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who had not applied for the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is part of 11 states that have enacted such laws and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Lawyers for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the law on admission powers imposes restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medicine.
Abortion opponents argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effects in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who abortions in Louisiana has the authority to take admission to the hospital reported to the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing the procedure, the doctor, in fear of his safety, would cease to do so, informed the group.
In criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission authority were awaiting decisions.
This will result in the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of product in the range of trade networks should be Russian production, and the deputy of the Gosdum is of the opinion of Oleg Nilov's Fair Russia faction.
The parliamentarian has drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, and it is written by the newspaper Iztelia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
For goods that are not produced in Russia, for the rest of the products produced in Russia, the realist will have to provide at least half of his fields to domestic producers." Nilov reported the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, the draft law amends the Tax Code, which establishes a lower rate of VAT of 10 per cent for products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the docks.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, and experts say.
According to a lawyer from Nalogovic, a member of the independent public Duma expert centre, Sergei Litwinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect would be positive and would lead to growth.
In addition, farmers, farmers, small shops will be farmers.
They can sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the rhythmiers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will grow, some faster learning will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, indeed not immediately," the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to access local shops because of high competition from foreign analogues.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been released and can be sighed with relief.
But it should be borne in mind that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, it's now "the moment of silence" when the former players have already left, and the new players have not yet arrived.
Nearly a month later, the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization, Russian Financial Directors Club, C.E. Tamara Kasyanov, explained the increased demand for domestic raw materials as well as rising prices for finished products.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will make it possible to secure the sector for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another State.
In other words, the buyer ' s struggle will be divided between companies operating under single industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots, far from all items.
In this situation, trade networks will have to "enlarge" the share of Russian products to half the range.
In this regard, there is growing concern that poor goods will be placed on the docks.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be produced in Russia," added by an expert.
The negative effects of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will be affected by this arrangement, as demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some Russian production products may be inferior to imported analogues, while shops can charge prices for the second, as a deficit.
In the early 2000s, the idea of import substitution was once again announced by economists in February this year because of the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
In the face of the difficult relationship with the West, the issue of the elimination of imported products is now becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to require the rhythmiers to be treated as domestic producers when making orders to suppliers.
Then we'll go much faster and more confident on the way to import, and the production planning system on the required products will be put in place in a shorter time frame," says deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover Russia's stores completely.
In addition, meat production can also gain strong momentum.
It is known that the largest share of imports is in beef, ranging from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65-70% of the Russian products are still Russian, and Kasyanov is talking about it.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate and accelerate import substitution.
However, this initiative will not, by itself, lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, and I am sure that Litvinenko will need to do so.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative may still be imported from abroad, which means that there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, few quotas had been set, and domestic products needed to be produced in order to meet those quotas.
These quotas are precisely such guarantees and will be provided," the expert notes.
Untimed diagnosis and lack of access to optimum treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Joley and her brother James published a video of their late mother's memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural Australian women face a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers analysed maps of the disease of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent had lived five years after the diagnosis.
The lead researcher, Susan Jordan, at the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research, reported that the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES: New drugs can slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, current illness and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improvements in the quality of telemedical services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would enable professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were treated far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that the long life expectancy of women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank, Elise Nive, said she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open doors in the Kugener district.
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toctaibelyak began in April of this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Directorate of Public Relations and Information of the Chief Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was financed from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility built is almost 230 square metres.
It will provide medical assistance to the inhabitants of eight localities: the villages of Ttatybalak and the villages of Dementeevo, Püncherümal, Tunya, Fomici, Toraybalak, Shinur and Chaškal.
The new midwifery clinic will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitation requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
The murderer of a four-month-old son in a state of sleep, the new boy, will be brought to justice.
Divashia's wife will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
The criminal investigation of a 31-year-old Newcheboxarska resident accused of causing death due to negligence has been completed in Cheboksars.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year, the accused, together with a four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birthday of the child ' s cube in Cheboksara.
After a long stash, the Newboxman decided to stay in the house and put the baby to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a woman who wasn't sober put it next to her bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman fell on her son and died of suffocation.
The criminal case is reported to the U.S. press service on Chuwashia, sent to the court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Do Russians feel a sharp increase in prices
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will be accelerated and will not be settled in the forecasts of the authorities, and the analysts of the ICB Capital are convinced.
According to the experts, the delayed impact of the anti-sanctions would lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of Minecon Development, inflation will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to Kommersant ' s newspaper, this week the IER should make "small but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast before 2017.
According to the publications, the agency could reduce the inflation estimate for 2015, which would eliminate the expected increase in income.
It was projected that the Russian Federation's food sanctions were valid for the year until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," stated the source of the newspaper in Minfin.
Economists from the ICB Capital do not share the expectations of the Government ' s financial and economic bloc for inflation and forecast price growth at 8 per cent in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will be, together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NSP) in the Russian Federation regions in 2015, the experts are convinced.
The 9 per cent inflation peak will be expected to take place in February, after which the annual price growth rate will fall, the experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat gave up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed "accuracy sanctions."
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Chief of Analysis, FC AForex:
Price increases are already taking place in the main segments of the goods.
Moreover, when socially relevant products began to be valued, the Government had to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Vendors and retellers are already reporting daily to regulators to ensure that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the huge rate of capital outflows, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-halator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the value of the basket of a minimum product set would not jump 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food products has provoked the shock of supply on the domestic market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
As we are not fully able at this stage to launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth.
In addition to the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razovayev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month, and in zero it was higher than the current level, another case, which was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation will be 8 to 8.5%.
Maguta Plato, Asset Manager, Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully delayed, but if pressure continues to increase, first and foremost, the financial sector can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually shown in cash currency purchases to secure their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the Russian Federation CB and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by government regulation.
But price increases begin traditionally after the summer eclipse, and perhaps this fall will become more tangible.
The target level of consumption inflation in Russia is likely to rise by 7.5 per cent, as the Russian Federation has more financial savings.
The gardening centres are saddled by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to the exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may result in gardening centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core age of horticulture," according to the HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent housing spend on average 55 per cent of the amount spent on gardening by owners of their own homes.
It refers to an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the asphalt of the yard in front of the parking house and the decline in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest in Britain was spent on gardening products per household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardener at RHS, said, "The growing of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retailing for horticultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of landlords and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to a better weather following the adverse conditions of March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out mass cleansing at the Landdelelege Foundation.
Three of the four directors of the Landedele Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four Chiefs of the Landdelica Foundation were replaced by another Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has officially reported only the suspension of the post of Executive Director, Atanas Doblev.
Lozan Vasilev took his place.
It turns out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were replaced quietly on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director of Tatiana Angelov, who had been responsible for government assistance and the SAPARD programme, had been released and reported to the AGNES with reference to the Trud newspaper.
I wasn't present at the fund management board because by law we were not members of the board, but I was told later that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the Fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I find out more on Monday," said Angel's edition.
Ivanka Bagdatova, who has so far been the head of the "Investing Credit" at the central fund in Zemelelelia in Sofia, will take her place.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Davchev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
He will be appointed Zhiko Zivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landeledelica Foundation in the city of Grand Tirnovo until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atij Alieva-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey is calling an American diplomat for a spy report.
Turkey ' s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent reported that the American Chargé d ' affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by the former United States National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey had been a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey reduced the importance of this message by saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
Previous reports of what the German General Intelligence Agency has also made Ankara the subject of intelligence have led to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies united against Alibababa
China ' s companies, among which the largest commercial real estate developer in China, the Dalian Wanda Group and the Internet giants Tencent Holdings (Socsets, Messinger et al.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete on the market for online trade with Aliba.
However, it will be difficult to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet that even left behind its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com.
Union of the major
Companies plan to contribute 5 billion yuan (US$ 814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each of the Internet companies, as reported in Wanda Group.
The firm is scheduled to register in Hong Kong.
JS will integrate the Bedou search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social network in China, with a number of users of about 438 million), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 phenels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate sites throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qindao (city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate revenue at $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns an American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the world's largest cinema operator.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own trading centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the Alibaba competition.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead a new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Tse.
The line-to-offline (O2O) of the commerce is to attract customers on the Internet to come to normal offshore shops or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sales of coupons such as the Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "pyrog" in online commerce, " stated the leader of Wanda Van Jianlin (Bloomberg citata).
"Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal for all," he considers.
China's Internet Trade Market is the world's largest market, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will increase by more than three times by 2015, from 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, bringing Bloomberg data on official statistics: this is larger than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And it is projected that this number could rise to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten until recently was China's richest man, but according to the Bloomberg millionaire index, Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, has already overwhelmed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
The leader of Baidu Robin Lee is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Van Jianglin of Wanda is the fourth line of rating.
"For this battle, it is very interesting to see: the three richest people are united in their efforts to challenge the more rich," said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce Studies in Hanzhou Tsao Lay.
But he thinks that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba right after being created: "Raim cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not like this is simply competing not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved world Internet leaders is evidenced by the previous day ' s report on Alibaba ' s last quarter ' s financial performance.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
The net profit of Alibaba over the period is almost twice as high as that of competitors - it grew almost three times annually at $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has great potential for money generation, largely thanks to its mobile applications," commented on Bloomberg's report by an analyst from Hong Kong Aret Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba site of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company ' s services in July was 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were carried by mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares in front of IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the debut of Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on 16 September.
The Road Show company that preceded this event starts on September 3th.
It is expected that the release of Alibaba to IPO will be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the record of the United States stock exchanges has been owned by the Visa payment system, which, in 2008, made a first deposit of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in trade networks should be Russian production, and the deputies of the State Duma consider it.
They have drafted a bill on this subject.
This is an amendment to article 8 of the Federal Trade Regulatory Frameworks in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the draft law, of at least 50 per cent of domestic production products in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruit in winter, so that they will be provided with a "skid" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for all food products whose country of origin Russia is a country of origin, and reports the newspaper Iztelia.
On 27 August, a draft law was introduced to the lower House of Parliament to amend the FZ "On retail markets," which proposes to re-establish farmers' markets in Russia in which small producers will be able to produce their products.
Chief of the Magaluf Police has been charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on Malorca's resort island was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandalous centre of unbridled drunken Magalufa.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of charges of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the streets where most of the bar and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario ' s daily online survey, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Malorca Anti-Corruption Attorney on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the National Guard of Spain on charges of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition of ABC reported that the ungrateful owners of nightclubs said that protectionism on the part of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"The child is no longer about making money, it's about surviving," told the court one of the businessmen.
Our sources of existence cannot be compromised.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was caught in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube, which showed a 18-year-old British vacationer who was blowing 24 men during a bar race.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to put an end to the insecurities among the resting Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous alcoholic bargings.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the mortar incident took place, was forced to close down for a year, while the Playhouse and the Carnage bar organizers together were fined an amount of US$55,000 ($73,000).
Magaluf's tourist resort, mainly popular among young British resters, was also the scene of numerous alcohol accidents associated with a crazy fun, known as balconing, when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to Aeroport Adelaide
WESTA prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and heavy winds that affected the flights to Aeroport Adelaide.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city by the evening of 9pm, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell out the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short larvaes with a blasting wind, including a storm that started just before 8 p.m. and spilled almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave early springs last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Squalist conditions are expected to be one of the reasons for the delay in the flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but fell into the wind shift zone - a sudden change in speed or a short-range wind direction - and was forced to pick up the height.
Wind explosions reached 50 km/h on the ground in Aeroport Adelaide at this time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to pick up the height during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the flight resulted in the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two livnes.
Estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will be updated
The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control of the issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problems of connectivity.
An expert board for building competition has been established under the FAS.
At its meeting, the head of the Directorate of Control of the ZKH, Construction and Natural Resources of FAS Vadim Solovyev stated that "the current calculation of the construction site estimates is totally unclear."
The regulatory framework makes pricing not transparent and can lead to unreasonable construction prices, and is considered to be in FAS.
And we suggest the cost of building public utility facilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, constructive solutions instead of current estimates and single rates for technological operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are currently under consideration in the mini-grid.
"The replacement of traditional construction estimates for design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained the "WGB" by Vadim Solovyev.
Because the estimates now count every bolt and gyke, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, bad construction companies can bury the "cell tractors."
There's an agreement in the ministrous with the FAS.
"The first work on the conversion to design elements is already in place: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of constructive solutions and estimates for these indicators," told the Chief of the Department of Urban Planning and Mine Development Architecture, Elena Zhukov.
Road construction has been chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the GB, the head of the Profi-invest construction company Anatoly Demianco, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism has not yet been proposed for business.
"As for the proposed calculations of the design elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, as construction of buildings often uses very different technologies," he considers it.
It's not a secret that the builder is developing much thanks to the state order.
According to the President of the Board of the NPP, the "Expert Community of State Order Professionals" of Catherine Lezina, today the State is the most solvent employer.
The Director of Engineering of the Industrial Capital Centre, Rosatoma Vladimir Malakhov, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditional on companies that have access to the contract portfolio and on companies that have monopoly competence and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was as far away from someone's influence manager as possible.
The expert board was requested to establish a system of State order in such a way that the same perpetrator could not obtain more than one contract of more than 1 billion roubles or several contracts of more than 1 billion roubles.
The small-scale view is that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, it would then be necessary to assign the employer the functions of the contractor, which would result in an increase in the customer ' s staffing and budgetary costs for its maintenance.
In doing so, the customer ' s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work performed by the contracting organizations.
Often with this breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in a reversal of highly qualified public procurement participants owing to a lack of interest in obtaining a partial government order and a small amount of contract.
The heads of the expert advisory centre of the Institute of Procurement, Alexander Eussašenkov, believe that the State order procedure has now become a business game for the contractor ' s scrutiny.
And he gave this example: "The party in filling the application should specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words "or equivalent," "should be," "from," "more," "less," "atax," "or," "type," "like," "not lower," "low," "over," "may," "may have," "may be," "be," "be," "be" or "not previously," "not above," "not allowed," etc.
Thus, requisitioners often abuse their right to determine the content of the application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ, in the view of Eustashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the application stage.
In considering the participant ' s application, only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been done, can be realistically assessed, is the expert ' s opinion.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when they are accepted.
The expert board was also requested to move the margin income from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the State Secretary, the FAS owner, Andrei Czarikovsky, believes that this should not be done because the contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's gonna be like the famous reprieve of Arkady Rickin "Atele," "Do the buttons have a claim?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories, near the Gaza Strip, returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory was restored after the fighting.
The beginning of school classes has brought joy and anxiety to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the signs of fighting have remained fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, Pashosh children's kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's peas before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to see the future," said Ronite Bart, a resident of Kibutz Saad, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to the standard of living.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she suddenly started going back to school a little weird.
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Raven Rivlin visited Kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go outside or leave their homes, leaving to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was a great deal of Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas ' s demand to lift the Israeli-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
It is expected that a new phase of proximity talks will begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, of whom three quarters were civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and argues that at least half of those killed were fighters; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 aerial and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people were sheltered in more than 100 schools, which were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices have shown the largest winter growth in seven years.
RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital grew by 1.1 per cent in August, reporting RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a cumulative increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12 months increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The director of RP Data Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The next market power was Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged between 5 and 6 per cent.
On the other end of the scale, there was Canberra, which experienced government cost cuts, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items placed on sale over the next few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
"Taking into account the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
How people live in Ufa's oldest house
In the former house of gold industry and miners, Evdokim and his son, Ivan Demidov, on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Casan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has not changed much since the construction, except for the wind.
Foreign people walk here as a tour, and tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege, the right to live in the oldest Ufim house, whose walls are remembered by Alexander Suvorov's half leader.
The date of building the house is not clear, historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, violin stairwell.
The doors to the flats are close to each other, the walls were slit, and in the light of the blew-up stick, the street was visible.
I think it's all right.
And the locals say, "You don't think it is."
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, " says Tatiana Lukianov, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on State security, but the money for its maintenance isn't for decades, and we feel like museum exponents that the authorities have forgotten.
Last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still strong, but the foundation has rotten.
Many tenants still go to the bathroom on the street and pee once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content with such conditions?!
The road goes right under the windows, even the pedestrian area is gone.
Tatiana's pushing the curtain.
Now you can see what you've heard before: the car flow is under the windows.
You see, the glass is dulling all the time, we can't open windows, but we're used to noise.
Man gets used to everything, to good and bad things.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms, three of us live with our son.
And other families have a much worse condition, on the second floor, a ceiling of just over one and a half metres high.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Ludmila Starstina.
A nice welcome woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and a sad smile says:
We have a single-room apartment, 14.5 square metres per four people, and we live with a husband and a daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another residential area, and Ludmila's eyes are like an anthresoli, two couchs with "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But the ceiling is running regularly: the water supply system isn't going anywhere.
Ludmila talks about his apartment normally and surprisingly at the same time as an Italian woman whose house is on Roman ruins.
So it turns into one very old and recent, day-to-day and legendary:
The water pipeline lasted about 40 years ago during the last repairs.
Then they made us a little kitchen in the dining room and a toilet from an ex-clan.
We live just where Damids and his family were living on the second floor, and servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Centre, they say privatization is irrelevant.
We'll get only a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to dislodge us, but we didn't get any further promises.
I'm not used to complaining and I'm not.
There was a whole dynasty in this apartment: my grandparents, my mom and dad, me and my husband and my granddaughter.
It's been all this time.
For example, healthy rats were running through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the fligiel, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed in on the eggs, so it's been so long.
The house is built, thanks to Demidov!
I guess that's the only reason why no one's been killed by a ceiling or shaved.
Only construction still slowly dies in front of us: the docks and the logs of the house rot, the floors fail on several occasions, we pour cement, but it's useless, the solution goes to the ground like a well.
They say it's under our secret laz room and the way to the White River, which was specially made by some old men who lived here so that they could escape the danger, in which case.
They were being chased.
Ludmila Starsteen tells us how some historian came to them, begged him to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them a space in exchange for his single on October.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are we gonna be four alone?
And there's a little hope here that they're gonna give the place easier.
We agreed to trade, we wouldn't win anything anymore.
However, the family of the Old Ages won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be dispersed, and a 16-year-old granddaughter's daughter gave a separate room.
So two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations are now living.
A pretty, miniatur girl, Olesa Carsakova, from apartment No. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There's a large family living there in two close rooms with a total area of 23 m2.
We're seven people, two kids.
You can see the terms.
Stucturate is dumped with pieces, like windows, in the walls on the kitchen and in the rooms through the holes.
The water in the crane is cold all year round.
When you go to the apartment of Ufa's oldest house, you can make sure that the most fortunate of all are Laurentiev's wives from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most simple rooms in the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
75 squared space, three people registered.
We live just in the rooms where the legend stopped the Suvorov during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrievich Laventiev.
The ceiling is high, it's simple.
One bad thing is, everybody's slamming around the stitches, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have told me already!
The most torment we have with the floors is that the wooden boards have been rotten, the earth has literally left underneath our feet.
I've put the backs, the clinja, and there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room we walk like the swings, it's so tight.
The house of Evdokim Demidov's merchant Alexander Dmitrievich can be better known than any tournament.
The gold industry treats it as a mother, speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the identity was unusual: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, poured guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The apprentices are proud, but they don't want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
At that time, there were wooden spaces for carnets, stables and guard booths that were subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something was wrong...
History was repeated in 2014: new housing was again lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran away from the necessary authorities, and suddenly we learned that the move to the apartment was being carried over to 2015 or 2016.
Something doesn't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The residents weren't accepted.
They sent a paper from one table to another, and then, like a mockery, they issued a paper without a signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even feel like our house hasn't been in town for a long time since it was first number 57, then it was 57 A, and now it's 57/1.
It's like he was already dumped in the '70s.
The Russian Planet approached Ufa Vladimir Barabash, the head of the land administration information and analysis sector.
A house on the streets of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the settlement programme for the humid housing sector.
I can't take responsibility for the actions of officials in the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at that time to demolish all old houses, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of modern authorities to rebuild all old houses on the streets of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
Residents are expected to be resettled in new apartments shortly.
According to Barabash, the reconstruction of the Demidova House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the renovation of the buildings in Venice.
Italy is now undergoing an architectural bininal, and the Old Ufa project is represented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire Old Casan Street will be restored, the official says.
Houses will be given an appropriate view of what was before, three centuries ago.
Demidova's house is likely to be a museum open to all those who want it.
In addition, at the governmental level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
There's, unfortunately, too much congestion in the city in the wake.
To settle people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied with their new apartments being the same size as the present ones.
Only from another era.
Forest fire started in Primorje due to the storm
The dry storm resulted in a forest fire in the Hunting Land Forest in the Pojar district of the Primorsk province.
At the scene of the fire, a group of forces and funds is being built up.
According to the IPSAS leadership, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of the aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Airbase:
The fire, which occurred in a difficult area, was discovered by an observer pilot from an An-2 patrol aircraft in the area of 3 hectares.
The wood remains on the old gorilla are burning.
The severe defrosting of the area and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing fire landing sites create significant difficulties in the running.
A MI-8 helicopter is needed.
The delivery of the force by the Mi-2 helicopter and AN-2 aircraft available to the airbase is severely hampered.
After the fire was discovered, four fire parachutes were planted quickly at the site of the carving.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing forces and equipment.
In the lunch area, three fire detectors were added to the area of the village of the Hunting Helicopter.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the tourist site on the site of the Primorsk province administration.
My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in Jamaica's immigrant family to Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry's rehearsing comedy, Rudy's Red Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew from a series of Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of ruggy and rap, and melody is life-loving.
However, Henry had to go through some of the difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, there was a lot of treatment, and Henry often thinks about his father's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get off your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a sneaky guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a lithium workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions became better than in his father's day, he was able to look at what his life must have been.
It's a little better right now, but it's dark, smokey, deep labyrinths of the ponds with fire and smoke and a bunch of sauce.
My father went into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself, because he wanted to get away from the lithium workshop.
When I got there, I realized that he'd been doing it for years and years to earn us food, and I started to appreciate it more.
However, Henry was out of childhood without parental love.
My father never huged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he missed when he was a kid.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop huging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, where he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious exercise with phytens, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he got a critique confession for his Otello, he's been completely in the theater.
I've been following the "Memorial of Errors" and then the "Charters" of August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedy, which were an irremovable attribute of his full professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
Dejay noticed him falling on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His career on television began in the middle of the '70s: "For a long time, I was the only black parodist/comic on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an effective machine to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny's New Faces in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Mentraps Show, a light entertainment program in which people "browned their face," Henry discovered that he had been in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I don't think I want that to happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked at large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award of a lightly entertaining class on British television for years and years" was also "the threat to black people."
By representing the characters who were mocking the black culture in the UK and chasing it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Haw Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the virgins it was known as, among other things, chief chef Gareth Blacklock of the Shef comedy series.
The commercials, documentary films, television series and role in the movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his series on BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, 'cause it seems a little bit like you're pulling time or slowing away?"
There was a series of documentaries on Radio 4, entitled "What's the good of...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy on Shakespeare.
You can't tell me to teach that in school, and I thought it was, in large part, the prerogative of middle-class white people with cottages and cabbage downstairs.
So I was really scared of him.
Everyone we've interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try it.
Don't swear it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Otello's last monologue for documenting, and he got caught.
I feel like I can do it.
It's like I got my head out.
"That's what this is, it's a serious case, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it in.
And she was successful.
It seemed they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon, we started the "Cody of Errors."
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was one moment I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside of me said, "You're gonna have to work ten minutes while they're scratching the computer."
Instead, the Assistant Director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else figure it out.
"You play play, stay in the game."
Henry's at the Cathedrals at the Duchess Theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the fences.
Panic's pretty useful, she's strengthening the musculature.
She was also well accepted, so it was like a sign from above, showing me, "That's what you need to do."
He says it, of course, by a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has comedy's thinking - all the way we've been talking over his humour flashes when he starts, he's gonna end up paroding.
I just decided not to work on the bench because this thing with the instant remuneration from the full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do that, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work on Apollo's Dirty Lives when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to do.
I'm asking if he's ever gonna give a standup tour.
Joy to sit in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I'd ever want to refuse it.
So that's his new version?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice funny thing.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has started a biometric registration of all public officials in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in State structures after he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700000) per month was lost through payments to "unseers" and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to enter bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports to BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must report to identification centres within the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure is reported in a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payroll and will be reported in it.
"This procedure will significantly improve the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the balance sheet at both levels of government - thus putting an end to the problem of "invisible workers," told Ann Wyguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Structure of Power.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the "reservation" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the Government" and reported by local information agencies.
Police representatives did not comment immediately on this information.
There were 14 high-ranking officers among the detainees, according to Harriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (who was the Prime Minister at that time) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cliché Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine opened their doors again on Monday (1 September) after summer vacation.
This day has traditionally been a great event for families, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Jazenuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held at every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastukhov, head of school in Slavyansk, where Jazenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been marked by the fact that children wear dried shirts, hold balloons and give flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead's face, BBC may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It's followed by the plaque of fame from the banking world, the media administration and the inner quarters of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own leadership experience.
Her career began at the global governance consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world media in Pearsons.
She was head of the Financial Times for seven years when she resigned when she took up a senior position at the Pearson's head company as a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Her political ratings are also high.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband's former adviser to Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two orientations: inwards as the top management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would risk coming in, displeasing and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he himself lost his job in this process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC fall in size - after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable negotiations on the value of a licence pose a particular risk to BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a share in the world's most definitely the greatest media enterprise.
BBC tells a good story: it states that its results cover 96 per cent of households and account for only 40p per day for each of them.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 per cent support it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The BBC search and use models have changed: now I get news headlines on my cell phone and watch the missing iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it's found him.
Perry from Texas says a humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
Tweet from the confirmed account of Governor Texas of the Republican Rick Perry on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats, who is at the centre of criminal proceedings for abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed and followed by another one from Perry's account, where the tape was devastated.
Just since my account, the Twitter that was written by someone else has been published.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it out," reports a later recording.
The Perry assistants did not respond immediately to the communications requesting comments.
Although the records were downloaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was not clear who actually published the tape.
The earlier tweet contained an illustrious cartoon at Travis Rosemary Lemberg District Attorney, who found himself guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry banned the financing of her department when she refused to resign, leading to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate for the 2016 elections.
"I don't always drive a car intoxicated condition three times the permissible level of blood alcohol, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's headquarters did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
They were dealt with by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry didn't confess guilt and called the charges a political trick.
His strong legal team asked the lead judge to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who was the longest in Texas' history, was vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from state funds to the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is responsible for prosecuting corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Véto raised an official complaint from a group of public control with left-hand views.
The Lent of Perry's confirmed account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When he came to the party's fifth convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he could leave the game by publishing a tweet with a picture of himself running near the lake, and by saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to normal status.
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England had "turned" to normal activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of intense demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and president of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday, "From the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013," adding that it provided a "stable working environment."
The London Real Estate Market was successful during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Survey, significantly overestimated the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for the private, affordable and student schemes of Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London ' s real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion" before the general election next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent loan terms, would also reduce market growth in both real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, with further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices had already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley, raising sales above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added: "The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the sales for a period of time remain."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April - almost one third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual income prior to tax payments increased by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, prior to the company ' s annual meeting, Mr. Pijley reported that Berkeley ' s projected income for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, profits are expected all year before taxes of £450 million are paid.
Berkeley's stock value was £23.96 in the afternoon at the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence are published on the Internet by a hacker.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th American Film Academy award ceremony.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures me that she has a "catal" photo of 100 more rising stars.
The star spokesman for the Blue Games confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for "aggravated invasion of personal space."
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted and they will pursue anyone who will publish the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the 4chan exchange site were allegedly derived from the lack of an online security system for Apple iCloud, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims included the names of a dozen women denominators, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are true, although Scott Pilgrim's star against everyone, Winstead, on Twitter, also condemned the hack.
"The one who looks at the pictures we took with my husband a few years ago, leaving home, "I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nicolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria Winner" series denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of the naked me FALSHIVKI, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop star, Ariana Grande, denied that the photos on which she was believed to be true.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that praised critics
They were dissolved, the best thing to say is that they gradually fell apart, like the cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard in communication, tense, closed, and maybe a little irritating.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw his irritation.
He was stabbing like a jackass, yeah.
The last victim of this crucifix was a little novel from which he expected more than usual relief from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a wretched, fragile beauty with broken hair and a crumbling heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsher than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevin considered to be her aunt, and the last one inherited a house in the cheese, but a paradise-like valley called "Ray Valley."
No one has lived in the house for years.
The pipes were running, spiders were sitting in the bathtubs, slugs left their marks on all windows confident that the house belonged to them; the garden rose with weeds similar to the giant couchs of cabbage.
It was like a baby book cottage, both scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
The author ' s view is Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Bukerov Prize Longlist in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eilenn were sitting behind their hands, in broken sheslings in the high grass, enjoying a sudden warm spring day; they were both scatteredly connected to a cheap console that provided the country with a peaceful music and a calming news when, after looking at its crazy brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black artist who loved to listen to his father by emptying the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of his aggressiveness, the songs of this kind on the cones were no longer lost.
They weren't banned - nothing was prohibited - they weren't lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archic" itself.
The social taste was what would never have been able to achieve orders and regulations, and just as among books people chose the memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, from all the music, they chose ballads.
Have fun this afternoon, Kevern started playing in an imaginary piano and a rude comic voice to sing Eileen's big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he said to her, machined with two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she went off his lip.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't really fun right now.
He knew he was expecting it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz wasn't playing either, although he wasn't openly banned.
Improvised out of fashion.
There's only one place left in life if.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same thing with the wit.
His unpredictability acted on people's nerves.
And jazz was a spicy thing expressed with music.
Although he was 10 years old, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembers the time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who saved their fate - with the principle of group preposition.
Afro-Caribbean people, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The Indians, as if they were naturally talented in all the electronics, had to make sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was carried out with sanitary work; what was left of the Greeks was broken by plates.
Members of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly when THO, WHO PROHISHO, EVERYTHING PROHICLE, were afraid that they would be accused of inflamming flames, in fact saying that the flame would swallow them up next, opened restaurants with labs and kalyans, and they wouldn't get out of their minds.
Everybody's capable.
Since she'd heard only ballads before, Eileen was hard to understand how offensive words that Kevin had just sang to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Unless maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the run-up garden gave him the illusion of security.
No word could penetrate through the sound isolation of giant leaves like cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love this?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
She bumped her head, closed Keverna's view.
There was nothing in the world but the cops of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if that's what you say," she said, staying in her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're eating it for me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you precisely because you have fat ankles," he tried to say it instead.
I have such a pervert.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations, because, like his father, he was deprived of the calming charm that could alleviate the cruelty that was being ratted into jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he did, Kevern, too.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the necklace, throwing down the consol and the spring of wine they had been drinking.
Wine from the basket, so drunkenness couldn't justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like you, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned her back on him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that she was like this in the main features.
The same huge ice ocean struck both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and capricious after TOGO, WHO PROHISCO, EMPLEMENTING PRODUCTION than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in rage from pub to pub, willing to raise their hand to any woman who dared to deny them or to smash them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first, kissing is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fine ballads that gave the consol is to kiss her first and then hit her.
Too much clarification, according to Kevern, because kissing yourself was already bully.
Eileen Solomons showed the body that he needed to leave.
He's climbing out of the throat like an old man.
She felt the lead weight herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him walk away, her companion was a man who had himself been burdened.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought she was.
She felt compassion for him and men at all, even though some of them raised their hands at her.
A man who turned away from her, with a broken back, ashamed, fought, all the ability to fight left him - why did she feel that she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any case until today when she would have seen it?
One Eileen Solomons looked at her feet again.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ofnau, an informal public opinion control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium-level violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to decrease, unless it ceased, given the means and forces that had been allocated to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and much has been done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow scattered areas where, despite the slapping of churches over the fences, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some of the qualities appear to be unexplained.
The higher the wrist, it seems, the lower the passions it creates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballasts, swallows stories of obstacles overcome and announces its dust of faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only old rudeness retains its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and vicious idiotism is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her science director, reading the entire report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme insisted again on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking" finally said Luther Rabinitz, "not because I'm against atheistism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some hypersensitive, completely acceptable and commendable in itself, can sometimes distort results, such as those that you have shown me.
Obviously, you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "devil" and "drum," others would interpret as an expression of natural life and energy.
To continue to wear that message, which PROHIBILE, EMERGENCY PRODUCTION, as if it had happened, if any, yesterday, meant depriving the country of the life it needed.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinitz was talking.
After his head, pink letters, like flaming, repeated the advice that Ofnau had given the country the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your wife, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word of the song is better than the word written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," said Esme Nussbaum quietly when she ascertained that her science director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we didn't heal as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm worried that if we're not ready, we'll find out that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to the THOSE that PROHICLE, EVERYTHING PRODUCTION.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust away from others.
Luther Rabinovic put his fingertips in the pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to mean infinite patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "calling for mistakes" actions that either did or did not do our grandfathers.
You go too far and when you say they threw away their "glows" and "untrust" on "others."
In your place, a man should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" or "they."
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"who, if honest with herself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
Then it was.
Nothing else needs to be said, we agree here.
And how you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it was appropriate or if you could fix something.
But why the past, if not to learn--
The past makes us forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther Rabinovic's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll see your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk as described by the passers, "in evil rage."
Coincidence happens.
The Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The members of the Lesotho Army denied that a coup had been prepared to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that the country ' s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he was at risk of attempting his life.
Major Ntlee Ntoi, an army spokesman, stated that there had not been a coup, but that the army had responded to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police had attempted to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho took action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are actually planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were prepared to create chaos," he informed the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monjeela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
"If no one had claimed to seize power by force, it was all reported that the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces currently had the main signs of a coup," he said.
The members of the Lesotho Army reported that soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motettejoa Metsing runs the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked by an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his joint Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government despite the charges against the contrary.
A half-man of Chelsea Marco van Ginkell will spend the coming season renting at Milane, reporting Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
In the last season, he only went to the field of London Club three times.
Let's recall that Mylan had previously rented from Liverpool the attacker Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at the lowest rate in 13 months
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The latest value of the Eurozone ' s Business Activity Index (PMI) on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 points to growth.
New orders were delayed and businesses were affected by the growing tension between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will wait from the bank for a clear plan on how to cope with the eurozone recovery stop, as well as with the risk of inflation deflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is assumed that ECB leader Mario Dragi later this week may give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"If any growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of real concern, as does Italy ' s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Mr. Dobson also said that Mr. Dobson did not add confidence to the recognition that the momentum of growth had been lost mainly by the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands."
The slowing down of industry is likely to further spread oil into the fire to analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3 at its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone Business Activity Index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The producers of the eurozone apparently find life very difficult at this moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly linked to Russia/Ukraina - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has apparently struck business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "it's more like" that the ECB, of course, will have to make some kind of quantitative mitigation, "though we suspect it'll be limited."
The inhabitants of Mariupula will be exposed to a live chain against the militias
In Mariupla, until last week, everything was calm - no one was trying to organize the Mariuple People ' s Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the inhabitants are looking forward to the arrival of the "completion."
According to political scientists, separatists are breaking up with Mariupol to get to the Azov Sea - the town of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not previously part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariopolists have decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but the forces have a little against the excellent armed elements of the NPD-LN, and have gathered to help the military.
They're digging trenches, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday night, several thousand residents arrived on the eastern border of the city, and they entered the living chain, singing anthem of Ukraine.
They're gonna do the same when they get there.
Volunteers collect and collect equipment and food, collect drugs, publish the paper.
In the city, shops are gradually shut down and banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years of a terrible school grabbing, like the children who were in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen fighters at the Beslan School, in the south of Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school.
Ten years later, after the terrible seizure of a school of nolan, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, who had suffered a heroic catastrophe last night, were warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like an extreme degree of evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in a disgusting manner that had dramatically expanded and the hope for the future in the midst of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school.
We found amazing young people who were struggling with trouble, although memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now terrorizing Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl who's trying to get back to the shooting gym in the picture.
It's sealed on a photograph of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitri Belyakov, when in one underwear, she tried to get back into a firefighted sports hall after the explosion of a mine.
Aida was desperate for her mother, Larissa, who is 40 now.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run out of her power, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had recovered completely, but yesterday she said, "The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces are left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the same way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too severe.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dr. Gapov was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the capture stays with her, although the memories are a little boring every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misfortunes, and we are so grateful for the help we received from British people and from everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I'm going to the school window, I think a lot of people will see her for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail bullet, believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians begin school at 7 years of age) and survived three days of capture, hugging their mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Beg."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the baby by his hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with injuries on his feet, in turn thinking that her son was dead.
After their reunification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira later arrived in London (now non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Children from Barnardo's Premier Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that he's gonna slip out of my mind.
I remember when I dumped all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer-playing games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted and travel in a car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to a mountain that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was doing volunteer work in a women's convent last week.
I'm so trying to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and I hope that I'll be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the creepy silence right after the capture, just there were no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized how people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can support them.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her foundation for that reward and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the berth, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so prepared to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think this world hasn't been better in the last 10 years.
There is now a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just the same kids as ours.
For many people, I think war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he's not aggressive nor evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not obsessed with this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports hall from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
Didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, Damir is 17, he's taller than me, pretty, smart and healthy.
It's hard for me to believe that for a few hours I was so sure he died and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and I stood on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming at him, "Damie, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilyin, 17
The boy whose shocking picture after the capture became the defining one for the tragedy in Beslan.
Relax: Beslan Georgi Ilin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004 and Georgie's right today
On his bloody face, he had a print of fear when he was rescued from death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54 years old, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of the nightmare," she remembered.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Wests in the soul: The photograph of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie so wanted to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and she's hidden in the book closet at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photo makes people from around the world feel our pain.
Georgie says now, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they're investigating Boing's crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't figure out how this is going on, 'cause if you ask people, no one wants war, because what's going on?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to take decades to forget her a little.
She affected my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares because of the capture, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the University of Medicine in Vladikavaz.
I'm gonna learn to be a cardiosurger.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a suicide bomber
It's unbelievable that Georgius Farniev was in the hands of a suicide bomber during the capture, but he survived.
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a suicide bomber's feet.
Indeed, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," said Georgie, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but he was unable to do so because of the damage he suffered during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things, - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, next year, there was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgius Farniev today with a photograph of himself on his laptop at the hospital after the seizure
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as physical condition is concerned, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going okay.
But health still prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second attraction was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children of my experience.
It's not what children need to know, and of course it's not what they need to survive.
His mother, Marina, 42 years old, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my shower, worse when the anniversary is coming.
I'll go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie's not gonna do it.
It's got to be even stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me, and here in Beslan, the prints lie on everyone.
He's staying with us.
Georgie's an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terriblely unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knees.
He's had some surgery, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's over 50 percent of this nightmare, but it's impossible to get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and it only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have made, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and it's hard for me to believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we were fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could capture all the rebels and throw them away, as far away as we can.
Alain Tskaev, 10 years old
A baby who was moved to a safe place by a SWAT fighter.
Saved: Aline Tskaev is taken to a safe place by a Russian special forces combatant (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alyna was taken from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go, but with cruelty left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christine and brother Mahar in the school sports hall.
Mahar, who was three years old, was rescued, but Alaina's mother and sister died in a deadly massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter whom he called Christine to remember the daughter he lost.
Aline, who's ten now, remembers nothing about the capture, and spit into a smart and life-loving girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Synji Kagawa, a half-defendant who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund Borussia, said he looked forward to coming back to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in the career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm gonna play "Borussia" again, " says Bild the words of Kagawa.
I feel really good.
I'm full of positive emotions, and I look forward to going back to the field in the form of "Borussia."
Remember, Kagawa moved to MU from Bosnia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was still unable to join the English club, having spent only 38 matches in two seasons in the English Championship, beating six balls and giving eight performances.
The man is accused of raiding a girl on the foot crossing of the pelican in Faifa.
A 78-year-old man will be brought to trial on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl on the foot crossing of the pelican in Faifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and knocked down the girl, causing her injury.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstur, denied his guilt in the Dandy Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, set the date of the trial for January.
Obama, Merkel and Holland won't go to Vladi East.
The duty-free trading shop Duti Free Airport of Vladivostok has placed a sign prohibiting purchases in this store by a number of world political leaders.
Don't get rid of them with spirits, vodka, and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, Chancellor FRG Angela Merkel, French President François Holland, Vitaly Klicco, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan, and several other known comrades would not be able to cook vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from entering an even less accessible facility, the Diet Cups, which had been reported by the General Services website.
Whether the American president had ever dreamed of eating in a diematic cafeteria in Russia, was unknown, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly seemed to be very witty to themselves.
Whether there's cheese after the embargo: the bears gave advice to the Agriramians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that, under the embargo, the Russian Agrarias should develop new technologies in order to produce consumer-driven cheese varieties.
The Board was presented at the time of a visit to Agrocompleks, a South-Pycepher Company.
The head of Government also gave the council to the Rectors to shift to Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo has been introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The main coach of Russia's team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation Tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result, given the lack of focused preparations for the competition.
Our athletes spoke at their level, saying "All sports" the words of Maslakov.
Third place is proof of our high command level.
It's a pleasure that the French and even Americans' advantage over us is minimal.
We should take into account that we weren't preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to participating in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've become second on this tournament, but we've had a fresh start in this season.
The French, on the contrary, set up a fighting team comprising 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was repeatedly publicly announced.
But even this kind of composition of the hosts of the competitions couldn't resist the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have come to such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important as a result, especially in command-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And as a result, I agree, it's absurd when men were so attracted to the tactical hikings of the run, which showed the results below the average level of... women's escapes.
4 clues on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film a video under water, you have a number of options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof mouse, such as Nikon Coolpic AW120, or an ex-camera, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
Whatever equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof cell, make sure the cell battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
In addition, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to film.
Some photo and video cameras have camera regimes or a type of facility that optimize the display for the shaded underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can fall down.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 feet or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take off some staff because many of them won't.
The Mouses have a CDC that will help you copy the images, while the excams don't usually have them.
Even if you have a CDC, it'll be hard to look under the water, and the coroner's composition will be random.
So do a few personnel.
Also, if your camera has a serial survey mode that removes a few personnel with a few different display facilities, use it.
Stay by the surface.
The number of light decreases significantly than you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you're filming the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to transmit more colour in photographs; the deeper you will leave, the less color you will see.
Let's get closer to the shooter sites.
It's a great board to survey on land, but it's even more important under water because of the dark light conditions.
Especially important, if you're filming an excam, this equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're gonna have to get close to the survey facilities if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 bronze prize for the 2012 Olympics at the Bilal Mahov Volt struggle could go into the Greek-Roma struggle.
This was reported by the Chief Coach of the Dagestan Voltility of Sajid Sajidov.
The expert did not exclude the participation of an athlete at the Peace Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahov is on the team of "classes," citing Sajid Sajidov's "R-Sport" words.
As a matter of fact, the young people of Bilal also performed in both styles.
On the 2005 youth front of the world, he was the winner of the Voltarian Tournament and the third prize in the Greek-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free struggle.
It's been a long time since we talked about the new phase of our career as our heavyweight in the Greek-Roma struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can speak at the Peace Championship in Tashkent if he wins the discount.
But a decisive word is always behind a trainer headquarters led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to freeing the sick from both the suffering of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalled that he was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are diagnosed and ill, those who undergo treatment are mainly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he became the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting symptoms similar to flu, he discovered that he was annoyingly blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliette left for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to make a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in French Alps.
The X-ray results are here.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the plevre or the skin of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to find out exactly why.
Although some smokers are sick of lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, a fibre-proof building material that was once called "the mind," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestus, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: plumbers, builders, carpenters and doc workers, for example.
Industrial toxins from another age, he hardly sees cause for concern today.
But this calm is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die from mesothelioma here than any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from this disease than by road accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Britain
The reason why we feel its fatal effects now is that, although asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And to attack mesotheliomas is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases remains, laid in houses where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, Mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastion of election, from the fashionable London-based universities to private schools, proved not to be a salvation.
The building of Parliament is downgraded by asbestos.
Even hospitals that are meant to treat us have proved to be tanks of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber.
In fact, he had to think where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Gay Hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and cargoers used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers are gonna get the same disease?
It was a question that unfortunately he could give a partial answer.
"out of four doctors who had been trained at the Gay Hospital and who had subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010 "I'm alone alive."
How many of us are going to get sick of this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live for so long.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us are going to get sick of this same disease?"
According to the lead expert on mesothelioma in Britain, Professor Julian Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain must survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't think they're gonna die like this right now.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotheliomas have been attacked.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been under surveillance in contact with asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading clothing divisions at two sites, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years of age.
" Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't even think that it would hurt me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "absistform," which means a fibre-optic structure that informs them of their strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, on-line stoves, thermosolation of pipes, boilers, even in car brake wells.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of harm to health" that could lead to death.
Brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite) are, however, more dangerous.
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are strong, although indirect grounds for believing that this is the main reason for the extremely high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]."
Marks & Spencer's employee was exposed to asbestos at the company's main store on Oxford Street, London Alamy.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of the sick, which suggests that "the real percentage of mesothelia, when there is no known impact on the workplace or at home, is likely to be caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the "normal use and impact of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the heart of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committee premises were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be driven by something as harmless as "strong air flows."
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Parliamentary Technical Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean sanitary certificate," it had now recognized that work was needed to rebuild Parliament by improving the electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the general elections of 2015, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre nearby rather than at the Westminster green bench.
Goddard's report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with various rules."
It's impossible to know if this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who failed to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where it worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day of early December 2009, when he was hit by something that looked like flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late tonight.
Suddenly, I began to be fevered.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming out of the plevre, the skin around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
In the end, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The doctors who were puzzled made X-rays of the thorax and placed pleurative catheters to pull the liquid out of the lungs and send it to the tests.
And yet his condition was left undiagnosed.
His health had gradually improved and he had returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was doing sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was introduced into the cavity between the thorax of his chest and the skin of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came a week between Christmas and New Year, "I was told it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mezothelioma diagnostic
Suddenly, Abbott was loaded in a meeting with the nurses Macmillan, one of whom asked him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It appears that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now infected with this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now affecting younger people in non-typical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-free pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many of the staff who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott has often done) almost certainly been exposed to toxic substances.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the prisoners, but a place that threatened the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
The schoolgirls put their Bunsen burners on asbestos trays.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbeste was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of its amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the class for the first time.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolgirls put their Bunsen burners on asbestos substitutes.
Websites have emerged to highlight asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as the floor plate or the roof of the sheds generally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison built in a huge number of our structures," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the demolition of the garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when you sleep with garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"To understand this, it takes quite a while," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's situation.
As an incalculable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused with the amount of information that should have been taken.
"It's hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not meeting Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we support life - the act of breathing itself - that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbeste consists of tiny fibres.
When asbestos is destroyed and fibres inhale, they can be stuck in a plumber, a skin of lungs.
The asbestos fibre is annoying the pellet and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhaling of needle fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who arrived at the May Hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
The trainer knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed by attending the hospital.
When asbestos needles fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treger says, "the hole pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
It's essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
Normal treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, has caused hot disputes.
Some people think it's worth trying.
Trainer doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the plevre," he says.
It's impossible to get around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very good at chemotherapy," which "acts," but doesn't cure.
"From time to time, there are patients who live long" says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became a mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Racow Central," he said vitally when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energyy.
At first, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson did, however, "whistle to give the whole thing a slightly more positive color."
When he met several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazdunski, Professor of Toracal Surgery at Gay Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admitted Graham.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to obtain the best available treatments.
However, when such treatment is inevitably ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern - the future of the families they leave.
And then they apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when we talked about company bad faith.
Andrew Lawson and Gay Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement" according to Morgan, because Lawson couldn't clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gay Hospital.
After investigating his death, a representative of the Gaya Hospital confirmed, however, that "the escape in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers replaced the owner or closed down.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that on their side there is no time for the plaintiffs.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been enacted to facilitate the recovery of compensation for mesothelioma patients, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this Act, a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who is not tried with anyone.
In such cases, the sick will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case - about 1,2000,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with mesothelioma patients, thinks that £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that the amount is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the time period and the mesothelioma patients could track down companies and file a suit in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "implemented."
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during Bill's second reading of mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast 40 per cent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt the tide of strength.
"This, of course, is one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, the state can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went to surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans also showed no trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There was some stains in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things - financials when I die, for example, or what I need to show my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you're not happy.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't survive until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very general and energetic.
She told all her friends, and a lot of people called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even by the opportunity to survive.
This disease carries a dark certainty with itself (even eventually for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to avenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to launch long-standing protests in the Hong Kong business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the declaration.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't fool our expectations, but it still rages," said the legislature, Emily Lowe, the president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
In defending China ' s decision, Lee Faye, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress, said that allowing the popular election of Hong Kong ' s leader would be too "haomatic."
Since 1997, when Britain handed over Hong Kong's control back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to choose a head of government by vote, beginning in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kong the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when one of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place in many years.
Much of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is followed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to close the Hong Kong financial area unless Beijing guarantees true universal suffrage.
Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain before Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving towards a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the protests in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could be taken only if all the opportunities for dialogue had been exhausted and no other choice.
We regret to report that, to date, all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
The government authorities in Hong Kong prepared Beijing for a few days, and security measures involving police and barricade were strengthened on Sunday at Government headquarters.
The unrest is based on the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are becoming weaker under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put the business at risk, a source of Hong Kong's life force.
"The protest they are talking about can cause great economic damage, depending on how many people will be involved and how long" said the legislature Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be concerned that Hong Kong is out of control.
It's a performance that's bad for investment.
Chinese State media have also reported on recent days in which Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown by the Western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American culture of proms goes to university life: first-year students were asked to come on a personal plane.
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first Lux travel service for current students.
In order to give a strong impression of coming to university, the company also offers transport options such as a private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their stuff across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students get to the university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company representative reported that since the service had just been launched, the orders had not yet been issued, but added that "the students would start ordering the service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students needed to pay £9000 a year, it hoped to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes to do.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union criticized this service as being cut off from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NSS for Higher Education, said: "This project appears to be incredibly disabled from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start university studies this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly increasing costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about putting thousands of pounds away for something like a simple arrival in the dormitory.
Feminists raise the question of race and police behaviour after Ferguson.
A unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come up raise their hands by scanning, "Rooks up, don't shoot" while they're waiting in line for funerals.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in connection with the murder of a unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez observed a shift in the Internet among white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminists who had left comments had put the gender above race when it was about promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Pérez saw the responses of white women, who concentrated 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the response of black women soon after the 9 August murder, personal essays with such headlines as "the thought of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin colour and privileges at this high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis we've been facing, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so racial, they felt it had to be pointed out.
For an English professor at Ohio Corita University, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black Americans face every day but who are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I'm gonna get 150 lakes from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how coloured people are being attacked in their own country, silence will be silenced.
"Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships, but not public safety?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women are now bringing together race and gender issues in feminist meinsterim, Angela Hattery, professor of women ' s and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their ancestors did the opposite.
"In between 1865 and 1890, at least 100,000 black men were lichened, and this almost always led to the rape of a white woman," told Hattery.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From the point of view of Hattery, the gap between white and black women occurred when white souffrazists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the struggle for electoral law would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the voice basket for women, and the voice for blacks was supposed to appear later," told Hattery.
Looking back on these things gives us a clear idea of why coloured women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women had won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against vigilantes in the South Women's Association for the Prevention of Lance.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise of reactions by white feminists to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "disturb" problems that black women had dealt with in several generations.
"Yeah, would it be great if activists who have such [traditional feminististic] ideology would also take seriously the right to raise a child, how do they treat the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
The famous white activist of Gloria Steinham's feminist movement, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans participate more in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the views on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys - will be at the head of change" - wrote to Stein.
Although Stinem is being given responsibility for more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, author, "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially coloured young people, were "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's remarches about Ferguson ran counter to the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, "Chartering my brother" to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem moving the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Guard arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border this year, immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she had only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories come back from women's organizations," she said.
The Ipswich House is sold with pigs.
A photograph of a house placed for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a large pig resting in the living room.
The one for sale for £200,000, a separate house with one bedroom, is on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was made of a photograph of the living house, which showed a pig with a head resting on the couch.
The Real Estate Agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo was the home favorite owner of the house.
"Only, the photograph was located by mistake and already removed," the representative of the company informed.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former House of Assembly as a "unique separate house with one bedroom."
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still retained in advertising materials.
The sale of the house has generated an interest in social media, where some have asked if the pig is sold with the house.
The Russian tennis player, Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open, who gave up Caroline Roznitzka, believes that she lacks stability.
According to an athlete, she wants to complete a year and try to get to a new level, handing over Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How do you generally appreciate your results on the Big Scar tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad I managed to win Roland Garros.
With regard to the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the end of some matches.
I'm, of course, upset right now.
I couldn't even reach the quarter-final.
What challenges do you have before the end of the season?
I have a huge motivation to go to a new level after a violent defeat.
I have something to work on, and I'm gonna do everything I can to get this year to a good end.
The Asian tournament series starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the committee of the State Duma on physical culture, sports and youth, a former champion of peace, Nikolai Valouyev, suggested that the standards of the TEAP should be met when entering the university.
He said that, in general, the rules would be the same as those of Soviet times - people would pass the rules of attraction, running and other exercises.
We recall that the 12 constituent entities of Russia will begin to introduce GTO standards in their territory on 1 September.
I also offered to schoolgirls who gave the GTO to give bonus when entering the university - Valouev noted.
For example, you can add some points to the EEG.
There are also proposals to provide additional exit workers to enterprises that have undergone sports tests.
There was a new millionaire in Harvey's town in South Wales after winning the lottery.
It's a game in Harvey's lottery this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire in the southwest of Pert, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery prank on Saturday night.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold to the top prize for the second time in five years, and last win was $1 million in November 2009.
But the lucky winner still needs to speak of himself.
The owner of Steve Forward's shop said that the winnings had caused an agitation in a small town southwest of Pert.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from West Australia celebrated the main prize last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million win for a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and has reported that the winnings have given them the opportunity to travel around the world and to buy a new house.

Mineconomy wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, Mineconomy will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia to the Government, told the deputy director of the department of the Ministry of Oleg Plunik on the round table held by the "Vedestity" at the Moscow Highway 2014.
The plan was prepared on the instructions of the Government and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September and early October, says Plunikov, the measures proposed relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas motor fuel vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy of which is available from the "Vedomotes") is intended for 2014-2017.
Criteria should be developed for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs measures to support the electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessionary credit and concessional leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of machines, stimulating localization and building the service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, regulations are expected to be amended to facilitate the construction of a charge infrastructure (in parks, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to the regional authorities during 2015 proposals that they also encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, proposals to increase the State's procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economination will, by October 2014, introduce criteria on the list of indicators for assessing the performance of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The Russian electric vehicle market is still being formed, with about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, import duties on electric vehicles were imposed, so sales would amount to about 500 grand, predicting the Chief Executive Director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric vehicles any visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial cars were sold.
So far only Mitsubishi Motors has been imported into Russia by electric vehicles.
Renault is being prepared to start imports, primarily targeting corporate clients, and the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships Renault in Russia, Nicolas Remiz, says.
Most of the other electric transport producers have taken a wait-and-see position for Russia.
The Russian manufacturers also have electric vehicles, "GAZa, " but the production of mess.
For example, in January and July 2014, AuttoVAZ released 30 electric vehicles according to ASM Holding.
The demand is low because of the expensive electric vehicles, and the director of AvtoWAZ, in the engineering of Sergei Amanov, won't have a breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian electric vehicle market, in addition to the expensive machinery (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average, twice the cost of analogues with internal combustion engines) inhibits the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (refueling units), sighs the director of the Autostata Sergey of the Cycles.
Owing to the expensive and low rate of reduction in the cost of electric vehicles in the next three to four years, they will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicting the editor-in-chief of the Austorevu Mikhail Potravansky, the Celics agree with it.
On the contrary, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the value of conventional vehicles.
The Russian electricity market has good prospects, and it is important to make consumers sure that "electronic mobility" is real; this will, inter alia, contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rosetti State Company: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a fuelling network are also ongoing with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sophiin, Director of the Rossety Department, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles with different brands.
In addition, Rosetti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure is to support the formation in Russia of a market for electric vehicles to force customs duties.
The zero rate will continue until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and extending the concession list is being explored.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environmental (idea discussed and concerned all machines) would also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, considered Pankov.
Russia ' s transport tax is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles, now accounting for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for auto owners, such as free parking in the centre of the city (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov's confidence, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles across the designated strips, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
The Piper PA-46 aircraft crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, handing over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred several kilometres from the runway of Denver Airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, they deal with the captives of the Donbass battalion.
Cars were surrounded by Iloway.
They were loyal to their own commanders, and dozens of soldiers died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was really like in the south-east of Ukraine, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The drivers from the Donbass battalion were still alive after the "boiler" in which they fell under Iloway.
In the vicinity of the Donetsk army of the People ' s Republic, the militants spent several days actually abandoned by their commanders and authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to get out of the "student" corridor, the column moved.
But in just a few minutes from all sides, the shells and bullets were hanging.
"On the basis of the information given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave, " explains and, uh, the deputy battalion commander with the call "Lermonts."
And when we went down between Mopol and Chervonoselski, crossfire began with anti-tank controlled missiles, with "gears," 30-millimeter grenades, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, leaving only two cars behind.
The officer with the call "Lermonts" says that nearly 60 people died immediately, dozens were injured, many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by those they came to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders had actually deceived them and condemned them to return their death.
We were betrayed simply, they say.
Colonna, the entire battalion to destroy it.
In the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered because Ukrainian news told us about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by separatists.
Alexei's already seen a different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me there was a mortar fire, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, saying one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't released from Ilowayska, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, I've already written a report about leaving.
We were taken directly to Ilowaysk from the Zurahos.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cott" under Iloway.
Some survivors now recognize that if time could be reversed, they would never have joined the punitive battalion.
All of the captured militias handed over to the militias of the NPD.
Everybody's gonna check for war crimes.
A food price control headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyarsk province, which will, if necessary, limit the increase in the price of products in the region ' s market.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the province Government, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural production in the province.
Will the economy cost Rosefti's Kiev $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the shelling of the Lishcan NPP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported that in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage of $140 million and we will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation," said Cechin.
According to him, the introduction of a modified Lishcan NHP was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, no "exploded rebels," but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technology oil buried in the pipes was missing, he said.
We recall that on 18 July, a storage tank was burned in connection with the shelling of the Lisican NIP and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lishcan NDR is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of the plant was introduced in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisician NHP is about 7 million tons of petroleum raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce the fuel standard "Euro4" as well as the diesel shipments of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisbon NIP were suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start repairing the plant.
After a year, Rosnephte received the Lisican NPP, along with other Ukrainian assets of the R&D TNCs.
The DPRK launched a small-range missile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, which is located on the North Korean and China border.
As the Interfax told in the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff, the missile allegedly fell into the Japan Sea after flying about 220 kilometres.
Rubl falls against the backdrop of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew by 3 cops to 37.15 roubles, and the ruble fell to a bivalanary basket against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions.
The ETS prices for the dollar started transactions at 37.11-37.2 roubles/$1, an average of 37.16 roubles/$1 per two minutes, is 4 cops higher than the previous closure level.
The euro was 48.79 roubles per euro, which is 3 cops higher than the previous closure.
The cost of the bivalinal basket was increased by 3.5 cops, to 42.395 roubles.
The United States dollar sells 23 cops higher than the official rate, the euro 16 cops higher than the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there were no panics this time.
I kept cheap and rubbish, and I even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now in advance of the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like artificial hysterics going through the media, especially the western ones.
There are not many options for introducing new sanctions to the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the bivalinal basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negativity in the near future, Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be tried with Ideal Tour.
A total of 4.7 billion rubles were filed by the Orenburg Airlines with Ideal Tour.
These are two cases to be held in October.
The cases will be dealt with by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's just over 425 million rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting was scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union of the Tourism Industry, judges have been appointed in different cases.
In July, information on Ideal Tour's debt to Orenburg Avilias, amounting to 1.5 billion rubles, appeared in the media.
Viktor Zukin's air manager is talking about 1.6 billion rubles.
The CEO of the Aeroflota, Vitaly Savellev, calls an additional sum of two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to get more interesting for new users.
Twitter microblog service changed the process of user registration to engage new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandoned their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now be viewed during the registration process by a large number of recommended accounts in order to complete their reading cycle immediately.
The recommendations are prepared on the basis of the interests identified in the registration process.
In doing so, Twitter automatically sets a subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
This will require the user to take his own hands off the elbows in order not to read those who are not interested in him.
If users of the microblank service have previously seen only avatars of recommended users, Twitter now leads a sample of one of the popular Twitters of the blogger to help make the impression of the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been actively working to modernize the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continued effort of the service to achieve infinity.
In 2014, the microblank service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in the activity of readers.
The company is currently desperately in need of a larger number of loyal consumers who would have stayed for a long time once.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be chilly and rainy.
In the Moscow region, the first September will be cool and rainy all day, reporting meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Podmoskowje, 13 to 18 degrees.
The rain will be rained in the rain cloud, with the wind of the east quarter, with only 3 to 8 meters per second.
Vehicle recycling programme resumed on 1 September
The vehicle recycling programme is being renewed in Russia on 1 September.
Until 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The program will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The compensation will range from 40,000 per light car to 350,000 rubles per cargo.
A similar vehicle recycling programme had already been in place in Russia.
The main difference of the current project was explained by the Minister that it was now envisaged not only to dispose of the vehicles to receive a subsequent discount, but also that if the vehicle reached the age of more than six years, it would be possible to purchase a new one with a discount when the old one was handed over to the dealer, it would transfer the Interfax.
Over 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling programme, from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, the level of car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent in relation to 2009).
The Creator Coming Out Simulator will release the game of modern journalism.
Geimdinener Nikki Case, known as Coming Out Simulator, decided to release the game of modern journalism.
He described his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it's only now well known.
A source of inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the information coverage of stories affects their effects.
A game hero, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what's going on in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what's going on, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protesters are gangsters, the police will be better able to treat him and let him go where the usual person can't go.
If he does not cover events differently, his photos can turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will have to be drawn by a hero Twitterer, where new subscribers will appear if the pictures are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of the exit and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event could change depending on how a photograph of it was made and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Keyes explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game a long time ago, but initially wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip rather than protests in the United States.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw media covering events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on account of what had happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer that produces browser games.
The most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events from Case's own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletei drags Ukraine into further bloodshed.
In calling for another "ten thousand" victims, the Ukrainian Defence Minister Valery Geletei is bringing the people into further bloody confrontation, as stated in a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valeria Gelethea, stating that "the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the Great National War, in which the losses would be estimated at "ten thousand."
The adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, a subject for non-military research, is stated in a communication from Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On informal channels, the Russian side has threatened several times that, if resistance continues, they are prepared to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that "the operation to release the east of Ukraine" had been completed.
Hilton's transfer removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 stars of Hollywood were horrified.
The hackers hacked the primitive passwords into the iCloud (data warehouse) in the smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Really, it won't be long.
We recall that Jennifer Lawrence, the official representative of the Blue Games star, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and confirmed that all images that "shish" in the Network are genuine.
Hilton, the creator of a single website, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues in the church for publishing their candid pictures, writes The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm gonna delete the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justis, wrote the blogger on Twitter.
However, all frank pictures of the stars have already spread over the Network.
David Beckham got into a traffic accident hiding from paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident fleeing paparazzi.
It happened in L.A. at the corner of Bulvar Sanset.
The British footballer was shot and removed by the right hand muscle.
Beckham came out of the tattoo salon where paparazzi was waiting for him.
By slipping away from their persecution on a motorcycle, he failed to turn around and fell, writes TMZ with a reference to sources close to the football player.
In the end, Beckham got the bruise, the muscle stretching of the right hand and the scratch.
Tony Stuart is losing his accident by returning to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track is a little more than in the middle of the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart crashed into the wall a second time after his right front tyre crashed 172 laps, putting an end to his appearance.
Stuart took his slutty car to the garage and then went out without talking to reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said 14 team members were upset, but now they'll focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and I hope we can do better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier on the race Sunday night after a clash with Kyle Bush, demanding repair of his right side of the car.
"I started today with a rather great hope of coming to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "Just failed."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded on the evacuation, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car was hit and killed by another driver during a race on the land highway in the north of New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the Precinct.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed Kevin Ward Junior, 20 years old, who went on the road to express dissatisfaction with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
It was not decided whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud voices and applause when he was introduced before the race.
Starting from position 12, Stuart walked at the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching position four.
Then there's 122 laps after W. Bush's restart.
The 18th car went off the trajectory at the exit of direction 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but he's gone to the 21st position.
Sobchak and Whitorgan are eating cigarettes with Zwanecki in Odessa.
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Whitorgan are now in Odessa, which the television director did not have the privilege of reporting to his Instagrams.
True, one photograph was very surprised and embarrassed by the couple's fans.
It's taken from Zwaneck.
"At the breakfast of Mikhail Michael Mikhalich Zwanecki Maxim explains what an instagram is:) #odessa," signed a photograph of Xenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no butter or anything...
The couple's followers decided Xushu's smoking, too, and condemned her for that.
"Whose cigarettes?, "Crucination kills!" "Some cigarette breakfast," "It's like breakfast, and only cigarettes on the table") " " "Csenia, you smoke too?" excited for their favorite blog subscribers.
Remember, recently, Sobchak boasted about what a delicious dinner Maxim Whitorgan had made her for the first time in his life.
"Happy is when you come to the duck, and your husband made dinner for your arrival." He boasted about his husband Xenia Sobchak.
The picture shows that Maxim's doing something hard, and the table has salts and chicken.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria protested to the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Wage increases are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Interim Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, officers protested symbolically against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison union met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
The negotiations are ongoing, and the head of the Directorate General for Corrections, Rosen Jeliazkov, has been informed by the BPR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the prison union protest.
The Army controls the new Thai Government
General Pryat (right) appointed the Minister of Defence, Edith Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Pryat Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers of the country, in which more than one third of the posts were held by generals or generals in resignation.
The army has received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Pryat Chan-Ocha was formally approved as Prime Minister following the official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government to the post.
The 60-year-old military, who took over power in the country as a result of a bloody coup on 22 May, was the only candidate for the Prime Minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Pryatya Chan-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglac Chinawat.
Officially Pryat Chan-Ocha will be a temporary premier, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, it is feared that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army replaced Brother Yinglijk Chinawat Taxin as Prime Minister.
Both have been popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has often succeeded in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one ever said it would be better in the medium salad, and I didn't promise you that, and a waitress from Palm's new brassery would send you out.
I have to formally admit that that's true, but minds and stomachs remain constant.
Everybody's known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - meaning mydium, we say "Midia" - meaning "Belgium."
Restorators like to say deeply that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that aren't good, even great, but some bad luck.
Anyway, when I sat at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a City Café (in honor of that TV show), then Odessa Mama, and a Bojole restaurant and a beer friendship.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed on the ground: a bar stand and a couple tables, and all the rest of the space was missing even a hint of sunshine.
But it's funny, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, different color chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have been out of date for a long time, so comparing it with something.
There are eight kinds of beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-150 rubles).
The company-positive waitress presents the menu funnyly by telling us that "Midia are the big seed" and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected by execution.
Well, for example, it's given to guess that a bunny roll with a gallon prune (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio cut in the same thin as the pergament paper over it would appear to be insanely thick.
You can only feel some kind of taste if you warm up the shelf.
It's worse with salads.
Classic liquor (260) would be the most appropriate offence against the Belgian people: some squeaky iceberg, once cooked a long time ago with a potato, throwing down Kenyan beans, obsessed chips from bacon plus some kind of marinian onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a league salad!
The composition of Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If you could still close your eyes on the starving quarters of the tomato worms or the roast champignons, then why do the media look like they've been frozen and cooked a few times in their lives!
'Cause I already know there's a perfectly normal white mime here!
They're served in "in the sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen souss, the one from white wine, celery and carrots, didn't come out frankly.
There are vegetables, and there's no scent, and there's no wine there, and there's no mystery.
But they're pretty good at the Fries with the house mayonnaises.
Chicken vatersis here is not a hangover, thick to such a extent that depending on the mood, you can decide whether the first or the second dish is in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit of a local cook was cooking in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about pink.
Turns out the situation was diametrically opposite: the pysmarin caught everything.
It seemed that this rabbit had been fed exclusively by pimarinous bushes in life, and that meat had acquired such an extraordinary scent.
But the rabbit's knife was accompanied by a wonderful one - no, just a pear in a caramelized crust.
The Palm waffles offer not only sweet but also dry - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informal in asking for the lunch impressions.
So we should come again.
The dollar has risen to MMB above 37 rubles on news about new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar of "morrow" by 10:29 msk grew by 26.9 spears and was 37.02 roubles, and the euro was raised by 30 spears, up to 48.73 roubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The pool grew at 28 spears to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 roubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its peak on 19 February 2009, at 36.43 roubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was 37.005 roubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is a long-term one, a couple of euros, and a pair of dollars.
The long-term forecast was based on this note, " says Senior Alpari analyst Anna Bodorov.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the course in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, the rumours of the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All the talk about him being resistant to such news was reversed yesterday.
The week is projected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, gas transit through Ukraine are all part of the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to spread: the current prices for the autumn will increase from 5 to 10 per cent.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruit will end soon, and a vacuum will emerge while networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dallar came to mark 37 rubles, went through it and returned back, some powerful hysterical, " comments the Chief of Market Analysis, Open Broker, Constantin Bushouyev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
Ruble, he said, was severely weakened after the end of the tax season, followed by news about Ukraine, and the CB last week stated that by the end of the year, it was fully moving towards a floating course and refusing any currency intervention.
If you look at the day-to-day, it was nothing different from the previous one during this month, scared everyone of the 37 rubles mark, and the analyst continues.
Well, there's nothing powerful about trafficking.
The worrying times for the foreign exchange market were, I will recall, when the demand for currency increased at the end of January, as well as the third March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of weakening the rubbish.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue of export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import prices, says the Chief Analyst, UFS IC, Alexei Kozlov.
The price of imported goods and services can be attributed to negative developments.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency have significantly reduced the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, fuelled inflationary pressures and, as a result, contributed to the cost of borrowing money, which in turn hampers the development of the economy.
In terms of the stock market, the depreciation of the rubbish slightly reduces the prices of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMB index declined by 1.67% during the Thursdays, while the RTS index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative decline in indices is due to a reduction of more than 1.5 per cent over the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy currency.
The practice has shown that emotions are gradually declining, and the rubrics are partially or completely recovering the lost items.
"We believe that we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexi Kozlov.
Genetic abuse is often misdiagnosed
Britanca reported that she spent years thinking she would die after a misdiagnosed diagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her teenage age thinking she had only a few years living after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Sharco-Marie Tout's disease, a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK reported that the misdiagnosed diagnosis was a common problem among people with STIs because so little is known about this state.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have a SMT that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure walk and burning toes.
The sick may feel numbness or pain, and the state does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought that she was suffering from the attack of Friedreich (AF), a condition for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said, "I knew I couldn't do what others were doing.
I fell down every day, and it took me more time.
I've never been able to ride rollers or skateboard with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries, to free achille tendon and put her feet straight, she looked into the medical records when her doctor got out of her room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because the sounula wasn't supposed to be, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote it to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked to experience the worst panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this intersect.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you're having this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you've got something that's much less a threat to life.
After a few genetic tests, she found a SMT.
"When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I pulled a happy ticket," she said.
The British SMTS has announced a month of information about the SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington Area entrepreneurs is increasing as the economy recovers.
A revitalized economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies throughout the country increased moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone did not exclude them.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined US$27.6 billion in state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the US$ 26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and local level increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after successive years of decline in the accounts in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernest & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the county, 56 per cent, are from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland tax revenues are from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the least tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is due to the return to the continued value of the company ' s real estate, according to researchers, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when growth was less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these revenues are owed to large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is true in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent over the previous year.
However, the observed return of real estate value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and August Colombia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around August Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has much more to rely on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the restoration of the real estate market.
Business income also appears to be adjusted according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income tax revenues, most of them in the region.
While trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same speed in all three locations.
The growth rate in Columbia County was at the same level as the average country, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was much faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia experienced a rise in tax revenues below the average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high - 9,975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, lower taxes for public and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for business taxes than in Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, just as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet tax revenue targets next year, the law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington Zone seems to feel better and thus pays more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid as individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure whereby most small firms - in Columbia, Maryland and Virginia County - grew by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with much higher growth rates than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in revenue from business taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a turnover tax from state and local governments increasing by 6.2 per cent over the first three quarters of 2014, compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind because the decline in federal spending has an impact on the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of the Russian Judo
The world's home championship for judo brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia's team.
According to this indicator, only Japan's main championship of the competition was assigned to Russians.
The tournament in Chelabinski started on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who was in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal fight against Baldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one observation received by Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia's team - on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In men ' s competitions, up to 66 kg of silver came to Mikhail Pulaev and the bronze to Kamalu Khan-Magomadova.
In the final battle, the Russians lost the 2011 and 2013 World Championship to the Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomadov, a quarter-final loser of a compatriot, won the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category, up to 52 kg also reached the third step of the pedestal.
In the semi-finals, she lost the current World Championship of Milend Kelmendi from Kosovo, which at that championship was under the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
In the argument for the Kuzutin armor, she won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament, she admitted that the third place wasn't what she was counting on.
And once again, Kelmendi, who had won Kusutina in the final of the European Championship, was a barrier to the Russians to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze in a copy of Russia's team put Musa Mashkov in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, the former representative of Moldova, Viktor Skovortsov, now in charge of the AAE team, became an insult.
But then the Russian won two contractions and became the winner of the award.
The muffins were at a home championship with a holenostope trauma he was planning to heal soon, so he'd take a pause in the competition.
As for the ex-molden Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal on the tournament.
It is interesting that another member of his compatriot, who accepted the sports citizenship of OAE, Ivan Remarenko and the bronze, completed his statement in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of CM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Niphontes in the category of up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of a small finale, he won Frenchman Schmitt with a comment from the rival.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but Russians traditionally restricted themselves to one bronze in a male tournament to 90 kg.
Her owner was Kirill of the Questions, and Russia's team was guaranteed this medal: his rival for the consolation finale was the compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, there was no contraction: the contestant of the Question was unable to reach the Tatami because of the injury.
The man's armor was won by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, she was coated by Renat Saidov, who was in the category of over 100 kg.
In a comforting final, he won a clean victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
The individual part of the world ' s originality has thus ended.
On the last day of the Chelyabinsk tournament, Sunday, the world's championships were played in command competitions.
Both Russian teams - both male and female - were among the main applicants for the award, but as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
The Russian judoists won the command silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they fought hard against the 2-3 account, and they gave up to the main supporters of the competitions, the Japanese team.
At the same time, Russia's team was 2-0 after the net victory of Khan Magomedov and the volley - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their rivals in Japan.
In the same scenario, a bronze match in a women's tournament was developed, where the Russian team took 2-0 to give up Japanese 2-3.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin attended the command competitions in Chelyabinsk, who, after the tournament, congratulated the men's silver team.
"The second place is very honourable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could be champions, " said Putin, the words of which are quoted by RIA News.
Losing the Japanese, the Gjudo's relatives, is nothing to be seen here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
Russia's gathering at the World's Home Championships was much better than a year ago at competitions of this level in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals in the Russian team's assets - one silver and two bronzes.
However, the current tournament missed the Olympic Champions of Arsen Galsten and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big macsmalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a man in the Olympic cycle comes into the G-8 of the strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in the form of sports such as Judo, the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation, Vitaly Mutko, who is quoted by the press service of the championship, took stock of the tournament.
Japan's collection was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which were gold.
The next World Championship will take place next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics are available on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers is unconscious of her arrival at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter hoped today that the 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in his statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopicsy, reporting sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under drug abuse and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "hard."
The feedback was broad, including numerous Internet support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everybody's gonna be able to make kings.
The debut album by Royal Blood is the new hope of a British rock that brought rock duets from clubs straight to stadiums.
Royal Blood has only a year on stage, but already has an active BBC nomination, a tour at Arctic Monkeys, and a visit to a New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album, once more months before the release, received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in Warner Music's Major label portfolio.
In view of the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation from a number of upwards is not the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet chocolate representing the "new R'n'B" but the duo of bulls like Britishs playing with the volume and intensity that was last fashioned a few decades ago.
In general, the rates on the first album for all the above-mentioned circumstances have been particularly high and have already been fully justified.
Dueth didn't take his name, which he could've gotten into before, except for the desperate hairy metalists, and the blood of which kings is leaking, as they think they have in their veins, is understandable.
This is, of course, particularly about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quarter, Royal Blood is trying to shake the blood of the British horn, bringing it to a new height.
Predicting the success of this enterprise is perhaps early, but something can be said.
A decade of songs held in 30 minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's gift, but a strong and strong declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers cannot be denied: let's say the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered not by a melodic line but by a drum party.
Musicians in the joke say this song is even easier to knock than to sing.
It is also worth mentioning the powerful Little Monster, and the closing record of the Better Strangers, with a Sepper quote in the title.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy horns, but when they lose in a row, they'll come into a more or less homogeneous field.
And it doesn't have to be bad, even vice versa.
The power of Royal Blood is that they don't claim the new Lennon and McCartney laures, but they've removed many rock duets from the ghetto indi clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a space of less than a few thousand people, it was obviously close.
The secret is in part in a bass hitch that replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
But it's not just about tools, but it's also about writing songs.
The heroes of the zero-retropical retropical were hard to choose beyond the post-modern paradigm, with a huge reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood is now sounding so powerful and ingrained that it's successfully draining some secondaryity and hardness of music material.
Well, after all, who said the rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online store - and video producer, and another hundred other things - buys a Twitch video broadcast service for $1.04 billion (US$97.0 million).
This news wasn't a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many people expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch to Google video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a flow service of a general nature, a version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their intragame moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitch Interfeis.
And "let's play," the genre of video clippers, in which all the clues give (mainly old) game processing, as in the "Tain Theatre," is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube buys Twitch was met with no special interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted technology company that buys a potential rival.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay at least as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmet Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another mystery, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than to watch it, are hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking a jelly bear into their own hands.
One thing is to look through a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when she goes through Resident Evil, and the other thing is to watch someone else get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Dute.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so looking at them without controlling the angle of view on their own can be a recipe for headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passes in which Rogers Bannisters of our e-century end up playing games on record dates are entertaining.
But if it's not about the virtualism of the game or the humor, it's unlikely that its Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn into Amazon Instant Video just as beautiful as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to receive: the crowds of young men who are dreaming about by the advertisers.
As the head of Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of the games," this channel does not show signs of confusion, even - oh - as a sighting sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to survivors - almost all of the students now, with the parents of the deceased, with the head of the cemetery, Ramón Kaspolatov, the head of the Matheri Beslan Committee, Susana Dodieva, who participated in the special operation by a staff member of the MSS, explains the reporter of the Department of Publicity, Elizabeth Antonov, who worked on a special project.
Already returning to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who was a Presidential adviser on the North Caucasus 10 years ago and engaged in negotiations with terrorists, as well as with an officer of the Russian FBI, Vyacheslav Bocharov.
That I was particularly shocked at the time I was working on this topic is that in Beslan, it's like I haven't been there for ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people are struggling to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan can't be forgotten, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
The speck project has been prepared by the studio infographics of holding Rambler & Co, which has been working for the company since spring this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's tenure.
The DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Japan Sea, reporting Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, located on the North Korean and China border.
Allegedly, the missile fell into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared in the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff.
Members suggested accelerating the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law had been introduced in the State to change the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, effective 1 September 2016, to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislation of the lower chamber.
It was co-sponsored by the deputies of the State Duma, Vadim Daygin, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (the One Russia), Vladimir Parahin (the Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
This change, in the view of the sponsors, will help to ensure more expeditious and effective protection of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to protect personal data and to respect the confidentiality of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, whose entry into force is to be extended to parliamentarians, obliges Russians processed online to keep personal data on Russian territory.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, stockpile, store, refine and extract personal data from Russian citizens in databases located in Russian territory, and to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law empowers Roskomnadzor to limit access to information processed in violation of Russian legislation in the field of personal data by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offenders' websites, an automated information system called "The Register of Perpetrators of Personal Data."
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Daygin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of RCF.
Money and Yushchenko are also one of the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have a date centre in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill before the State today, the first title of the Thought Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he did not see problems in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that would not have their own personal data storage facilities in Russian territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, by Rostelcoma, who had repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and already provide their servers, by Mail Group, to Western companies that were already providing their servers.
"In addition, there are several independent date centres willing to cooperate in this field," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work in the Russian Federation, there are no problems - they will be given technological space for accommodation," Levin concluded.
Dispute Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that, if the bill was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the law-draft deprives individuals of the right to dispose of their own data, it is imperative to determine that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation."
RACK ' s statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a user information mechanism on where it is recorded and to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose the territory in which the action will be taken.
The adoption of such draft laws on "localization" of personal data in other countries has resulted in the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
Ice water blew out the jaw.
Isabel Roberts was yelling at her head with ice water, which damaged the bone structure of her face.
It's a test of ice water that's gone wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she yelled so much during a test by an ice water blazing her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts yelled so loudly when the ice water was poured on her head, which damaged her face structure.
"Water was so cold that I yelled, but when I did it, my jaw started to get stuck," she said The Mirror.
Water is pouring for 20 years.
Isabel Roberts just a second before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but it wasn't shut, it was stuck, and then it came to me that something was wrong.
Then my mom and my sister got the same understanding and they started hunting, but I had to get to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to a hospital to fill the jaw after having been involved in a popular engagement on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet Sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
More than 400 prisoners were handed over by the police to the Ukrainian military
In the Novorossia Army, it is alleged that the Ukrainian Su-27 was shot down and the enemy is accused of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As at 10:00 on 1 September, 402 prisoners were handed over to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were injured, as well as 35 killed soldiers.
The representative of the Press Service of the Army of Novorossia informed the Interfax.
He added that "the air force in the Mereki district was hit by a Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire."
According to the agency ' s interlocutors, the Ukrainian side used proscribed international conventions cluster munitions in artillery shelling at Lugan airport.
The spokesman for the press noted that the militia had been able to damage two helicopters of Ukrainian Air Force during the night at one of the field airfields, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The casualties of the enemy - up to 100 people killed and wounded, surrendered to 13 persons," was summarized by the staff representative.
Interfax does not have evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced that 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine had been handed over to the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the NPD army, according to Army Novorossia, "has stopped an attempt by the Nazis, in violation of previous agreements, to remove heavy equipment from the area."
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops in the ambulance.
According to the headquarters, the overall losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during that night were five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 persons killed and injured
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by militias in the Ilowayska area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
In the NPD, they agreed to do so on condition that the enemy hand over arms and ammunition.
The first dozens of troops began to leave surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to a commander surrounded by a Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbass, Semen Semenchenko, another 14 people left the "Cotla" on Sunday night.
On his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were "in captivity at 137 regiment 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation" where they were treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO concerning the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation: Russia will respond to new sanctions imposed by the EU
Russia reserves the right to respond to the protection of its legitimate interests if new anti-Russian sanctions are imposed, and reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A communication from the Russian Foreign Department states that the "conclusions" of the European Council, dated 30 August, demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome inertia in their unheated support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country" on the website of the agency.
The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is influenced by countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for a full-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties" , stressed the agency.
It is also noted on the agency ' s website that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has begun, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
We recall that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
In doing so, EU representatives work closely with United States officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced for the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New European Union sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Easy ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $10,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon go to second grade, has come up with a clever way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to borrow books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My book on mathematical analysis, which usually cost $180, I got on a semester for $10 and a cookie for "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is studying at the College of Georgia.
The necessary literature on the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Council of Colleges, the average student spends more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet magasmines and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The collection of books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and is often much cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookshops were hired during the last spring semester, says Vice-President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookshops, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores."
Here's the introductory course on the best way to make a good deal.
Buying online magasin
Sometimes if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see at the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler is worth about $290 on the Preiscrant, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.

If you don't mind someone else's markings or injuries, the books you used are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in excess of Chegg.com.
Matt Kesadey, 25 years old, a fourth-year student from Brigham Young University, says he paid for Amazon.com 42 cents for a delayed copy of the book "Strategical solutions in the media: Understanding the business side of the advertising business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College without Walls at Massachusetts University in Emhurst, invite students to specify from their professors whether previous publications could not be used.
Sometimes updating is irrelevant for study.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small portion of the value of the latest publication.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, belonging to eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rations
It's worth thinking about taking the textbooks for hire if you treat them well enough, don't forget to return them, and don't want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 per cent of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a Mathematical Analysis for a semester of about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you can write for the marks, the markings and the damage.
If you rent the book, remember, if you don't return the book, the fines can even exceed the value of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes, such books are hired by acquiring an electronic licence for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" project on Chegg.com will cost about $61.
Brady says that students studying literature can often find the best prices because many classical works can now download free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Gold, 29 years old, who's gonna start studying at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using ISBN to find the price of the book, because it guarantees that you're looking for the text you need.
Before making an order on the Internet, Gold says you have to check if the book is actually in the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn that lesson.
The delivery of the book he bought was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid a full price at the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the far East development fund was completely ineffective.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, called at the meeting on support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remain on deposits," stressed by the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the list of pre-development Territories in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the THOs should be submitted to the State in the autumn.
The Federal Assembly noted by the President that until 1 July the list of pre-development territories in the Far East and their criteria had never been approved.
Vladimir Putin also set the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s transport accessibility, removing infrastructure restrictions, both on the domestic market and on export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create opportunities to attract additional investment in the region, as well as to create areas of advanced development that should be competitive with key APC business centres, and the President stressed.
Remember, it has previously been reported that the pre-development area could replace the EEZ.
Why "Galactic Straights" couldn't save cash charges
Sylvaster Stallone's "Indeed 3" returned less than $30 million of their $90 million budget in the United States, while "City of sins: a woman who should be killed" returned only $12 million from her $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's home video only brought $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films, such as "How to Hand Dragon 2," also disappoint the profit.
The article on telegraph Robbie Collin's film shows that when it comes to children's films, it may be the bad quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the worst year in history with children's films, and called "How to Handle Dragon 2" a barely "functional" follow-up to Fentasi.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily a film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film, which took at least 2,000 copies in the summer between the May and 20 July Memorial Day celebration, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of both film viewers and film critics, suggest that this year ' s film harvest is similar in size to last year ' s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing visual habits and the growing popularity of stream Internet services, such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on the film "The Book of the Jungle" that is about to be sold, said to Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times change."
We have to admit it and not try to chase for what happened before.
Unlike the current collapse of the Hollywood cash charges, Netflix's revenue from the flux reproduction service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for putting too much reliance on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "Black."
In the light of the current recession, some commentators claim that his dark predictions had a share of truth.
As several potential cash hits are expected to come out in the summer of 2015, including the "Holders: Ers Altrona," the "Minyons" and the "Jur Park," other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
The producer "People X" Simon Kinberg recently called the drop of cash charges just "cyclical" by saying Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of institutions with Caucasus and Middle Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan's kitchen, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, it is generally common to replace prohibited imports of products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a small cucumber better than a bad mozzarella," the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio is down on the quality of cheese offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italians.
Mozartella and the burrat cheese ended at the restaurant first, they have a small storage period.
Parmesan's supplies should be enough for a few more months.
What do I do?
Moving on to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomel market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes as to make it clear that shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat was on the carts only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said we'd never buy anything in Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe it's changed right now.
But the other day, I got a fish sample from the Far East.
So she turned out to be dumb!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of Italy's usual things are for a Russian producer in the dikovin.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in a cold cell for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It's got to hang out to make it soft so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?
I said it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you guys do that?
In five minutes of walking from Barlotti at the French restaurant Brassierie Bridge, the kitchen has a stoplist showing missing products: French oysters, sea grease.
The Bressierie Bridge restaurant chef and the Strolk bar Regis Trigel are not as pessimical as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheese, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Trust cappust is 200 rubles!
I'm saying, "Why is it worth so much on what basis?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
Long-range oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know how much their pancier weighs?
The price is that it's superdelicacy.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of carpentry for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what's gonna happen when they're finished.

Sanctuary menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly referred to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and sub-products from poultry, meat delicates, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, makeup, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.
The restaurants have started to have a charade with suppliers: food prices have increased, and there is an urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with a monopoly on France, Italy, Spain, to which products have been supplied directly from the "motherland" countries.
The community has had to rebuild before.
For example, when in early 2014 Rosselhoznadzor banned the importation of Australian beef and a year earlier American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers established the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer 2014 were far more severe.
Indeed, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the Presidential Decree, which outlawed the boys of Atlantic salmon and trout, non-ltactose milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can be further mitigated.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in an uncertain environment.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imports in the bonus segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce, " says Sergei Mirons, editor, owner of the RedConsalt agency.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we don't have very few cooks like this, and a new menu can take two or three months.
The trigel from the Bressierie Bridge restaurant is ready to do this: we're gonna have to give up 10-15% of the food, half of the menu to rework.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, they're beginning to replace dishes, such as steak from marble beef, befstroganes, says Sergei Mironov.
"Sirs from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," listed the representative of East West Oksana Glibchuk.
Plums and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by chickens from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway, salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of European vegetables and fruit can be compensated by domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants would be easier than the premium segment: it was unlikely that the gourmans who were able to distinguish Italian Mozartella from the Russians would go there.
Although it's hard to have Ginza Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and menus.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace," Mirons says.
In Ginza, the comments were rejected, citing the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of the cafeteria of the Caucasus and the Middle Asian kitchen emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are richer than Europeans.
But there's a lot of restaurants that aren't gonna touch the sanctions.
These include institutions from the CIS countries ' kitchens: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in the Georgian kitchen, " says Hatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi, and the vai Mei Café.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, based on many dishes - chicken pillows, exotic greens we don't use."
At Kolbai's facilities, no meals have yet been removed from the menu.
Timura Lanny, the owner of China N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, sanctions are also not embarrassing: it will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
The LPG can be cheaper to get a cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
The Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish like that.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Olimba Artivov, stated that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan expressed their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fastfood restaurants that responded to the request by Deneg are also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
McDonald's news service stated that localization exceeded 85 per cent and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, the head of the Department for Subway Russia's suppliers, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties in supplying vegetables and increasing prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In "Tremka" the "sancation products" were not more than 4 per cent at all.
They didn't touch the sanctions or the Wokker noodles.
KFC, Burger King and Potochka did not respond to the request for Deneg, but other market participants claim that Burger King's location is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restorators are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian Far Easter
On his mustard.
In the meantime, the restorators complain that price increases even for local products as a result of increased demand.
"The Grabley groceries price increased by an average of 10-15 per cent, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio, twice, " says Restor Roman Rozhnikovski.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dish will increase by 5-10%, and Kolbai recognizes it.
East West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have been worth between 10 and 15 per cent since early August."
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised the prices of pork almost twice, " complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Chicken guts cost 35 per cent.
We're waiting for China's prices, maybe they're gonna lose Brazil's hot heads.
The target price increase of 8 per cent in Stardogs will be in the near future.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Rak.
According to statistics, the increase in the earnings of the general public in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
The pink prices will continue to rise, he recognizes, but it is not clear how fast it is: as long as most of the restorators have spent their products for the next two months in the hope of relapsing procurement prices.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
There are ten tents in front of Moscow City Hall, decorated by green and tree.
At the center of the scene, musicians play Vals.
It's a regional food festival with a fun name, "There's time."
"We've been going to make a local food party for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we're hurrying, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
After the stage with Greek musicians, Anastas is preparing a salad from the macaroni and home candy, and there was a master class in the day to make a fight against caramelized apples.
All Russian products, they assure the organizers.
It is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people ' s economy.
Bashkirya honey, a deer from Salehard, vegetables from Lenin's underwear, cheese from J. Clouse's skinned Italian.
"Lose for restaurants can be replaced peacefully by other fish salmon from the Far East, " says the owner of the fish shop, "Your People," Philip Galkin.
We've got nerves, ketu, bowels, peas, teasing, queen salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because it's wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hands, he doesn't even move.
And we can't hold our long-range salmon.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian Mozartella with national
His tent's intriguing is a shrimp with a "Magadan" berch, a track, a omul, a muxun, a midia with Crimea, a fucking thing from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's time to go to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 were over 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish went to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
Your People's Love has been working since 2012, selling fish via the Internet store, servicing another 1.5 dozen restaurants, such as simple things, prior to the imposition of sanctions.
It's now 15 more restaurants that have been applied for to Galkin.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, it's hot.
We're freezing, we've tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi via the Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper a few times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared for the Philadelphia with the keta.
Unlike the rock rolls, they have to eat longer, but the knowledge that this fish is ours, ours, ours, ours, their strength.
There's even rolls of paletus and sea cucumber on the website of the "Your People" shop.
In sushi bars, it is true that a Norwegian salmon is preferred by Chile.
Galkin explains that the cooks are lying to make new recipes with far-eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitri Evesev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take the free niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-leader of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America are now being replaced.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly import banned imports, unlike our farmers.
I mean, the ban will be won primarily by the major producers of other countries," Akimov says.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than product sanctions.
As a result of the massive extraordinary inspections, the operation of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg was temporarily suspended.
"We're looking at the essence of the claims to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of visitors' restaurants," stated "Dengam" in the McDonald's press service.
No one really knows what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says, on the basis of anonymity, a staff member of the restaurant consulting company.
If you start closing McDonald's all over the country, then the script will be completely different.
Europrotocol instead of HYDL
Cosco payments could be made without a HYDAD certificate, so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of "europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidelines that, since 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain payment for the casco.
This is true only when the accident was performed on a "europrotocol" without the participation of the road police.
So if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, no damage exceeded the limit and both drivers agreed on who caused the accident.
Since 2 August, the limit for Europrotocol payments is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that, often even with minor injuries, in situations where accidents can be processed by "europrotocol," drivers who have been involved in an accident cause DFS.
It was not possible to obtain compensation without a certificate from HYDDD if a cosco polysco was available.
The parameters described in the draft directive are precisely intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of "europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum lump sum for accidents performed without HICD staff should not be lower than the limit for "europrotocol."
However, it cannot be higher than the limit set out in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DFS and the roads.
But she's probably not gonna get excited about cars or insurers.
The latter are now talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may result in the introduction of new payment rules for kasco.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will most often wait hours for the inspector to make a small accident because it's so reliable.
It is also not known that it will be easier to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of Europrotocol.
A savings certificate will make it available and unsolicited
Minfin wants to ban savings certificates on the bearer, but he's gonna let banks make them an analog of unsolicited contributions.
Minphin is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates on the bearer.
The tool has recently gained popularity, as the stakes are higher than bank deposits.
In fact, savings certificates on the bearer do not enter the deposit insurance system, and the bank costs less because it does not have to contribute to the contribution insurance agency (AFS) fund.
The situation is that this step is planned for small and medium-sized banks issuing such certificates and will be affected by Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated to control 98 per cent of the relevant market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated to have a share of about 3.5 per cent.
The problem is that the customers of a small bank buying such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the ASA if the license is withdrawn.
Some investors, without having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for the bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
Based on the lack of insurance payments for these certificates, if the licence is withdrawn from the bank, it may lead to misunderstanding and social tensions.
In the agency's practice, there were cases in which the bearer certificate holders attempted to recover insurance compensation through the court," stated to the AU.
The problem, of course, is imaginary.
After all, no one would pay certificates to buyers because they had no legal right to reimbursement from the State.
If the matter were to be that the instrument was not insured in the AU, it would also prohibit metal accounts with which citizens ' funds are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one has yet attempted to exist.
It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient price paper, which can actually be a quasi-deneg.
Their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand over to any citizen, and before such a certificate is available, many owners may change it.
It is not an accident that the draft law states that a savings certificate must be necessarily a price paper that must be kept in depositaries.
In order to enjoy the pill, banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.
So, there's an analogue of unsolicited contributions that the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nüport and Cardiff
The weekend was marked by protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff's center for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclaus followed the events for us during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from everywhere, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter terrorist groups of the Islamic State, reports on 31 August to the ITAR-TASS, referring to the decision taken following the meeting of representatives of the Government of the FRG, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement to the Bundestag on this subject.
To date, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the residents of the FRG on the sending of weapons to Iraqis have been divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the Islamic State fighters, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia attacked a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donet militia attacked a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
According to the available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of wide and unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupola).
A number of Ukrainian media report the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It turns out that the incident took place around 4:20 msk today.
Teenagers were taken on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
The Busuoker boy's DWA was taken to a safe place after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old young man went to the camp shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m. when they didn't return home.
A search team was sent, including a local police and rescue unit, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vail waterfall.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and lost her head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were raised on the swan Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountain Hospital by an ambulance in stable condition.
Two unions met
The Minsk summit negotiations did not solve the problems for which they had been convened, but created a new format: the first European Union met with the first persons of the future of Eurasia.
For the first time, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of "hot problems."
Whether such a structure was capable of working effectively, was unclear; however, it was clear who had removed the tides from that summit.
Questions in this regard were dropped on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians followed by other Eurasians and Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko on television.
The Belarusian leader has set an example of obsession, which was the behaviour of a man who just blew the jackpot and planned a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maydan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU Ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to address the final briefing on their behalf - not just the Legitimation of the President with a 20-year experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Meljantsov, is certain that Brussels will not be able to speak to Minsk as much as it used to be.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met Aunt-a-tat with Lucashenko suggests that the relationship with the EU will continue to be frozen," he said, "The Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparation for the breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began well before the November Maydan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on the simplification of visa and readmission, modernization dialogues - listed the fireman - and negotiations on international security have been held with the US.
The States have even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them were only chewing the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, was able to maintain its relationship with Ukraine - quite warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Porošenko could come to Belarus to negotiate.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militia in Donbass, with all the strictness, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, and the Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful the Lukashenko movement to political diversification will be in terms of how often Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings in the near future.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected from the relationship in the new format.
The press secretary, Ashton Maya Kochiančić, simply stated "The Fire" that, in the face of war and peace issues, the topic was not a priority.
At the same time, it was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next place to meet on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The declaration of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by the European Union, was the result of the degta for Minsk.
However, at the closing briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties did not mind that Minsk should remain the central venue for meetings both in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" is gaining the status of a fully hand-held European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included Euromissaries on trade and energy, had led to the conclusion that the main thrust of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the schedule of future negotiations on the supply of gas at the meeting and on overcoming the concerns of the TC countries under the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU is more ambitious than the peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner, Karl De Gucht, however, pointed out that the EU representatives "come to Minsk to find a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences rather than vice versa."
It appears, however, that the crisis in Ukraine will work in Belarus in the economy.
Its consequences - and above all the West and Russia's mutual sanctions - give Minsk, which has so far experienced sanctions, a long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the Head of the Mises Research Centre, the ex-Candidate of the President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the ability of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumventing sanctions.
In doing so, there are supply schemes followed by Vladimir Putin at the Minsk summit.
"Initiators of these schemes, " stressed Romanchuk "The Fire," not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long developed supply schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
The Russian business urgently needs to re-establish them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not lose control of production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials, also focusing on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very useful."
In Romanchuk ' s view, the role of the host of the EU ' s and TC negotiating platform is ideal for Lucashenko and in terms of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, and the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million in compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on the euromers.
This could raise Lucashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hostship without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format, is decorated, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague, stressed that the new format had been initiated by Kiev.
"It was your offer to gather, without any ink, to discuss, not from the booze bark to make a decision, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," he referred before the cameras to Petra Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, she was rumoured to have initially opposed the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, the Belarusian diplomatic office has been careful to emphasize that Belarus, in organizing EU and TC interactions on its land, does not pursue selfish goals, and the ultimate objective of this format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the area of security, put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," said "The Fire" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, a department where words have recently been carefully picked up.
In Moscow there may be zones of paid entry.
The Government of Moscow considers the introduction of paid entry zones as a method of controlling the congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, transfers M24.ru with reference to Maxim Liksutov ' s transport locker.
One option that has successfully proved itself is paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we're gonna study it, see all the minuss and the benefits.
To talk about some decisions made on this matter before it's too early," Lixut told me.
Zammira stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow, is of great importance to the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of a central ring road already under way, and Lixuts added.
The recent construction of a central ring road is an example of not having to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient bypass infrastructure, there was no need for transit traffic in Moscow."
Also, Maxim Lixutov stated that the introduction of platoon parking had significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to dwell on what has been achieved.
Remember, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobian, participated in the construction ceremony for the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Conventional Road (SCAD).
Boring is sinful.
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, "City of sins 2: A woman who should be killed," did not exactly the revolution that could be expected of him.
The first "city of sins" (2005), which was removed with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, was a revolution between cinema, comics and literary nuar.
Sikwell is also revolutionic: in the sense that it destroys the basic "testis antithesis-mixing" chain of modern thinking (if understood by the word of the universe, and by antithesis, comics space).
From now on, it should read "thesis is antithesis - chaos."
The "city of sin 2" is chaotic at both dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yeah, a part of the heroes are familiar with the first city, although, uh, Marv's thunderstorm (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, just takes away -- as this native friend -- from the air of the knives and other obsessive axes.
But the old men are literally pushing up their elbows like they broke into town from some other movie, about the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry.
Okay, well, the story that the authors had shamelessly broken down at the most interesting place is at Johnny's super-funky player (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Yours is at the hunter-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something wretched to her by Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight, let's say, is not different from Johnny's face, especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are taken to characters with unstoppable regularity, is not a problem or even a half-bed.
These aren't people, we realize they're the archetypes of a nuar: a rock bitch that's too confident in himself as a player who's been able to get into a "low trap" sex detective corrupted by a pencil.
Well, when the archetype waltzs with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's not a movie anymore, but it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this soup world, there's something permanent.
The fighting whores from the first city continue to defend themselves from the forces of darkness that drain their home slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, and he's gonna look at the race, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the "city of sins 2" is another one.
Frank Miller was good about how the painter put the comics and the nuar together and, like the director, turned the idea of how to put the comics on the screen.
Comix and nuar are two aggressively opposite "realities."
==History==The novel was born in the late 1920s, while Dashil Hammet's novels "The Blood Jatwa" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created a nuar canon, called the hard-boiled school, "the wing of the school."
Or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from a sailor of Popai, a spinach, giving him wealth, Superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy's searcher to Halk, Torah, Pauca Man and other "hosts."
But in any movie based on comics, there was something harmful: the painted characters persisted in not wanting to grow a screen flesh, and they remained pretending to be in an "real" world around them.
In short, they were completely deprived of "existence."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, the traditional novel - with feelings, characteristics, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What are the Forces, what are the Tibo and Rugon Makkara, what even the Bolkon and Rostov thinks after Verde, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
This novel was peacefully muted into soap opera format, and, by definition, a marginal novel grew up to the level of a philosophical prose.
Hammet found out on his skin what it's like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
As by the way, they were at least close to the compartment and the genre tables like the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, director Jules Dassen, Joseph Loisy, Edward Dmitrick.
So the nuar, whose archetype they put, first, is rude and cynical, and secondly, is purely socialist.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "city of sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic to the nuar.
For the first time on the screen, comics lived without being shy of their graphic nature, not pretending to be a real film.
The darkness of a corrupt world where the Cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered the terrible son of a sedist, was worthy of per Hammet.
And the paintings, like the cut-off heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Elloy, the author of the Black Orchid and the best, that is, the declarative nausea, the neonuar representative.
The City of Sin 2 is not even a retreat, but a surrender of the radical style of Miller-Rodrigues before the tradition of comics.
Must have been a lot of this because of 3D technologies.
When you watch the second "city of sins," you feel like a prisoner in a glass ball, inside which the snow falls asleep with a toy clack.
But most often it's not snow, it's blood marks, but what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about socialism.
'Cause it's only possible when somewhere we have, sometimes on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can get back a girl walking around the curve or, say, tell a hopeless parent that her lipper is punished.
But when there is no place of sin in the city except sin, sin is no more than sin.
Boring like any rule.
Chaos "City of Sin 2" is just boring.
Justice for domestic rent gave this freshwater sin a little but a pencil.
Titres warn us that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In the most vegetarian episode of which a man's fingers are smashed, it gives him hell's humor.
Hammet would love it.
French socialists have to shut up and bring France into order, says Frasoua Olland's key ally.
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to "demonstrate the heat" towards the attacked socialist President, whose revolutions had not been approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured him that his Government would not question the disputed 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposals that fuelled the conflict, it should weaken the rules adopted by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his fellow Socialist Party to remain "one" with the Government.
However, Christian Tobra, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels by coming to the assembly of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to lose faith in the future.
Marin Le Pe, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not know that the new Vale Government would last longer than a few months.
François Olland is the naked king, but the naked and prince Manuel Wall, who is forced to gather a new government when the former summer has not lasted.
"And the new one won't last the autumn or winter," told the reporters Mrs. Le Pen.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to run.
The French ruling party experienced a blown-up in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believed that the Socialist Party was at risk of falling into several rival factions until the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist from the University of Xiance Po, warned that French people would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel that something changes quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without drugs" has been left without a lawsuit.
The Sverdlov Arbitration Court left without consideration the Regional Ministry of Governance ' s claim to the Cities Without Drugs Foundation.
The Authority intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent charges for the building at the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear before the courts twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of the Sverdlovsk Region left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Region (MIGISO) to the Cities Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders, the Mayor of Evgeny Royzman, Eugeneburg).
Regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent charges for the building.
Today, it has become known that the plaintiff has not appeared before the court twice, which has led to a decision to refuse the hearing.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MMIGASO Directorate was not clear, the head of the legal department Maxim Tits did not answer the phone calls.
It was also not possible to contact representatives of the Fund.
Remember, this is a mansion that has held a fund at the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by the ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed an action with the Sverdlov Arbitration Court to remove the fund from the building.
According to the claim, the agency required the court to recognize the unincorporated contract for the use of a phamber mansion.
According to the MICIVICO Directorate, the agreement did not establish substantial conditions for the rental of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlov Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, and an appeal was filed with the 17th Permi Arbitration Court, which was granted.
The Fund then filed a cassation appeal against the decision, which was rejected, before which the decision was appealed by the Foundation to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court took the motion to the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, under which the fund again started paying rents, as described by the head of the city of Eugene Royzman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration of the region has given us this building free of charge, recognizing our achievements in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration decided otherwise," he stated.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Ekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Ekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, Ekaterinburg's deputy, soleross Alexander Kosintsov, proposed to the mayor of the city, Speaker of the pride of Eugenia Roysman, to resign.
A criminal case was brought against a person arrested on suspicion of murdering a retired member of the proud Oleg Keenev, who was considered a fellow mayor.
How Eugenia Roysman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it became known that a criminal case had been initiated on the blog of Mayor Eugenia Roysman of Eugenia Roysman (art. 128.1).
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, where the Director of the Legal Center for Protection, Anna Filatova, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of his blog records of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-wife.
Mayor Catherineburg is convinced that "it's another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone's gonna turn into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is to present his new developments, the press is experiencing further leakages of what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to American media sources, the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of the combined Apple and Visa payment systems project, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, on 9 September, Apple could, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make the new iPhone 6 smartphone available to the mobile wallet function.
The company itself rejects any comment on this matter.
This function allows for payment on the store ' s cash register using a smartphone.
The identification of payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
IPhone is reported to be the first time that NFC technology (near field communication) will be built into the iPhone, which allows for the non-contamination of payment by smartphone and the corresponding reading device on the cash register.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconuctors).
For the first time, the NFC function was introduced as early as 2004 through the cooperation of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconuctors and more than 100 other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC function, Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
Google presented Google Wallet in May 2011, allowing users to tie bank cards to their Google account and pay through a smartphone to Android.
However, American experts stress that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in promoting the NFC technology, US realists still tend to be cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their shops in such systems.
Therefore, the observers now hope that Apple's entry into this market will make it possible for the rhythmiers to accelerate and intensify the introduction of this technology at their trading points.
Foreign Ministry of France: Paris ' s position on Russia ' s supply of " Mistraleys " has not changed
The official representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Romen Nadal, stated that Paris had maintained its position regarding the supply by Russia of Mistral-type helicopter carriers.
"I may recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Olland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today, the level of sanctions is not an obstacle to delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," quoted by Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Policy Office replied to the question whether the deteriorating situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris ' s position to implement the contract.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, reported by people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a market value company of $6.8 billion, access to cruise ships of the Lux class and secured clients Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, and the sources on Sunday were informed, warning that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources requested that they remain unnamed because negotiations are not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, runs 13 cruise ships along routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which share eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced a $1.2 billion income in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
It is expected that the 29-million-dollar cruise industry will benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies, such as China and India, in subsequent years.
The companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in the US regulatory bodies for primary public stocking in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after $850 million in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists, in 2000, as a result of a merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casino controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting held a share of 28 per cent, Apollo held a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 per cent in the company, according to the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public posting of Prestige Cruises shares.
Cream television company can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
In the Ministry of Communications of Russia, it is proposed that 250 million roubles be allocated to the State television radio company Crimea in 2014.
According to the Mincomcommunication Draft Regulation, which is located on a single portal for the disclosure of legislation, subsidies are intended to "cost the creation of conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea."
The money will also be used to purchase equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems in the radio company building, founded in 1959, reports "RIA News."
Hong Kong democratic activists disrupt the Chinese representative ' s statement the day after the election decision.
The group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, swinging the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of the majority of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision made it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and forced democratic activists once again to promise to stop Hong Kong ' s financial centre with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, because Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the Beijing publication of the document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and staged a sit-down.
The briefing by Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People ' s Congress, Jeang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the Feng Wei State Council, were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
The activists stated that they would meet at the Hong Kong Head of Government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land owned by Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to join 400 hectares of land on the western bank of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
As Bi-bi-si says, the decision to join South Wifley's land is linked to the desire to pay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Minister of Defence announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Sayiba Arikat, the world public must hold Israel accountable for "the continuing settlement activity on the western bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem."
Putin demands that Kiev begin negotiations on "State" of eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government cease fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "State" of the divided region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the East Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin ' s call to the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to the obvious strategy that he has followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists to take over the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novoroscia de facto independence in order to get close to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the State First Channel of Television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which had been seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces attacked peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, the "lluminium player" reported to ITAR-TASS.
"We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin ' s words about statehood had been seen in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed within months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Press Secretary of the Kremlin in order to correct Putin's "inverted interpretation" of the words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to behave against the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russian, and pre-conflict interviews showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policies themselves, in fact by handing over to the Kremlin actual control over territory that would connect Russia ' s main territory with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was connected five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
The regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea also contain mines, factories and lithium factories that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh constitutional amendments to allow the regions to exercise greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist rebels accused of arming and inciting Moscow.
Putin ' s last call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders, as equals, followed a new rebel offensive last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of the city of Novoazovsk into an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say is afraid that it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory before Crimea itself.
This has led to extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupola, a steel port with 5,000 inhabitants between Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Porošenko asked the European Union Leaders ' Assembly in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which had been independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-return," warned Porosenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two Russian armoured equipment columns and 1,000 military personnel last week entered the Donetsk region in order to support separatists in distress, Colonel Andry Liesenko, the press secretary of the Council for National Security and Defence of Ukraine reported to reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Listenko on Sunday.
The naked scan captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at hackers who might have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged by a series of frank photos depicting naked Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star of "Gold Games" Lawrence and Superstars, including the models of Kate Upton and Kara Delevin, the singers of Rianna, Arian Grande and Lea Michel and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski and living in Melbourne Greco also allegedly stole photos from iCloud.
There are 101 names of celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said Confidential: "This is disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's awful that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "sweet" and that the people she was targeted "we feel they've been invaded."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photographs of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two cadets, where she lies in a pool with a naked chest.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of "Chuck" Strakhowski and the actress from the "Closed Reception" Browning didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
The representative of Lawrence said TMZ: "This is an incredible invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker by writing on Twitter: "The photographs stolen from the mobile phone are actually nothing different from the sale of stolen goods."
It's just from a legal point of view that you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities
The mass hacking of the stars' accounts may have been made through vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario of events described The Next Web resource.
The Github resource published a script in Python, which allowed us to pick up passwords for the Find My Phone company Apple.
This service allows us to track the location of iPhone.
It has the same logic and password as Apple ID for access to Apple iCloud, from which photographs of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed us to cross-check the Find My Phone password.
This method has consistently introduced all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The writer of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service, the number of password input options was unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized after several unsuccessful attempts to introduce the wrong password, the account must be blocked and reported to the user of an attempted hack.
Because of vulnerability, the users did not receive any reports of an attempt to pick up the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp's Twitter user, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, Saturday, and a script program was written to collect passwords.
At present, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
Resources contacted Hackapp user and noted that the above vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister reappeared foreign records
Although there is no firm evidence that vulnerability in Find My Phone has been used to steal photographs, there has already been a wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case of Apple, the media stated that the safety of the clouds was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
The Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev, had also been hacked into Russia earlier.
If the wrongdoers had access to the iCloud described above, the password to the head of government account in the microbloging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web has not been able to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian 5th fence.
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anne Buryak.
A decree has been published on the legal information portal.
At the beginning of this year, an athlete moved to Russia to a permanent place of residence and asked the Federation of Modern Five to be given the opportunity to advocate for a Russian team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in personal firstness and became the World Championship in a mixed estafet, which is one of the new types of sports programme.
She's keeping her leadership in the current season.
According to the rules, she would need special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to address the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian sportsman to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the chess player, Catherine Lagno, a levovian, who is a double champion of Europe (2005, 2008), a blitz peace (2010) and a fast chess game (2014).
As part of Ukraine's women's team, an athlete was the winner of the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the team championship of the world in Astana (2013) and Europe's team championship in Warsaw (2013).
SKR stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The investigation committee of the Russian Federation (CSR) discontinued the criminal case of the accident of the Tu-204 aircraft by Red Wings.
This is reported by the agency's press service.
The decision was made in connection with the death of an aircraft commander and an aircraft carrier.
The forensic evidence showed that the disaster was caused by an increased landing rate, a failure by the crew to comply with standard landing procedures, and an unintended withdrawal of engines for high-speed direct traction.

Alexander Emelianenko began training at SIZO
The famous Russian mixed-style fighter Alexander Emelianenko, 33-year-old, who is in SIZO for sexual assault against a domestic worker, has completely recovered from injuries and began training.
That's what Championate reports.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted, on 9 May he was detained in Tambowa following his accident, which resulted in a fracture of the thigh.
Emeliano Jr. was arrested until 31 August and sentenced on 1 September.
However, the court had been postponed and the investigation had insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
In the event that an athlete's guilt is proven, he is facing imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
Emelianenko spent his last fight in January this year, losing his technical knockout with a compatriot Dmitri Svanski.
Alexander is the younger brother of Fedor Emelianenko's more famous fighter.
The latter is a four-fold champion of the world in mixed martial arts, a four-time champion of the world and a seven-time Russian champion of the armed Sambo.
The genius proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of man.
The expression of the person is biologically universal for mankind, and every body involved in its creation and group of muscles are not accidental but an additional means of expressing power and threat, and scientists from Australia and the United States have been identified.
They spoke about their discoveries in Evolution and Human Behavior, and they are briefly described in a press release by the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The monstrous expression of the face - moved and lowered down the eyebrows, drawn to the thin line of the lips, blown nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even blind from birth children who never saw it, notes the lead author of Aaron Sell's study.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had emerged for the effective handling of disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his or her circumstances, and he brings it to the interviewer with anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of their other hypothesis: physically powerful people are more angry and hand-held, consider themselves entitled to impose other inappropriate conditions on them, and prefer robust methods of resolving conflicts peacefully.
In response to the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of commerce," scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles creating the angry expression of a person should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of an interviewer - and thus make it possible to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer individuals where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the eyebrows that have been lowered or put forward separately have not made the face angry, the stronger physical participants in the study have been unanimously recognized as having shown such characteristics.
Man's anger, like animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated expression of self-power that compels us to accept and obey.
A man blows up his nostrils and squeezes his lips for the same purpose as a frog that blows, or a grandmother who shows his fanks.
"The anger is "launched" by a refusal of the interviewer to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that demonstrates the opposite side as effectively as possible the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry person is arbitrary, all of them express the same thing." John Tubi observed anthropologist.
The Ministry of Communications has offered 250 million rubles from the Radio Company Crimea.
The Ministry of Communications proposed that 250 million rubles of the autonomous non-profit organization "Cream" be allocated from the federal budget in 2014.
This is mentioned in the draft Government Regulation prepared by the Lenta.ru department.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment."
In particular, it is intended to convert the hardware, studio, video, central hardware and video servers for the money allocated.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, from the funds allocated, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic line (OLS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The State Broadcasting Company of Crimea was established in 1959, broadcasting in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the territory of the peninsula has been covered by the television broadcaster.
In 2011, Cream Teleradio received a digital broadcasting licence.
