I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

Outside the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
Tom had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?

We slept in the open.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Wasn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?

The waitress had a white scout on the table.
That day, I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.

Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.

None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine do you buy?
I'm not gonna hack.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.

She gives him everything he asks for.
Is that for sale?

We can't afford to buy a new car.
It only makes the problem worse.

How many pens!
Mary, are you in the right shape right now?
I corrected the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom did 20 push-offs.
I'm sure you can handle your work.

You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.

Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.

I thought you were Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.

There's always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You fooled us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.

You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom should have done.
Tell her hello from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer was a shock to everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?

Do you have any pain anywhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door, or we'll hack it!

Got a message?
Tom called me suddenly yesterday.
We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.

This car looks angry.
Are you studying English?
Are you my enemy?

Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have an errand for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "No one knows."
What do you like about it?
When I arrived at the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.

I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's sitting until late night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't laugh at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God set aside the reconciliation of the king's authority and the clergy in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to our house.
Hiding is thin, but strong, and it won't puke.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six to five for television viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.

He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I wasn't cute.
Do you cry often?

That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk's old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness isn't visible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same height.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary's younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I think I made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Tom will be teaching French next year.
I listened to her for the rest.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why are you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
Don't you speak French?
How dare you do that!
This knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
You're only gonna have a minute.
I would like to change that situation very much.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never survived it.
You want to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
"Shut your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censorship spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no escape for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you fake it, join me.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I'd really like to go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like this before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's hurry, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom isn't leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they get you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
This decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
Tom didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered after illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
The food of meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy his life.
I want you to shut up for me.
No one loves me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yeah, did you tell him?" "No, he found out" himself.
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought of something.
Sugar is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for a signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a flaking lion.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut my razor.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.

I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.

I'm used to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom is in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom is in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I've ever eaten.
I had parking problems.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
Do you know what that is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom has never been late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
Do you still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on every leaf.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did you start?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
I don't think it's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it to me."
When are you gonna clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do that.
Does it make sense to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said that he tried to do that three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom is small, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find Tom, please.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is unclear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you know what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This drawer weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's an asshole.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he never met her.
I thought he was gonna kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
It's not gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's a lot of paperwork.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.

Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.

Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed completely calm.

Tom wants to go on his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.

It's awfully bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Tom was first last time.
Everybody's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom will fix that.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

There's a bench underneath the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you gonna stop me?
What do you think of my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?

It's gonna bring bad luck to your family.

I have to win.
It's no use asking him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to sleep.

Tom has a snake on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's that dog's name?
Walk on the sidewalk.

When did you ask her?

We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom will be late for the plane.
She's always getting up early.
You want her to help you?
Are you eating rice every day?
We sat in the middle of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When do we have a woman president?
He's here hoping to see you.

I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.

I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.

Take them to the hospital.

She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.

What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.

She cried.
I told Tom Mary had to do that.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.

Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone yelled.
What's better?

I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.

Is Paris far?
How much time is it in Tokyo now?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim won't come today.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me the same good.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would do.

Has Mary cleaned her room yet?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.

You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom drank pancakes.
He made a few letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much is it?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since 2:30.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.

Does he know me?
I hate this place.
One day you'll thank me.
Tom watches TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still don't think so.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two hours of the night.
Mary wasn't thirsty.
Tom wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for the heavy rain.
Apparently she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love a bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up Saturday?
I put milk in coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house isn't far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no win-wins.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it would be impossible to do that.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You're not gonna catch Tom.
Did you kill her?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the animal.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defence.
What difference does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather permits, we'll get to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His gray eyes are blushing and sparkling, and his pale face has usually come to life and has been covered with Romanians.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands are blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play better than to learn.
He was accepted for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess which language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of battle.
In a few days, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom isn't used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, are you suddenly in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste that much time.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom is wearing a pirate costume.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get a tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that this man is who he's giving himself up for?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezub, led Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go to this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Gesse.
To be honest, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach trial, it is generally accepted that there are twelve members of the jury court.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian Embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four on the line.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something wasn't okay.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
Here comes another day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is known worldwide by his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamonds are a precious stone.
Get some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaryes.
Stand back, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want what's best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why are so many people suffering from under-assessment?
Was it too easy?
What Alice faced waiting for the answer was a sudden war, and it was a loud noise, so sharp that she could break her drums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he entered the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary put things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
It's gonna sound like it's gonna come back.
We got a canoe.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
Rich people sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed into the tree.
The language I teach is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom is doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president is ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can you solve this?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
It's in the 20th floor building.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
Didn't you happen to know when Tom was coming back?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little while?
Are you gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you work with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then he would now be a rich man.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind coming up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn like an ass.
I think you can be relied on.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom spoke in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but some girl picked up.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very hard on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom has little moustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't be mad at her.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and well.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom was awful to watch.
Tom's face is red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
The hunger for him was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
The room needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs were hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk about something important to both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size she's got.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Tom left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't stop thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
You can make butter, cheese, and a lot of other things out of milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Be nice.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I smoked before.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as they expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think to ask for Tom's help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in the human language?
No one's hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the snow lavina thinks it's his fault.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When does the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's time to spit.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she'd stay at her place to sleep.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I'm sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is it gonna hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.

Is everything ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom is doing in the garage.
I don't think it works like that.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.

Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.

That's not what happened here.
When's your dad coming home?
I understand.
Tom extended Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're clearly tired.
We're champions.
Tom is deaf.
Tom said it wasn't enough.

Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What chemical sign does methyl hydrogen acid refer to?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
Tom needs to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do that.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls, it's cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We ate fast and left immediately.
There's a big garden back home.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal from the soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The calithka was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.

She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples are big.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.

Let's go far, let's go in the car.
You're interrupting me.
She was wondering what his lips would taste like.
A good coach is training this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was detained because of the heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do that or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Because it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephants are made of elephant bones.
I'm not a child anymore.
"What's up, Mike?" "My name is Tom."

It's a dumb coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom lived in Boston with a child.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been silent all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went on.

Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India cows are sacred animals.
I've turned my imagination on.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstand you.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's a lot of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are age-olds.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
I'm gonna have to wait with that.

He's twice my age.
Tom knows that the mistake he made was a mistake.
Japan's soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced a traumatized player.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'll go to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom only pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom is watching.
We can open the windows again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom is lost.
I was gonna go out when the phone called.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was was was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing is as relaxing as a hot bath.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a little siren song for me.
What's it like being married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?

If I had time to do that, I'd do it.
Do you see Tom's boat?
A big picture?
This medicine will help you.
Stop making noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
You have to treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop!
Nothing like a beer pack after a long day of work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long do you need?
Let's take a break here.

They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your seat belts during the take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.

Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to my summer vacation.
Can I make it different?
He looks great from here.
Tree houses are easily flammable.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog is still alive.
I'm going to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need this anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do that without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not gonna have fun tonight, I need to get ready for class.

Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You're just pointing out the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault that it happened.
It's just like clockwork.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all out for the summer.
Let's move him.
Let's leave it until tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning lady interrupted the conversation.

I still don't know why Tom did that.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a legacy disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can get married to your dog.
The best defense is assault.
She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live in rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How are you?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars come out at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom is sinking his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bicycle.
I'm not talking to the body at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't get on time.
It's seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see dawn.
The dinosaurs were extinct a long time ago.

Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can put eggs away.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got it all coming out of my hand today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned how to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed so much in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut meat, so I used my pepper knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll be able to adjust to the village life soon.
Keep a bucket with water next to you.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
There's a river deeper than that.
Thank you from the heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
It is a big problem in Norwegian where words are written separately when they are to be slit.

I like to learn other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
What did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate caviar.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave Mary a gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They first got on the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning beats twice to one place.
I'm not braging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Take care of it.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we cut down and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I've known you all my life.
I want Tom never to write to my daughter again.
The rabbits are growing fast.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
What time would it cost to clean your coat?
We'll paint it.
The holes are narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.

Tell me frankly.
I'll come to anything.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the petition.
Did you try to talk to Tom about that?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Do you want them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
In the near future, we can meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a beaver.
I slept on my stomach.
Keep me posted.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps at forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom started to suspect something was wrong.
Beer's a beer.
I don't think Tom will like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said it was yours.
Tom is busy with his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
Tom watches a figure skating on TV.
We're gonna have to sleep outside today.
Did Tom show Mary how to do that?
Amazing, isn't it?
I've got a face.
School's only five minutes away.
Tom put his spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Do you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you a link.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
How many more people know about this?
I felt it.
