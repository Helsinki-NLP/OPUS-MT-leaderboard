The Republic ' s Resistance Strategy to Obama ' s Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies on the need to combat fraud in elections.
However, at the Brennan Center, the last myth is that it is argued that cases of fraud in elections in the United States are more rare than in cases of death from lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 electoral fraud cases in the United States in 10 years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partially discrediting the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that make registration or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained momentum since the November 2010 elections, bringing 675 new seats to Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were passed in 2011 alone, restricting voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the electorate to present an identity card with a photograph and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the voter on the day of the will and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state ordered voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities have also made it a matter of urgency to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo identification cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million who have reached the age required for voting, do not have identity cards with a photograph issued by their state government authority.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such a document in 2012.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card is often more than $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earn less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo identity card.
But that's not all.
Students who are believed to vote for candidates from Democrats are not allowed to use a photo identity card issued by their educational institution in several states.
The same states, however, allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for Republicans to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at restricting the vote of Latin American nationals.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated legislation in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a decline of 17 per cent in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the pre-election voters were African-American, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin American nationals.
Only 11 per cent of voters represented 24 per cent of those who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who formed 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of those who voted in advance were voters.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been implemented by the Democratic Governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney-General.
This allowed for a partial limitation of negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photograph identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules that had come into effect would certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Criticism against Democrats condemns the bias of the laws that have been enacted, with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have enacted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral panel to win presidential elections.
It is too early to state with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is clear: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partially discrediting the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: to pass a test or not?
In fact, the FSA test sometimes produces erroneous results, false negative and sometimes false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to undergo a dissertation, have more to doubt.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies carried out in the United States showed numerous cases of infection among the groups under investigation, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate for patients who had passed the screening and those who had not passed it.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis was 30 to 40 per cent higher for those who had not passed the screening.
So I'd recommend a test starting at 50 years, or 40 years, if one of the direct relatives had a prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also at high risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
Cancer can be both aggressive and virulent.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, but by making choices, in these cases, in favour of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men identified as cancer will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease moves forward, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we define precisely the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I'd recommend a test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not it is necessary to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess all the reasons for and against the PSA test.

Prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle receptac to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30 per cent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one smoked no more, that figure would have increased to at least 50 per cent," says André Bolje, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer are due to ethnicity.
Several types of cancer remain unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is related to 85 per cent of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It's causing enormous damage to human health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says press secretary André Bolje.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after smoking has ceased, the risk of cancer dying is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct guinea, food herb, pancreas and uterus.
"Expectations show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against fattest cancer" is added to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of fat intestinal cancer.
It should also be avoided for sausage products.
Coating meat by copying, drying or filling may result in carcinogens.
"The latter may harm body cells and lead to cancer," explained at the Association.
Vitamines
In recent years, many scientists have researched the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But the results of these studies are not clear at this time.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other resulted in the opposite result.
There is also a lack of clarity in assessing the impact on vitamin D cancer development.
He stressed, however, that it was important to discuss his concerns and family anamnesus with a doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs Bozon in detail
Last summer's report that scientists might have discovered the Higgs boson caused real agitation - and not without cause.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle that has been predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behaviour of the matter - but which has not been discovered in the past.
But physics isn't entirely certain it's about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented this week at one major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's just imagine what this is about the Higgs boson, because the chances of making mistakes seem minimal, and see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law that is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way this rule can go around, don't even try too hard, or hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it also appears that there is one law of this nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paulie, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" is "state" in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physics divides particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called farmers, who wisely obey Paulie's principle.
In the other, the bosons, the heinous gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least that principle, which means that they may find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (incidentally, quite unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons we're not talking about here, and the "parts of force" through which the main forces of nature are spread and to which, in some ways, the Higgs boson is involved.
These are the most bosons to be stressed, not all the exotic creatures that could be thought of.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronic, it's due to one incredibly banal boson, a photon, or a part of the light, which is a "curator" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, it "breaks" an electromagnetic field in this particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into the pond.
It produces an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore one of the "power carrier" bosons.
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with only the difference that the other field, the Higgs field, must be "infractioned" in order to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to trigger it, very and very high energy needs to be achieved, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only shake a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one in CERN, the Big Adronic Collider, which is a 27 km diameter ring, to achieve such huge energy.
Analogue with an electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a paper sheet, for example, will never hold itself on the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have a mass, while others (like photons) do not.
So, what can "may bring" all these studies, ask Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SMS), and this also allows physics to find a discrepancy between observations and projections of the MM.
In addition, some of them are passionately eager to find such a discrepancy, i.e. the slightest inconsistency can open the door to "new physics" and shut down some of the Model's holes.
The latter, to be said, still has significant shortcomings without offering any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter that shapes about 80 per cent of the universe (oh!).
But we haven't found such a difference in CERN yet.
Consequences
The use of these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that she is not.
See: In the early 1960s, laser research pioneers at Bell's labs could not even assume what a revolution would call for their work.
They've seen their applications in science, but no more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself designed the first continuous laser (presiding to be impulsive) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
In addition, an annex can be found for a tool accompanying the study.
For example, the same Willyard Boyle developed a small light sensor during its optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although it was not his original purpose, now serves as a "gloss" for all the world's digital cameras and earned the 2009 Nobel Physics Prize.
It certainly doesn't mean that the work of the Big Adronic Collider is bound to change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and a bill was being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Dolg tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living in his apartment in Monterey.
The cancer of prostates that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbua's palliative care shelter in Beloy, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
Disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents people from going to the bathroom and even eating alone.
When he sits at the table where he has an appetite for lunch, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He's awake, even smiling, talking to strangers working around him, bringing him medicine, taking him to the bathtub.
Manhood before normal death.
"My greatest wish for me to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our life, we are taught that a man has to piss standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua's shelter.
Regressing to the condition of the child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on the ability of a man" to deal with the decline, " he claims.
Since many people who are involved in palliative care believe that important events occur at the very height of this decline.
Patients who go to Viktor-Gadbua's palliative shelter are all sick with cancer.
The projections give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called "the cure."
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die "in consciousness of suffocation."
But the disease let me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put a mask that makes her breathing easier.
She remains waiting for her son to come from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor Gadbua's shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutritional support.
This is a palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
That's very little, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
This life goes on under the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the orphanage.
Be comfortable with physical, emotional or emotional.
The dying one, we'll agree to give company strips from brandy or pepsi, looking at what he's asking.
We don't have to control sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought Mr. H.'s beer, who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank that beer in his legs at the dead.
"We help the loved ones as well as the patients," says Natalie Sawar, the director of nursing care.
There's no day like the previous one at Victor Gadbua's orphanage.
Next to the 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, having been laid on his pillows in his honor, a young man of 36 years of age, surrounded by parents, wife and two little children, and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months of three to five beds, always working for cancer patients under 45 years of age," Dr. Christian Martel said.
53% of the patients admitted to the Viktor-Gadbua shelter come from home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, at the hospital or at the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Viktor-Gadbua Shelter and the Great Monreyal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Québec's health care system that makes many practitioners of palliative care fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and helps suicide.
Starting in October, a manifesto signed by the labs in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mountain and Dr. Bernard Liapant, has been circling their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an emergency room in scary pains, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have been trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Elena Richard's hope of survival was minimal when she stopped the chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, she said.
She told me herself that my days were counted!
There isn't a lot of care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who request death will be supported by a medical officer for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team makes their pain easier.
However, it must be noted that palliative care is not absolutely powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the director of palliative care at the Grand Monreyal House, patients are not susceptible to dehydration in 8 per cent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedition where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or continuously.
You can't pretend we don't know about these sufferings anymore.
Increasingly, patients who fail to ease pain can have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to have an euthanasia," which means "I want to make me feel better."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Canadian Health Research Institute.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party funders and Italian mafia specialists day after day tell what they know about a huge "system" conducive to the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
The Industria, which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how this system breaks up after all the funds have been put into action, Jacques Dusheno, deputy and former chief of the Monreyal police" is kidding.
He was the result of a scandal in 2011 as a side result of an investigation into the official traffic contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of that time from the Liberals, Jean Chare, agreed very reluctantly.
Dusheno's report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses that the Ministry of Transport alone would have retained a billion dollars on contracts" if some had kept their instincts from taking a share.
The Charbonno Commission "has already replaced the two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "open the schemes behind individuals."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the Special Unit Molot, who, after 2009, had forced the Montreal to stop the overstatement of contract costs.
A series of searches have been carried out over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotta, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gil Wyankur, who had recently resigned from the post of Mayor of Lavalla, the third largest city in Quebec province.
He is suspected of having received bribes on numerous occasions when placing public orders.
In addition, several engineers of the Monreyal route and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcuro and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, following an investigation into the system of receiving government contracts.
For several years, Zambia has contributed 3 per cent of the value of contracts entered into in Montreal to some mafia broker who in turn transferred the money of the party of Mayor Gerald Tramble, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambia had stolen money to the right and to the left; it had listed more than $88,000 (about 68,000 euros) to various provincial parties, mostly liberals then in power.
He also admitted that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Review contracts in which value has been overvalued
In Montreal, the system of corruption worked in vain.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described her in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the cost of which he had earned.
Other road construction officials admitted that they had received 30 to 40 per cent of the bill by false supplements.
Then one organizer from the mayor ' s party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Trumple of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party ' s funds with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trumple resigned early in November, putting Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to forget the alarm.
The mayor of Rivier de Prari County in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million builders in the middle of the building boom.
70 per cent of the dirty money in the campaign
She said that in the investigation that would eventually be initiated, she would "take a little bit to understand the functioning of an ants system in order to stop the gangren and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as a "bolic but positive" process.
We're in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we get out of the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno notes for his part that "the healers stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the elected officials who knew about the scheme" but who did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec is 70%, he's kidding, "I said it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to $100 donations to parties, but he says that this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the electoral costs, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete restructuring of the system of government contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down below; we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story casts shadows on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"POW isn't FC Barcelona!"
During this season, you've reached an extraordinary scale in the FSW.
How do you explain that growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be the new dimension of the POW.
Great players have arrived.
I'll break up next to them every day.
Technical staff have also brought much.
These factors make me raise my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's happening very quickly in football.
But I'm not breaking up.
From the very beginning at the pre-training centre in Klerfontaine and before I arrived in St. Etienne, I've always moved forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition that Carlo Anchelotty has established...
Filling this summer isn't new to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is very important.
It leads to a player like me wanting to be at the level and to be as high as possible.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's been helped by deputies like Claude McElele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancholotti is the master of position?
Sure.
Ancholotty has the respect of all technical staff.
Today, in the First League, he is not equal, and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with the great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I went away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the POW season?
In the First League, Lyon took our leader's seat.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have been effectively classified in one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Everything can be from now on.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
First, we want to end up first in our group, before Porto, to be able to accept a return match in one eighth of the finals.
Can the SCW become a first-class European club in the short term?
He's already got a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure long-term positions.
That's not true today.
The POJ has the financial means to make this project real.
Don't take title in the First League, like last season, is it gonna be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship title.
Last season, we were close to this.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points involve the title of the champion.
But another team, Monpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Even though strong teams like Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting too much for the POJA?
It's okay to expect a lot of things from us, given how much we've got and how many players we've got.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're home winning 4-0 against Tru and we're still found to be criticized for, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what the first thing people expect from us is.
We'll never win every weekend with a 4-0 account.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't been able to go to one eighth of the finals in two seasons, even though they have spent huge money too!
In view of the amounts invested, we've presented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
It would be disrespectful to our opponents and to the French championship.
Lion and Marcel, who weren't at the height of last season, were "provoked" by this new POJA.
It shows how fascinating the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
The POJA seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's performance.
Well, what if they say there's some "Zlatanodependency"?
That only means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he's losing a lot of his head.
He came for that, and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and star of world scale.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he did is really exceptional.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with France's team?
How disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from spending some time playing games.
I've seen a lot of things out there, and I've come out stronger.
Today, I'm able to play a good selection match.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized at the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham in charge of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He has good positions in the selection group for the world championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and inspires the victory.
What Laurent Blanc was.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, and he has qualified us in Euro.
I hope that Didier Desham will lead the Blues to Brazil.
A good, well-deserved one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-on-one-one-one-one-one-year-old in Spain on October 16th is a fundamental match?
This game gave us faith in itself.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there was no match in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current exchange of money, based on centobanks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with commissions for processing them.
Moreover, as often happens to these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, has led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (psevdonim), is at the same time a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros ...) and a protected BitTorrent exchange protocol, which allows for the exchange of files between participants at the same level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept bunktons for donations or payments.
The Bitcomin course, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning today to about $10 (the courses are shown on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special about the world's exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its virtual currency report published in October was interested in the system.
He describes the Bitcon as "the most successful virtual currency" that competes with the dollar or the euro and "like ordinary currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency as "credits" used to promote video games that are generated in the game process or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central authority.
In Bitcomin, all network nodes are both holders of the books, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each deal between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment may the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The collection of information relevant to this transaction is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the battlecases used in the deal actually exist in a public account book distributed all over the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
It's a file hesh phase, i.e. a big file conversion to digital signature, short and unique.
The "bout" computers are new transactions and add a number to her before "hash" is all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other knots can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be unremittingly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user was very quick (less than 10 minutes) to pay twice the same amount of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that's done the job gets 50 bitkens.
In order to avoid inflation, the award is regularly distributed in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bunches in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one centillion, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with the increase in computing capacity.
The life of the network has already survived the rises and falls.
Bitcoin ' s services were attacked, and the Bitcoin were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used does not apply to the record itself," assures Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has that deficiency.
Large players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as WordPress's blog platform, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adie Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analysed the account book and found that almost 80 per cent of the Bitcomans were out of circulation.
"Gigant sales" was announced in November.
Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged, and John Holmkvist, working in Coinabul, who converts the Bitcons into gold, is happy.
Pierre Nuaz, another author of this currency benefit, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contractive payment via a mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner has better control of his personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It's only enough to give an address that can be photographed and recognized by a phone that explains Pierre Nuaz, making sure he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards a more horizontal revision of hierarchical systems.
"For a while before Bitcoin is approved, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, intends, by the way, to review the various risks that are considered to be high today if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Subori).
NATO and Americans should follow them in late 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not only on us.
We have suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we have seen as terrorists.
And we are, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former commanders in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are suffering, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer be helped as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French forces from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills of planted almond trees thanks to French loans, took place in good order.
The convoy of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban attacks on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from the period of their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their taking over the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the monstrousness of these peasants, in which Al-Qaida overcame them, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahidees, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to retain women in subordinate positions.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become merchants of State land to sell them to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that isn't a thief.
Many young people want to leave as those who have managed to be generous in the United States - capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in today ' s world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they valued its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population was under the age of 25; there were now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
The jobs of these young people, who do not want to return to the darkening of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders, must be ensured.
All, including armed fighters, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and look everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities who would command her would be considered legitimate?
Old anti-Soviet commanders are already taking steps to re-establish provincial friends who are not subordinate to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, according to Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a central State with strong presidential authority, removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, beginning in the 1950s, and even earlier, depended on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is operational, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority has been given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the thirty years of war, State control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only increased the sense that Western countries were only present there to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transportation to export them through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations on a day of equal footing.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: the girl child, boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds and to fulfil the impossible task of reconciling aid with offensive operations, the "military civil service" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These work, with the intensive involvement of local labour, helped to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What are we gonna do to remember ourselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what farmers want, as they have told me, we need to provide them with little non-military support that would be well controlled and direct to them.
Heavy births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohamed Murcy.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it had decided to play a va-bank.
He announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
A week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete its work.
For two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "automatic brute" by continuing to "break the word" and "break the right."
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which compels the Brathites to abandon their intention to explain the Egyptian text, an article by article.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring public and democratic legitimacy, while frustration is rampant throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Even more so, the call for an accelerated ballot goes to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave extraordinary powers," which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they clapping the door without being able to convey their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the required quorum to be achieved, 11 persons, alternate participants, were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, have forgotten the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the Constituent Assembly's watch was wrong.
The text on which a vote was still taking place yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The goal of universal attention, article 2, ultimately remained identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the sharia principles are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules," which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is testimony to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Licemerie," the liberals answer, who only see a piard.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with sharia law.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, that is, "people to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can watch the emergence of the teocracy."
Many liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next Rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulems, but university students, some have studied in the French system" comforts Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be ambiguity in the scope of article 220 because the terms used therein are taken from religious lexica.
This applies, in particular, to the "fix" [Islamic jurisprudence - Rev.].
In the future, the question may arise as to how much civil judges are competent to rule on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have decreased significantly compared to those under the old regime.
Another controversial point is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be reviewed not in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been preserved and insults are now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, especially freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles speak of the protection of a woman anymore, highlighting Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
She said that the only positive development was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that has not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will, in turn, go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Earth's Pup and the sea from the rift.
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of Bible truth, modern comfort and the originality of nature.
AIF has identified five of the most important reasons for being in Israel.
Worship Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who goes into this bathship will be satisfied with God's blessing.
And Galileo is the place of Jesus ' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking through water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before his disciples and after resurrection.
But most holy things are in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here pass the Scorby Path or the God's Way of Jesus (at Latin - Via Doloros).
He begins at the fortress of Antony, Pretorium, where he was tried, and on the streets of the Old City brings to the Temple of the God's Coffin on Mount Golgof, to the site of Rascrius, the Stone of Posmonia, and the burial site of Jesus.
There is a symbolic Christian Earth Pup, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which a cross was made for Jesus ' crucifixion.
There is also the most holy place in Jerusalem for the Jews, the Wall of Placha, who remained from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes here with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of Massad's fortress remained hidden from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on curtain rocks in mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who engage in alpinism can get to them.
The rest of us on this historic summit are bringing the lift on the canal road.
And in the north of the country, there is a famous mountain resort, Hermon, which, during the winter months, is a huge influx of tourists.
He's got a bus tattoo coming from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mining highway is 45 km.
In an old tradition, pagan gods were said to have lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't go to all of them for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or the scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth staying at the Arts Museum in Tel Aviv.
His exhibitions are widely representative of the fields of Impressionists and Expressions of Mone, Pissarro, Renoara, Sezanna, Sislea, Matissa, Modillani, Chagala, Picasso.
In Akko, you can go to the Al-Bash Museum, which is a few halls of old Turkish baths with the mules of visitors and bankers of that time.
In Ceysaria, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum where you can see Dali and Roden's sculptures.
There are no guided tours and souvenirs.
Access is free and donations are not strictly accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Wash Museum in Tel Aviv, describes one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children's memorial, was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You go into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
Stars are dying.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Say hello.
The three main resort zones of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, aquakes, dolphins and oceanics.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees of heat and the air is warmed to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is still warm, and it's swimming around the year.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world at the lowest point in the world - 417 m below the level of the ocean.
The lazur water in it is a crucifix that is easy to keep even those who can't swim at all.
Drinking around isn't real beautiful.
They're coming here to undergo treatment with salt water - rapes, whole muds, and to heal health in decratitis, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchiths, diabetes sugar to bring the grinding nerves into order.
To touch the secrets of ancient times
They are stored by the old part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
It was a famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Greek legends.
By betrayal, this is where Noah built his ark, and Percey saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
The tourists are very fond of wandering on the narrow streets named after Zodiac's signs.
They say if you touch the walls on your own sign street, Fortune will be nice.
In Jaffo, young women come from all over Israel and even from other countries to a photo shoot.
And in Ceysariah, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre, "throw" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Casearia was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontia Pilate.
The safely restored theatre is now being used for evening concerts and opera performances.
To the traveler for the record.
As a reaction to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the population know Russian.
The money to travel is better than the euro, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for shekels (now US$ 1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a fast tram, and Haifa is the only subway line in the country consisting of six stations linking the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's an underground funiculer.
There are six shekels in all urban transport modes that can be driven with transplants for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday night to sundown on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease to work.
And on Sunday morning, the work week starts.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only cosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without garlic and food, in which milk and meat are combined.
It offers a large choice of ovine and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauce, milk-nut balloons - falall, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of feeding cats that's awfully "fucking on their own."
Tonight, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murleys love people's places and don't give up their treats.
The rental of the car, depending on the stamp, would be from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And a bike ride will cost 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
The citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine were most likely to travel and rest.
Between January and October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited Earth, 51 per cent more than in 2010, pending the withdrawal of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and mighty" to Moscow will lead migrants to cough money in their tongue.
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that they will give the Law on Compulsory Language Testing, there are already fraudsters selling "lip" certificates in the country.
Each year, 13 million Garstarbaiters come to Moscow, Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left in their homeland.
The Act entered into force on 1 December, requiring each migrant worker to pass the Russian language proficiency examination.
As long as this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing, domestic and retail sectors.
However, in time, they promise to the Navy, tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Not only does the language have to be given, but also the Russian history, and the basis of the legislation.
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed for both receipt and extension of work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a State language.
The law does not apply to persons who have been able to obtain certificates and diplomas on education prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Use, permanence and protection of rights
The network of examination points will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MPG, the SPbGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres had already been opened in Russia.
Both the members of the State Duma and the FMS supported the testing initiative.
And before the law came into force, human rights defenders asked the press many times: what would that really do?
What will change the bounds of language to both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration services respond to the decrease in the number of people suffering from "work slavery."
Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explaining Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federation Mission in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, an education that does not know a language without a medical examination.
Without an understanding of the language, "Sebelev, "the future migrant is doomed to face indecisive people who, under the guise of aid, will put him in a scary, tight bark, where he and dozens of people like him will be sleeping for months without food and documentation, putting 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In their home country, they are promised one thing, and on arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken, their salaries are not paid," confirmed by the Head of the Directorate General of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Labour of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, monkey!
However, as long as many of the citizens of the Middle Asian republics who are going to earn their earnings in Russia are recognized as not only not knowing the language of the country to which they aspire, but they are hard to write on their own.
Of course, it's not as much their fault as their troubles: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even to get a good primary education.
Because their families don't even have to feed children, let alone dress them properly, dress them and put them in school.
When they grow up to the age of adolescents, they go to work at the earliest opportunity.
It's hard if you don't know the language well, they admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
In the case of the Language Act, however, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the Hastarbayyrs continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or I'm not allowed outside."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and still the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money, ranging from 12 to 16,000 rubles.
You can make a fake registration quick and only for a hundred thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, no extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," was shared with journalists by a Tajik citizen, Umed Hushadanov.
"Pick it up, don't buy it, buy the painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several "lip" certificates for language tests have already been seized by FMS staff.
The fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they did not get to new owners: each of the migrants who had hoped to make it easier for themselves to pass tests paid 7,000 roubles for the document.
This is more than two times the cost of formal testing: it will cost a working migrant three thousand.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "browns" cannot simply be bought, shared by both the authorities and human rights defenders.
For the time being, the authorities can promise the Garstarbaytrams, who have failed to successfully undergo the first test, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take the illegal arms market into circulation.
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to strengthen the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to press shots at weddings when no casualties occurred, and a massacre by Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The cops want to ban injuries in public places and raise the age from which a licence for weapons can be obtained from 18 to 21 years.
Idea supported the head of the Thought Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yaroy, and promised that amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced to the State in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "heaking up."
An open letter had emerged on the network, which, through the authors of various public small arms organizations, called for the elimination of "indefensible tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with a registered weapon is minimal, declared by the Russian Service of Bi-bi-si a forensic lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov.
According to Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, in six months of 2012, 142 offences involving firearms registered with internal affairs agencies were committed, while 1,168,000 offences were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the area of civilian weapons does not place the offender in the black market.
They now say that any weapons can be found at low cost in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The Black Arms Market is being expanded through several channels.
The main channels are five, a colonel in the resignation of Victor Baranitz, who has worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Gentleman.
Scrinch of the site taking orders for weapons
The first is the "Armenian or military footprint," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were dragged by Russian officers and the Caucasus" says Baranitz.
The next type of "black gun" is stolen by criminals from members of the security forces.
The Baranian explains that this includes both the stolen police warehouses and stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illegal guns are being sold out of military warehouses.
There have been frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There is evidence that some of the arson attacks were made specifically to cover the gap," the former military says.
According to Baranz, arms manufacturers are contributing to their contribution.
"Some private weapons factories are now emerging that do not compete in the international market and throw weapons out of the floors into the black market, including Moscow," the expert explains.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's a production, sometimes a bush, and there's a mafia that organized the flow," explains the ex-military.
Where's the gun from?
The experts considered the approximate share of each source of illicit arms transfers in the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
The specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminal literature and the public data of the weapons portals.
The dominant part of illegal weapons is written by researchers and comes from the army and the security agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were "in the hands of officials whose work is related to weapons" in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of cases of weapons come from armed conflict, 14 per cent of cases involve arms theft, and 5 per cent come from black archaeology.
The consultant seller of one of the arms stores, who asked not to name him, assures him that the weapons found by the black cops have not been bought for a long time, too old.
Most often, as he says, the new shipment is followed by sellers going to the military warehouse.
A man buys a unit, like a TT gun, through a platoon.
He's being discharged, passed through the fence.
"He's bringing her to town and he sells 900 euros for a thing with two stores," he says.
"Yeah, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a crime-disclosure plan is on fire, they're in control with traffickers of illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"It's like a luxury store."
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the websites, the blogs, until a comrade called in, who offered to come to the God's platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the corner where we were trading.
I only learned the value of the gun there.
Military examiner Victor Baranitz
To get a gun, I need a friend who has an exit, says a consultant salesman.
The salesmen in the markets are there, but there's also a conditional, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell her daughter had a tooth fall."
I'm getting a couple of castes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He only delivers it to me, too, because he knows I'm not gonna give it up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former Military Victor Barantz tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article on this subject for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with pictures of "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranz, does not offer a cat in a bag, everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, don't just buy, we go with a salesman in the woods, put a target there.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the weapon beats well, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Couch shop
Searchers on the Internet go to websites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
That doesn't require any documents or personal meetings.
"A sufficient amount of money" is written in a promotional hat on the "Pupture a combat gun or machine gun" website.
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
And the minor's gonna be sold?
"No license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orphography retained).
"TT.Moskva Cup," Laconically formulates a request for Fedorenkov.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of sub-sites and wants to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they get to Siberia coal.
Military examiner and former Military Victor Baranitz
I've heard about these schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photograph and instruction where the weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, the press secretary of the public organization "Right to Weapons."
Victor Baranitz claims to have left the application on the website, you can stay unarmed and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of sub-sites and wants to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed and then get to Siberia's coal," he claims.
100-dollar Makarov
In the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be spent.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Weapons, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We're gonna have to wait a month and a half.
He's decommissioned from the warehouse of long-term storage by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to the official stages of the department, the number of such crimes in total decreased by 7 per cent in Russia from January to October 2011, to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported thefts and extortions of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the U.S., fastfood workers and supermarkets strike.
Through work on the MacDonalds register, it takes up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, America has experienced a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart and the restaurants of popular fast feeding networks such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Fried Cyken.
As long as no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth val or be expected to die in the early stages.
They support trade unions and a number of left-wing voluntary organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages paid to ordinary Walmart workers and the rapid feeding system, the aim of the protestors is to establish trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost excluded from the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by a cheap sale orgy that seized millions of customists and sometimes accompanied by snacks.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work around the world for 2.2 million people, left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores whose goods are read out to people of modest and medium quality.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from pellets, hunting guns and automobile batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his shops are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paying Walmart workers are only trained in their jobs.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheap in part because he doesn't pay his employees much.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the shortage of road loaders or manual scanners.
The participants on the Black Friday claimed a salary increase and complained that the cost of the company's health insurance had jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart worker who receives $9.5 per hour, this isn't in his pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost a $3.2 billion corporation.
It's about 1.1 per cent more than she's spending on her salary now.
If Walmart moves the entire salary growth on the buyer's shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more than that.
They'll spend $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart's supporters point out that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
The Black Friday continued in her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight next day, and then Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were carried out by its cashiers on the Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with Huffington Post's left site that jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest action had been just a "ordinary piarus trick" of the union that organized it.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart's universities (they do not complain in this progressive city, so they are not yet here), but by McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he's selling billions of porns, and then he doesn't even give you sick ones, and he doesn't pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their private workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this expensive town.
How can you exist in New York for money like this, it's not fair for me.
At one time, the McDonalds were able to go through almost a quarter of American teenagers who were working for their pillows after school while living with their parents.
Few saw the main source of food in this, or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly pressing for interviews with McDonalds who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal Forum, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're gonna feed them on.
The protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonalds on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of rapid food.
The American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with jerks and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it's difficult to reach the union's rapid diet for objective reasons.
One of the main things is the unusual turnover of staff.
Unconciliated
Smell protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The campaign was held in the middle of the day at the McDonalds meeting next to Times Square, where several local democratic politicians, in particular a member of the Jomaine Williams Council, said, "Macdonalds," said that he was selling billions of sentences, and then he wouldn't even give you sick and pay you for fair work!"
The demonstrators also supported other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor's candidate Bill De Blacio, who said that "we should be friendly in supporting fast-food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described, it was the largest act of this kind in the history of the United States rapid food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, not all of them were employees of a rapid generalist who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will produce a flame of mass movement.
"As long as the brain's cheated, it's medium."
The subject of the recently added reality, popular among the fans of modern technology, has been largely taken from the perspective of special points.
First in the summer of its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for the corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with the leader of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Laboratory, Microsoft Sharam Isadi, it follows that the glasses of the company are at an advanced stage.
Their vision of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general, what's your research team doing?
- We're working on a man's interaction with cars, but we're trying to spread the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as humanity's mass is stuck in the pixel phase on a flat screen, sometimes pointing a finger in them.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in sign management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite Kinect's physical interaction, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The release of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion has not yet been very good.
We're trying to change it, working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world to make it more tangible.
For this, however, we need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It certainly cannot be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises because it does not always want to educate others about its actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not the smashing ones, but the ones that were simplistic, short.
The gestures were not removed by a camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that fixed the movement of bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of handcuff hours.
But in fact, the future is behind a mixed type of control, such as a gesture of +-votes.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this soda can?
You'll tell me and show me at the same time.
- I'm usually just saying.
- Oh, it's gonna be really hard to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the car can or can't be doing for the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual convergence.
I think we're gonna have to work in the near future on the development of new types of sensors that will make it possible to better define human responses.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good deep resolution, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims for modern cameras?
Is there a lack of permission, depth, or something?
In principle, the present generation is what we can get away from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get megapikes 8 at a speed of 1,000 k/s.
But it's not the megapics themselves, it's as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, adding work to algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not just about the X and Y axles, but also Z.
The speed is also very important, the number of personnel per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are very small, especially for signers.
Stephen Betisches of our Radmond lab made a touch sensor with controlled processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how it affects human interaction and machinery.
I'd really use the equivalent of such a device in my work, but I don't need touch to have more staff per second.
- You don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other one is the receiver of the signal.
And now the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the apparent range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the crooked location of the cameras, and see how this would help in a three-dimensional definition of the position.
As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, in terms of the daily use of technology, the added reality of glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to walk around all the time, holding a smartphone in the hands raised, but I think the coolest option would be the "translator" complemented reality, when you could switch from the cliffs to the smartphone, the projection display and everything else.
The glasses are a very personal device, in which their power (privat things only you see) and at the same time weakness - the added reality based on points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's say for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the "Clear Man" but also to a simple mortal.
There's one problem that often points to criticism of this idea: there's no tactical retaliatory!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in human interaction and machinery.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactical feelings.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of a second hand as an image substrate.
She's got a great record of pressure!
But there are technologies that are really designed to give these "air carts" exposures - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located makes sense, but so far it's very weak - as if you've been given a pillow.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, too, a promising direction.
- Did you try to cheat your brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge to be fought for a long time - how to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that it is going on open, almost endless - to work on concepts of runways (not like clubs) moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as the brain's cheated, it's been working for a long time.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher - many things in a fully conceived state.
The taste of culture is Rosbalt.ru.
The Rosbalt is continuing a project on the "Peterburg Awangard" on the towns that are ahead of us in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top-page record has already featured prominent artists from the art scene of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, without all the Russian knowledge.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is a pathetic artist, Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a beard-dressed man dressed in all the red ones that meet at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashion party and the vermin.
Kirill Miller's paintings are always picking up a crowd of viewers wherever they go.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Peterburg socio-phylosofian fairymen, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the Poterburg Avangard of the late '80s - the early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets, causing a smile at the city hall, raising the mood.
Recently, he took the shaman into his hands and became a Petrburg charmer, as he was ripe for this complex role to all his divine existence, philosophy and imaginary.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in all the red, not in yellow or biruse, for example?
- I chose red as a modeler for view and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although in society everything that is not grey causes aggression and ungrateful ingenuity.
But my provocations are aimed at starting to talk.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you should be an artist?
- At the Nevsky DC exhibit where my work was displayed.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old free non-official artists passed, and the new, free kind of guys didn't understand me.
I became friends with artists of a new wave, with a post-gazone thickness that led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more waves.
I'm being thrown into theatre, clothes, music, all the genres, except the word.
- And all of this has come together in your Art Clinic... - I had to go to the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative powers must be gathered.
In 1995, I took over the territory of Pushkin 10, and there was a music art club, a goddamn club, a peterburg goddess's house, until it was repaired.
Many of them were born there, namely, the Mines, the Tequila Jazz, remember how Snura brought with the Uho Van Gogh project.
Snur and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in a tight trico, some of them were a fashionable contemporary composer, Igor Vdowin.
When the band played alive, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes until the time of the Haly-Ghali.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he went his great career, and he received basic education and education from us.
Gallery "D 137," Griboed Club is a bit of an art-klinic scapegoat.
That's where our employees went, and they're gone all over again.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of our City."
I was named "The God of the Year" in the nomination, and it ended with my culmination.
In new times, the old rules are uncomfortable working, I'm a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a familiar manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, and they're highly relevant and acute.
I'm gonna have a program show, Russ Museum in clowns.
Clowns are an out-of-date category.
I used to be social, being like this right now is painful and scary.
But in clowns, it's all depressing, tragicism is being removed.
I love Grotesk, I have Grotesk ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian change in order of command.
They're now meeting on a dress, focusing on an external mechanic, not on an internal person.
Maybe he can't get a hand in his face.
And the deception will be taken by dressing.
- And recently, we saw you as a city scrubber.
I don't want them to be.
- Maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactical, sweet.
Cultures are being disintegrated.
People used to run into packs, a goddess loved one thing, woke up another one.
Now everyone's broken into a microcommunity, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper to everybody like.
Now we need to think who's gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- A few thousand people come to Stasa Mihaylov!
- He's been abandoned, and it's a sex-social sphere that works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, money, all of them.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to ruin what's happening.
When I was young, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to Falc and Lariona hanged.
I started with paintings that usually end.
It's a lot of confusion right now.
They say culture is spiritual, a culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a man of culture yesterday, and I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint pictures.
I'm for a culture like this.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: a cultural official.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, the kings may not have understood much about culture, but they knew they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow right now.
We in Petersburg have people who could be experts, but they're delayed because we need higher experts who will properly appreciate these experts and give them a way.
It's delicious now.
The same Earart, but they're different from what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of thin.
We need to do fashion art, as was the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by a grant from St. Petersburg.
To be born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with the killer asteroid.
The caravanes of spaceships with earthmen are on board to search for a reserve planet.
In order to preserve humanity, is there a central question as to how to continue our kind in a state of underweight or on the same reserve planet?
I think it's not a big choice.
In fact, the real planets are only two that can be exploited at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," considered by the Senior Research Fellow of the State Astronomy Institute, P.K. Schternberg (GAISH), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more fit for life, on Venus surface, the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in Venus orbit... in space.
To approach the issues of reproduction in outer space began with flora.
A half-century ago, they experimented on plants.
Four generations of orbited peas were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then it's the orbiting of insects, tiny fruit fly drosophile.
In 1979, the eggs of the quails were sent to space to check how the embryo was developing under conditions of invisibility.
We get at the exit of a perfectly normal bird.
Now the problem begins.
"The problem that this bird needs to find a support is to get on its feet and move," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMB) RAN Vladimir Sich.
Without finding a backhold, the chicks were ripped off in a mess.
Ten hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not react to light and sound.
And there was trouble that four days later, they just died.
"And twice we used to spit the chicks out, and then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space, Vladimir Sich.
With animals, the last biological "miniccheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only have same-sex features.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent to space with fruit.
In principle, there's nothing supernatural in there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again it's a single experiment, and it needs to be done," Vladimir Sichev notes.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it's not yet possible to address the proliferation problem directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their traditional habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was that of Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could say if he could survive the space flight.
If she can have a baby after this flight.
"No one answered this question," the veteran of the Vakhtang Wachnadze missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight to space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.
Andrian Nikolayev's father was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitzka, the second female cosmonaut, was born a son twice in orbit and even working in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have much, we have some cosmonauts that have gone through long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," the result is the pilot-kosmonaut, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of the Russian Federation, Valery Polakov.
Yet mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The COD Hydrolaborator is a mandatory phase of preparation for the flight.
Here, under zero melting conditions, cosmonauts learn to work in outer space.
Water simulates invisibility.
If adult water is comfortable, but it's a different environment, it's a family thing for infants.
The little nicotires seem to confirm that life has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is about nine months old in her mom's window fluid, and it's easier for him to get used to the vodka later.
In principle, it's logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, it's only been two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenov's breastfeeding instructor.
By word, if the child's birth is more weightless than the natural condition, the woman needs gravity and gravity.
The muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, the ability to push the fruit, are shaking very quickly in the invisibility of the foetus.
All right, let's put this down, relying on birth-feeders.
You can, of course, go to a special ward, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks Valery Polakov's intriguing questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of earth's tension, the body does not form a skeleton and a mouse system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special loading suit for training.
He'll just be deprived of his vital need.
"And this experiment, which you and I are going to do by allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person who is completely disadapted to the Earth," the head of the Bioethics Committee of IMBP RAN Igor Pestov will see.
As long as the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
However, after a time, it will be a reality when the earthers on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit and Audit Office: Verification of the shwarz system failed by the fault of politicians.
The Czech public procurement industry has good control authorities and, despite the existence of quality legislation, has been lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the Aktuálnë.cz website.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct, which I think we lack," commented on the current situation of Kala.
The joint inspection of Czech and German control authorities provides such opinions.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Nehhour's approach to the so-called shwarz system is evident.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (the Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - was it prohibited or permitted?
"The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions that are under the obligation to verify and enforce obligations" notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was that about?
It means a parallel check that we started two years ago.
In short, European law argues how public procurement should take place, national legislation should be followed and then also applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even if it has not yet been verified, there are interesting differences - simply to say, we may have "right and wrong" legislation, but in the practice of applying some of the parameters, we are taking Germany away.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project really help you what it means to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're gonna achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps the system will be expanded to "bumags" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not fall.
You refer to internal problems with the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany function?
Is there an organization like our CIA (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
With regard to institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, also has a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate in the same way.
In addition, powers to some extent are similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal Länder, their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only run federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are monitored at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it easier than we do?
Actually, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take the sample, but it can't be clearly said that it's better in everything.
Is it because they're better off controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage of cooperating with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, in some way, have consequences been shown?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it has not yet manifested itself in our verification work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We're taking this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections -- we're starting to use our new tool to "detect the risk of uncertainty" through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts -- we've analysed them -- and there's, of course, these changes, because there's a change in restrictions, changes in the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or add to the pressure on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules "will become hard" and will not be respected.
In the operation of previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional council) that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be strengthened in such a way?
I think it's not that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect the solution.
Such a system would only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GPD would not bother entrepreneurs with the checks of the so-called shwarz system.
"Swarz System" is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibited anything, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies that were required to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but we can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains fairly strict rules, as and what must be formally implemented, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be correct, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly, they're coming in, but someplace with more caution.
Carlowar Province
This morning, the road was in the Carlowar region, but some are frozen and snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it must warm a little.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, and only the lowlands have a small layer.
However, there are about 30 centimetres of snow on the Ridges of the Rud Mountains.
According to information received from regional road workers, places were found to be less visible due to fog.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently under way without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be lethal and slippery.
Also, all roads in the second and third classes, including mountain routes, are passing through.
But in some of their areas, there are still remnants of frozen snow and places of snow.
Special attention should be paid to the roads on the highlands.
Pardubitzk and Kralovegradsk Province
The management of Czech roads and highways on their pages on the Internet informs that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are in danger of hololed and that the snow may be planted on mountain roads and roads located on the highlands.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a hololede that can be formed especially at the heights of the Pardubic province.
Holold may be near Lanshkrun, Usti nad Orlica, Polici, Swevivi or Visoka Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located at Sweetawi, have been processed by chemicals.
Especially snow is on the roads of Krkonosh and the Orlic Mountains.
The snow is located on roads located on the hills in the districts of Rihnova nad Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In the East Czech Republic today, the variable cloud is not rain-free.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pleasure
Roads in the Plesen province this morning are accessible, but places need to be careful and adapted to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places, it may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 highway is now almost unrestricted, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and extinct surfaces.
In the southern Plji and Tahove, the permeable areas may be found.
The second and third-class roads are wet, and there is also a warning that slippery sites may be available.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the few roads used in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region must today take account of the snowbed on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogord Sedle and on the road towards Vivele Krshija.
The snowfall forced road workers to enter the street at night, according to road management, about three centimetres of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other parts of the edge of the road, it is generally not restricted.
"In the hills of Schumperk, there are snow residue.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should bear in mind the presence of snow caskets in the Chervenogord Sedle," CHAN (the Czech News Agency) reported today a sounder road control dispatcher.
On the night when the roads were cleared, their colleagues from Esenick went, and they believed that the roads on the hills after the chemicals were processed remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are not restricted, but in Sternber, drivers must be careful in forest areas where humidity still persists.
Ustek Province, Libereck Province
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are several difficult places left.
According to the police database, in addition to several hololed or snowed places, the mountain road from Telnica to Klinice in the Ustek province has been closed.
The temperature is also negative in the lowlands, so there is still snow and ice on the roads, and in the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Gorge, there are no problems, but mostly dry roads.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of hololed in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions were created for his formation at night, raining and snowing all day, the sky was clear and froze began to begin at night.
Disadvantages were reported on the main highway and on track I/13 on the border of the Usteck and Libereck province.
Owing to the snowed branches of trees on the road itself, they were forced to close the road to Telnica on the Knnica.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy.
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people are getting so easily on.
Together with The Tap Tap, we keep kidding on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give a completely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you give more details about this to readers?
This is a national fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of Maya's calendar, which was announced on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20th, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava were opened in parallel at 9:00.
They will end, to say awfully, at a time when the May calendar will be completed on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, whose watch belt is 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who's got this idea in mind?
Initially, it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusto.
Apart from the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of this world that we will once hand over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the Light is Cancelled."
Will an anthem of these benefis concerts be heard by YouTube's already in love?
Of course, at the very end, if things end up and the end of the world doesn't come.
He's gonna get drunk by all the actors at all the concerts at the same time.
The Gimns will also be sounded live on Czech television.
The words to this song wrote and played Jesus ' role in the video of Tomash Gank, and also participate in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural personalities, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What's the profit of the concert against the end of the world?
To buy equipment for the STUDEO non-barrier education centre, for the sixth year we've been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlicka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit and carry out fun and interesting activities with students at the Edlicka Institute.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the Edlicka Institute ' s additional construction project, a separate building will be established in the future to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will be attended by several music groups and singers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to draw up a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Maryan Bango and Irji Suhi will appear in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "grandisome activities" in the future?
In May, we'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and, of course, we'll prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
As for the abroad, you have serious plans, you've already done in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electrical wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and tools boxes.
However, as long as we've been able to deal with this without any problem, the Czech Airlines ČSA and British British Airways have always been excellent for us, which has surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we just came back, it went without a problem.
Through overseas visits, you can compare different countries with regard to accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east we are still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are many barriers in Moscow, and there is still an independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
Also, there's not a lot of bathy things out there like putting a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people ' s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, do we always have to catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind the level of performance.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal that people with severe disabilities move on their own streets, can go to the bathroom, museum, anywhere...
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, and that's why we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or non-barrierry is one thing, but at a time when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will be among us, then everything will really start to change.
As long as it's a single case, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap group is now very popular, but we'll be back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlicka Institute as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I'm playing on a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our lead Ladha Angelovich says, it's a little out of control.
It's only in recent years that popularity has come, or am I confusing?
That's true, we've been helped by joining famous singers and actively working to promote the group.
We have concluded that the work that no one can assess is essentially as if there was no one.
With the European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of making the Tap Tap so good?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in Shaw Business that imitates one other.
It makes sense that all new things are taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us is, of course, pity, is natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering and all the abandoned individuals we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not just for them, but for the whole community.
Has success been achieved by what you are a strong leader, what many consider you to be?
If we want to do a job of quality, we must be in many things uncompromising and have some discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At present, the Tap Tap group is composed of twenty people.
How many were in early 1998?
There's only one Ladha Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba Stadium, Brno at the Fledda and Ostrava Club, at the Plynojem Center, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected with the television host at the time of the song of The Tap Tap, "The End of the Light Is Canceled."
The aim of the project is to raise funding of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional non-barrier equipment for the STUDEO education centre at the Edlicka Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of age, free entry, and tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, the Ministerial Meeting of the European Space Agency of Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after Czechoslovakia, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has actively participated in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
But Poland's journey to space began a long time ago.
Before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were on space flights, but it was not always with understanding.
I would like to recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, which, on 6 December 1933, presented ideas in Warsaw's astronomical observatory from its innovative work "Installation in outer space."
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadovsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Award for Space Education.
Dr. Jan Gadovsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned space promoter, and his contribution was assessed, including by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named in his honour.
As early as 1925, Poland had built a rail Dresin equipped with a missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as was the details of the project.
It is not even clear that a rocket was to be used to disperse or braking the trolley.
Information about this dreary is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Meegev Wolfke and Gustav Mojiczki.
The remaining material shows that research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, a photovoltaic user rocket proposed by Engineer Rogozinski appeared in a specialized press, and the following year the work of the Air-Torped and Air-Bomb missile of the author, Lilia-Kwiboblocko, was launched.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war itself, all missile military projects were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on space appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauticzne).
For the first time, reference is made to society in the November 1954 issue of the Problem magazine, which publishes four large articles on astronauts.
In one of these, Professor M. Subotović proposed the organization of a space society.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (based in 1951) and has become a valid member of the PAA in the autumn.
Next year, the first chairman of PAA, Kazimèz Zarankevich (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death, which took place in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful RAM meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteologiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket capable of overcoming the distance of 1,800 m was about 80 cm long and was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bladov desert in the summer of 1959.
The missile was about 1.4 m long and was about 11.5 kg in weight.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have overcome 14.5 km and its mission was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The first RM missile was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-step rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed and differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Meteor-1A rocket had 0.4 litres of space, Meteor-1B was 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C had 0.62l.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a start-up weight of 380 kg was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Mention should also be made of Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The decree generated a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in labour costs (paying fees) there is price stress.
This concept needs to be understood when a producer, through the delivery of a cheap commodity, tries to resist economic competition by "battering" the value of a rival in order to take over most of the market and thus increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move production abroad, either cheap purchases abroad or disappearances, resulting in increased unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, there is an increase in the State ' s inevitable social spending.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of masters to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and economic damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that no specific statistics need to be provided.
Unceremonized private capital practices create situations at the level of the economies of individual States where Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population with a view to attracting foreign capital.
In other words, Governments give their own people arbitrary private capital despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in existing legislation.
The aim is to make their people economically subject to the private capital dictatorship, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a tool to curtail workers ' rights in the area of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing, while the gap between the poor and the rich is increasing.
There has been a public distribution of products to poor people in the FWG for several years, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labour.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of German economic competitiveness, there are always instances in which employed persons receive such wages that the State must pay them to receive a minimum of subsistence.
This scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same condition that people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a niche salary on the back of society, hoping that private investment capital will come to the country someday.
But you wonder where he's gonna come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the share of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim to be nauseous that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not act as managers to interfere in the economy.
Further, the question should be asked whether private capital, now a practical policy manager and the whole State, was working for their own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of virtually inclusive and inclusive lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an unprecedented situation in corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where virtually everyone deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In the FWG, the situation is that government ministries, owing to lack of financial resources, are tasked with drafting legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
Then these bills are approved by Bundestag.
The whole power is not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now fast in a situation as described by Appian in the "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeia": "The State has long collapsed, and agencies are engaged in violence.
Takings, illegal getting of mercy with stones and swords.
Patience and corruption flourished without any ban, and the people went to elections with a pre-selled voice" ...that decent people did not run for the position of governor at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months. " Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-power and the need to choose a strong man. " Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it became Caesar, who finally changed democracy to self-power.
As in ancient times, today's society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The current result is no different from the past: the wanton decline of the elite without any effort to reform a deeper character.
So the cause of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the reckless liberalization of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, followed by the next round.
Above all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a decision or, at least, not a permanent decision.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is thus systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s role in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"It's not gonna work out of violence, and it's never gonna come out," Sting, "The Big" song, where the main poem of refren is, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted war, they wouldn't have been" - the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has generated many responses.
Some are in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence and that the Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli State is racist, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is bound by the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurrent waves of murder, is a criminal, and who the victim, after all, today ' s Israeli citizens, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and were not witnesses to the violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who has been serving 95 years of tension (based on the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East land.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of contemporary history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne someone who has guided their actions towards the intended goals.
We must be allowed to live at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not occur in the lives of one generation.
An astronomically rich family is single, which could be seen as the head of the sprut (I don't know if anyone's standing above them, but it's not excluded) - Rothschilds.
There's a lot of things they don't write about.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s to stop the rumours linking their name to criminal actions in the higher areas in which they were in the shadows, and which had always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or both.
They have large shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have a share, they carry out or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were five countries, with only four remaining after the overthrow of Qadhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue his own money (possibly government money) and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy started releasing his own money and wanted to cancel FED (federal reserve system) was killed in 1963; deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for breaking the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their desire for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by Albert Pike, the Great Mason of the 33rd Level.
The goal of the first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially of Great Britain, and the third should result in a reduction of the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion (this number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenicalism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by Rothschilds, works is the challenge of crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (ordre ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by launching a Bolvik Revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, military and economic breakdown by Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austro-Wengria, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing enormous military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a precipice for radicalization of the impoverished masses, then only left the Germans with a strong enough character, describing the perpetrators and proposing simple solutions to the Chief, further creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed played the function of the Fifth Column in fuelling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judah with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a preposterous message for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, beginning with the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had come out of chains in which bankers had originally held him or what he had done had been planned, in any event, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was formally founded in 1948 and, as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was declared to create a third-party war.
If the international bankers can untie it, the Jewish people, like in the Second World War, will be the victim of fighting on the front line, now with the Arab or, simply speaking, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (a sharp division of people into Israeli supporters and opponents).
Who is responsible, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the resentment results in an endless chain of violence if it all begins with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish ordinary Israeli people from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are handing people over to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Jayb Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascist, loyal international bankers as a politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20% of the world's total oil reserves (the ship's corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words given by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their introduction is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted by a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have a brand on his right hand or on his forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither sell nor sell.
Here's wisdom: everyone who has reason can calculate the number of animals.
For it corresponds to the human name, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo" film: When there's nowhere worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamic demontenants captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, there was no positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not in a position to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The prisoners ' diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiations facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate has triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980s presidential election, which culminated in Ronald Reagan's election.
The film cut by actor Ben Afflek "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the history of America's small wins.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy, six employees escaped.
After complex feathers, they ended their way to the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover legend, according to which they were travelling on Canadian passports as members of a surveying group who had found a place in the country to survey a scientific and fantastic era.
A combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's Evacuation expert invented called for Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, and press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, the film, based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Afflec's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political trillion, the so-called "film-kinoopus," the story of a good idea, the cone, could be an example of a series of films about Oushen's friends.
The film constantly changes the moods - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (the titres show the symbolic historical pictures of events and the way the same situations were shown in the film - there are no major differences in this).
On the other hand, eased by the Hollywood sections, crossing with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, at the agency ladders, on the phone...
Ben Afflec has been able to make a great career restart.
From a mocked actor, he became a respected director, and his game stopped being the object of ridicule.
"Argo operation" is his third full film, after a dark detective, "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and "City" pilot (2010).
At the same time, this is Afflec's first film, which is not filmed in the home city of director, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place applies to the qualities that raised earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflec is showing it to Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events, the opening scenes of the Embassy's fall impress their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and uncertainty that arise when history changes suddenly.
The effect of Afflec and his colleagues is similar to that of the fictional (subsequent headquarters on the Tehran bastard).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not involve many exciting scenes of kinematic importance.
He's pretty successful with this little, sometimes something comes up, and it doesn't seem so elegant (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the run-up on the runway looks pretty smart).
The weakness of the Argo is the dispersal of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Afflec's film lacks a little drama, it's a film that can be seen with moderate interest, assessing the production and retro-styl that recreates the trillions of the '70s.
But it's hard to capture.
But this is enough to remind you of one, still in the known sense of living history, as well as to show how the perception of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services is exaggerated.
Air balloons, bananas and circus injection rules
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to declare a competition for "the most absurd order or project from the EU workshop."
"We have moved towards this recent event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said "Pravu" by the interviewer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities that have already been nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Women still had life insurance benefits because they were objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"The best incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place before the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The EU ' s controversial orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which is harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the chicken cell, which has significantly cost eggs this year.
Also criticized was the de facto ban on the use of the term "buterbron oil" or the removal from the sale of classic lamps.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic is now even threatened by its banks).
The interests of the lobby are such: for example, the top-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and failed to show "anomalous curve."
In doing so, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it was only harmonizing existing fragmented national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has nonetheless reduced the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to the dispersal of products.
The EU Regulation last year may be the candidate for winning the survey, according to which selling balloons must be warned that children under the age of eight cannot blow them without adult supervision.
The EU has approached American research according to which balloons in the game are the potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are prohibited from blowing into garlic ducks.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: everyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and should instead say "BURM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the unification of liberal economists, "The Principle of Non-intervention" (Laisez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the size of food stocks in the territory of the State.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food that may be available in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the levels of preservative mushrooms, for which it was facing a large fine.
The interviewer ' s organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting grants.
But these ideas came up in Prague, not Brussels.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
Let's ask the European Union for compensation," stated in autumn 2004 by the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (CDP).
He argued that there had been a high harvest of grain in the country and that, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the State had had complete stock warehouses that needed to be removed.
For being far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission has approached the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for grain from landlocked countries.
Grants for the grant were offered to the villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such grants should have been made for the drawing up of a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Delicious Orders are an exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as the more efficient functioning and development of the EU, are considered by many experts to be more worthy of recognition.
A major problem, in the view of the experts, is the drawing of EU grants to projects that do not even have an indication of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the budget discussions.
The Czech Republic, as in other European Union countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Australians, retained the name "Olomotic cheese," but the "Toumemian rum" whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Tuzemak."
Only can be called rum from the cane dystillium, not from the sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world's known cheese "feta" and "horgondsol," the German Lubek marzipan or the Parma hamlet, for example, the carlowar dryers, the burner and the trichebonic carp and the yellow hamle have already been found.
The EU's trademark may also be proud of the paradubic hide and the burning tubes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think to run for president?
I don't think about being senator or president myself.
If everything worked in the country without problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't see how the country has been turning around in the past 20 years, how thieves, people are growing up in taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent person who doesn't belong to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things except to run for senator or president.
You got caught in the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've always said I'm gonna fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
Later, I explained that if I were to be elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a post, a post is an instrument by which I can exercise my views.
That's why I need the greatest influence and authority.
But the problem is not only that we're a nation rushing at our bar or TV, but they're willing to melt up anyone who's gonna try to change something.
This is added to the media, which decapitate people, and that confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was bribed by journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubek.
Let's go to your eyes.
The fight for the presidential castle started with allegations of political and criminal responsibility and negative property declarations above twenty million.
In order to do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for the conduct of tours to become a free business, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or on the right - he is deliberately hindered, and it keeps citizens from doing so.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is the best thing for our country, without a half-rolling, without looking at the Dogs.
Do you think you're more of a person who's right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I feel like people think I'm more of a left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
It's not that someone's right, but someone's left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether the HRCM or the GPD will offer it, and I will also oppose the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And you're trying to get close to it.
You can call it populism, but all the suggestions I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or the eminent experts are talking about them.
But without the support of Parliament, only slogans will remain for you.
And you're not gonna stay in politics with that.
Or do you think that when you come to people and talk to them, you will be able to exercise criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve our own.
Had I been elected President, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell us why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality that speaks out of abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President - it was a credit for the pressure of the public.
I'm saying directly that I'm an amateur, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to resist my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just starting politics, and I'm gonna try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to move on my own; if this is not possible, I'll end up in six years and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Ocampo has to save Czechia.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not gonna do anything, so I've gone over a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, and he refused because of the heavy workload.
Also, at least I supported journalist Jan Lorenzov's lead investigation, who discovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm on weight.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the elections, and most of those who went to the elections chose representatives.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate to make changes difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the purity of the past of every potential supporter, and I don't have any money for it.
No money for the presidential campaign, only twenty thousand kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a property in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of works of about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Scod Superb for a million, and a few million more.
By the way, Aston-Martin showed up because it was my boy's dream, and I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, was a gallant with women, and at the same time fought against paltry and lawlessness.
You go to Aston Martin, you own 60 million worth of property, and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from my pocket.
The campaign costs will actually cover my senatorial salary.
But for that money, I wouldn't have lived, for example, to pay my son for an English school worth 30,000 monthly.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're gonna be doing business next so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down that activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the travel agency in spring.
People would like me to be a silversmith who's gonna keep the republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to receiving monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which goes on.
And if I were to become president, I'd have finished my entrepreneurship.
You'll find a full interview on the Saturday issue of Law.
MVRDV architects prove that the actual adventures are not just in the imagination - the example of Spacekenisse and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photographs
"I think this building is funny, it looks futuristic, finally you can see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaiga, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large enterprise, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I'm asking myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one's going to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spacekenisse, a small sleeping town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate situation, it was decided several years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are shown on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatur from ferrobeton.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city's dads realized that they had the only chance to beat the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas from the Rotterdam Architect Bureau MVRDV, the master of bold column diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, went to the task with his usual impatience and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under a mouse and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked back and pressed their shoulders, the mad Maas laid off his original pyramid gift in size, and finished the speech in defence of their project with the following words: "Loved by the people of the city!"
Here it is, my suggestion is, "The Book Mountain" in Spacekenisse, what's called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, postage and several adjacent housing units and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was marked by the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Woods Competition.
Thus, a small suburb that had never been able to offer anything other than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an amazingly incredibly incredibly non-redientic structure, whose white facades suggested a milk factory, became richer in one modern works of architecture.
But most importantly, the first public cultural building in the history of this town appeared in Spacekenisse.
Long road to the book
First impression: Eldorado's bookstore under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of the mountain, because real architecture and reading fans will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The area covered from all sides is light and lightly foreseeable, the floors of a burnt brick and the elegant street lights are inexcusable to the public urban area.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
It's not easy looking for benches, dogs and football boys and girls.
And everywhere are books, books, books.
"The usual book regiments are standing along the façades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually soft and silent," says Vini Maas.
We put a classic configuration of space from the head and pulled out the reading area from the inside.
The inner space of the book mountain has been used with skill: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities are located in the centre.
The black book regiments that serve as a separation of walls, parapets and stairwells are particularly excited.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and builder engineers are lost in guesses, which is an unknown material.
"We have sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spacenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And one time at an agricultural enterprise in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, artificial fibres of millimetre thickness have been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and saves time.
The thin textile serves one or two seasons, and then it can be thrown out.
For the library, it's the first time in this volume, it was crushed in a four centimeters thick panel.
Under the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) is turned into dark, homogeneous, solid material, smelling a little bit of a new car and a little sneaker.
There are 105 steps leading to the top.
Those who travel nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wood chips in the pots.
They care about the atmosphere, especially the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
New soul costs
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is used for heating and cooling.
Even though the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun only enters for a short time.
Large cleavage farms, perpendicular to glass façade, offer shadows and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above as an IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaig was also here.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spacekenisse, which was long overdue."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to contribute one book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to be empty on the shelfs of an uncompleted library, which at that time had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The floors are loaded upstairs.
"There's nothing worse than a half-pound library," says the architect Vini Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, everyone now has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for jewelry.
Thus, MVRDV has achieved a royal task, which is called identity creation on a professional roast.
Spieskenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point to build identity.
Sabo: "The Germans have a more important role to play."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the U.S.-Europe liaison expert, doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany must now be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think she supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the voting on the establishment of a no-flight zone.
In the end, NATO made this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from a policy that the US has managed to a German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of coherent unified policies among Europeans.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that for the time being they have only felt their role, but they are on the road to "more normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy of France or Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interest that is independent of the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore defend its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to insult the public and elites in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it's not entirely one-sided.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relationship with the US by refraining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I'm sure in Europe and even in the United States there is a greater understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are differing views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has made clear its support for the veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European States?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a strong understanding of the European position.
But in view of the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama isn't really excited about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, Germans would be a little easier if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it isn't.
They are therefore unable to take a broader approach and are forced to act instead on the basis of their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.
This subject has always been tickling.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take the lead?
Or is the leading role still hard for Germany?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still always in trouble and, for obvious reasons, it has always been difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
The Germans aren't just dealing with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, then who remains?
The Germans will just have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's life if you don't like it.

China's trademark security: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a worldwide brand of trade, and the Polo Ralph Lauren is also known.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names bring a claim.
But it is also unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of trademark rights in the Far East.
I've got a new case of this kind on my desk every week.
It's enough for the simulators to add just a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci gets Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the producer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the office of trademark registration in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered Zegna DF Puma's trademark, an artificial name that also used the name of Ermenegildo Zegna's fashion house.
What Chinese are the world champions of copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
There are multi-storey universities in the big cities that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloh's cases are not the same, on instructions from his trustees, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese enterprises are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected somewhere else by the office of registration of trademarks.
The Chinese call it "bang-pike," mark-passer.
This word is associated with the Ban Dakuan.
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not plead guilty.
"It hurts business, it needs to be fought," Pattle's conviction.
"The brand is blurring, the unique position is lost, the image is suffering very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with a sales volume of Euro15 billion a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to obtain the removal of questionable records in the trademark registry, and it is expensive.
The process may last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattoloch refers to cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long time, the contested name became "market reality."
If the plaintiff isn't lucky, he'll even have to pay the plagior because he's damaged his trade sign in China, says Pattle.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a litigation with the Sany construction car manufacturer, an enterprise that had recently acquired a concreteonos producer Putzmeister.
So the Chinese still have the right to use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The owner of Volvo, Geely, originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful; Geely had to change it.
Lacoste's fashion product manufacturer lost his role in China to the architects from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 owing to the lack of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from emergency to normal" process.
For example, the number of untreated objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending before the agency.
Fighting this is expensive.
As often as in China, numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has, for the tenth consecutive time, taken over the list of new registers worldwide, reports to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
There are many times more to challenge it, as the German family company Freudenberg has shown.
For more than seven years, the connor has fought against the Chinese plagiator.
The Germans have succeeded in ensuring that their illicit manufacture of forged car parts has been eliminated.
However, the simulator has secured Chinese rights to the freedenberg trademark.
This was his own omission, because the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the board, Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Authority rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both of the following, Freudenberg won, but the opposing side is still struggling.
We need to keep an eye on it.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes away a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic costs are unlikely to be accounted for, the firm ' s archive has had to examine even a hundred years ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg failed to offer the opposing side a "more six-digit euro" for settlement.
"It's clear from here how expensive it is for us," Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to move even to Europe.
That is, if the simulators register undefensed trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but had nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
"It's necessary to keep an eye on," Ventzler says.
Both he and counsel Pattleh recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, but rather foreigners should "all that is worth protecting, also registering in China" says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trade sign drama, then he's gonna have to pay the opposite side a licence fee for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: drowning, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, he rehearsed the choir of Imbongi, and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoiced.
A history of relationships that have crossed the distance of more than 8,733 kilometres.
First it's flooded: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up a cabbage on the park floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then slowly increase the voices of singers - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, charm and follow each other.
And Fita Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pulls out of his math shoes when he runs them with flexible and express gestures.
The night of Monday, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi rehearsals a new song.
Fifty choir participants from 23 to 69 years of age came to the rehearsal, from a human genetic specialist to a palace.
Om Obani is a difficult thing, every choir voice has its own text, also in a completely alien language: Zulus, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, United Nations AIDS programmes have estimated around 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Eitzheni, the Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school preparing for further education.
In 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the chiefship.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and daily hot lunch at Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu is a storywriter or a admirer.
They don't talk about running into a bathtub in this room, but they can sing.
For almost 10 years, the choir has taught songs in this soft language and, from time to time, even brings them back to where they first appeared: south of Africa.
The village of Esitzheni, which depends on the German choir, is located at a distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw cabins, and many children among the inhabitants.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the IH virus.
In Esitgeni, a miniatur disease affects Swaziland as a whole: the highest level of HIV infection, the world ' s lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF data.
The cutting of the flesh among men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population has a virus of immunodeficiency virus, and death is not rare in the middle of the fourth dozen.
Hor opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but first Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but also just food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private obligation of individual participants to send a child to school in several euros a year and to allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voice for Africa, which has since been providing almost professional care for AIDS orphans in Esitzheni.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI is characterized by syphilis, chlamydiasis and tripper.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are frequent viral STIs.
The pedicular pediculosis and garlic refer to parasitic STIs.
What are the major target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koh's Institute assumes that at least four of the five syphilis registered in Germany are the result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often have sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamidic infections, trichomonias, candidoz (gybone), gonorrhoea and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamidic infections are much higher than among other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also see human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the incidence of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms of venereal disease?
Infectable diseases may cause ulcerations in the area of genitals, complaints in the form of urine, discharge, pain below the abdomen, and bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain invisible.
How can you defend yourself?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of contamination but do not provide 100% protection.
In view of the fact that some sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular surveys, especially when sexual partners are often changed.
In early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and remote effects avoided.
Chefs, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany, allow us to collect something.
"Everything we've sent to Eitzheni is about 200,000 euros," says Annete Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is administered by Zod Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares for orphans to be well arranged, such as one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it on the Zulus old women, is the village's pillar.
Some have accepted up to 14 orphans, provided them with a roof over their heads, and ensured that children in uniform appear on time every day.
Those who have no family are taken to a shelter for Hanijsil, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two smokers and, together with the American Health Organization, PSI organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-mandated lifestyle is also responsible for the spread of the IHF virus so quickly in previous years.
But it's also on stray workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annete Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, Ibmogney's choir travels every two to three years in south Africa and sings songs full of sadness, spirit, confidence and black consciousness, which many in the southern province of the Black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip also leads to Esitgeni, where the singers visit their children.
Despite the difficulty of finding a small village on the map, it is more than known in the valley of the Etsulveni River.
"Go to Esitgeni, there's light," the people here say.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the top singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also on fire here.
Namssenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messinger Zond found evidence that there's ice on Mercure's planet.
The ice cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA's space agency has proven ice on Mercure's planet.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messinger Zond has found evidence that the planet's constantly undercover region is covered with ice.
Its thickness must be at least 30 centimetres, possibly up to 20 meters.
The water is supposed to be coming from a comet or possibly an asteroid facing Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the Sean Solomon Zone.
Mercury temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building elements of life have hit other parts of the solar system.
The Earth's inhabitants of probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, do not notice the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: little windows to endless ones.
Image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as a dwarf planet of the Church.
Like Pluto, who comes around the Sun for Neptune, the Church, by a new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a "plane."
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a family portrait of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue, it is more difficult to identify pink "new" stars in the star circle.
This star formation region, which scientists call it W5, is discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopei, at a distance of 6,500 light years.

One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble Telescope: Waterworth galaxy
Depending on the color operas, the images of the spiral galaxy become real works of art.
A photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows Trifid's vagueness over several thousand light years in the constellation of Streltz.
Trifid's name comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dollar, three-dividus), because the dark layers of dust are divided into three parts of the broken heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Miracle, astronomers photographed the precursor of a space collision: 400 million light years away from the Earth, the core of the two galaxy is facing each other and will inevitably be faced.

Someone who doesn't like technical cuts can call it "South Cool" by name.
A picture of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Irice's nebula in the constellation Cefaus.
The nebula distance of 1,400 light years consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This image was derived from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring from a black hole that is 430 million light years away from Earth.
This galaxy group, called Arp 273, photographed the space telescope Hubble for NASA.

It's a star cloud connected to Rosett's nebula, and it's also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There's no dust in this bright light galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it arose just before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our View of the universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey before Galileo Galileo began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown increasingly - and the space available to them has grown deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the San Diego Observatory was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Big Biocular Telescope is installed.
It allows space to be viewed using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The Grand Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device, with a mirror diameter of 10.4 metres.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce the cost.
However, it reaches about 11 metres in diameter.
Deficiencies of low-cost design performance: the telescope is rigidly attached to the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It's special: high-lighting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Through a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to extra-Earth signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the extraterrestrial intelligence project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Astronomy Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's a big telescope standing here, completely corresponding to its name.
His four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be covered in the visual tube.
It is also planned to install a European Big Telescope in the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror shall be broken to an entire 42 metres, and shall be made of almost 1,000 mirror pieces.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mawn Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of 30 metres should appear on Mauna Kea.
They can look at the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system - especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photos record the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not before 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and the galaxy.
Scientists suggest there's ice on the southern Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as Messinger moves closer to the northern pole of the planet.
For decades, radiation measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messinger Zone launched in 2004, the first one that revolves around Mercury is now certain of it.
Drink butter every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people have reached a biblical age.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Searching for a mystery in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people have reached a biblical age.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Searching for a mystery in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talish Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The microbus, with thunderstorms, runs through the fenced road past the thick forests of the hills, the brown rivers, and the simple peasant houses.
Everyone around here is so green and bright that you might think you're in Schwartzwald.
But this is Azerbaijan's southernmost edge, the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
There are talyses, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is known to be few, except for what they speak beautifully in the Farsi and Azerbaydian and are long-term.
The final point is Lerick.
A small town is chasing too heavy Soviet architecture, which does not agree with the painting mountain landscape at all.
European tourists hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too exhausting.
It takes eight hours to 323 kilometres, because the road has only one strip.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea is here, to the province, until it's made it.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is nothing to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku was famous for the Eurovision song festival, and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulaev.
She's the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biographical record of about eight dozen of these places, which are more than 100 years old, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
That's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the Cheranali Muslumov Chaban, who was allegedly 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
In view of the fact that the oldest person whose age has been confirmed is 122 years old, the age of Müslumova seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in the area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136, he allegedly had a daughter.
So did Muslum's chaban add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Schultz, a age researcher from Max Planck Institute in Rostok, heard of long-dollars in Central Asia.
"A remarkable number of older people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Schultz, "there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there is no scientific proof of age because there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of heating oil
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerik area are surprisingly often reaching Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age living here.
Why are there so many long-terms here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide, Farid Mugimzade, explains this by special talysh genes.
The director of the Fatulayev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about nutrition.
Talyshi like meat, bread, and most milk products, many of them drink a glass of watered oil every day, but it's unlikely that such a high calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it the first way of life that keeps people young?
She's still relatively young in 97 years of age for these latitudes.
Mirzaev, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a bunch of oil that'sn't getting tired of going there or anywhere.
There are eight people under one roof, including one of Mirzaev's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two babies will also be pumped nearby.
In the kitchen, guests make tea that is served in typical puztic glasses of the Armudu.
Mirzaev has perfect red and strong white teeth, under her head dress she hides the long dark-line cats that her son is proud to reveal to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I never used the shampoo," said Mirzaev.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a store in my whole life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after World War II.
But it's better when Gydar Aliyev's "love father" got up at the wheel.
Advocacy doesn't often sound like an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the nation ' s father, who rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan hardly knows the borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took over his reign.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (approximately the same amount as the euro) Mirzaev receives monthly pension for local conditions, which is the amount that can be lived well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-standing son is also right: "The writers in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happiness.
No reason to live as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show a deep division of the country.
The future Constitution, based on the Shariah, had met with a fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president didn't buy a paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but especially to Christian cops, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
For all of them, still hopelessly dispersed in the dislodged opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state in Neil on the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi, having almost apologized, said that he had temporarily reduced the competence of the Constitutional Court and had expanded his competence to "save the revolution."
But what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. from the American University of South California is not clear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be dragged in a night 15-hour leap with obstacles to Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, which is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that judicial proceedings are based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and continues to be the case of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use vague language and the legal luft resulting therefrom for a more strict interpretation of the Shariah.
At least one new article points to this: in all cases relating to the Shariah, the University of Al-Achar, the country ' s most important Islamist institution with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy are supervising the law, which would result in a de facto restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians must be preserved by the military court.
These courts, during the Mubaraka period, were used to suppress opponents.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
As stated in the draft, the State should protect the "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its moral and values."
It is legally not clear that public institutions, through this article, can control even the content of films and literature.
Open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article specifically establishes equality between men and women.
Yet another forbids the insults and insults of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it must be punished remains unclear.
It was also doubtful whether the phrase "abortion of people" was prohibited.
Will there be enough cartoons for the president or jokes about a right-wing man?
The question of interpretation, like much in this draft, which Murcy proposes to sign and which he says will be "very soon" submitted to the Egyptians in a referendum.
"The Revolution is back."
For weeks now, opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been emerging.
Tens of thousands of people gathered together in an unusual consensus on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The Revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution was "in the history dump."
Through the Twitter news service, he accused Murcy's followers of wanting to lead the road against democracy.
"If he announces a referendum, we'll go to his palace and throw it off," said oppositionr Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood is not yet recovered," quoted Egyptian media as the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution."
A well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a contrary demonstration, but from the precautionary point of view, not in Tahrir Square, but after a massive prayer on the other bank, Neil before Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the coverings and supporters of Salafites who were shouting: "The nation demands the application of God's law."
They demanded from Murcy, "Purify the land," and assured them, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it all began has provoked a state of virtually civil war.
Murcy's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
Muslim Brothers stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
It is now time for the people to decide at the ballot box where the country should go.
Most of the Islamists' project is considered to have been settled.
"The concept of "human rights" is not mentioned once."
Hafiz Abu Sa ' ed was furious of this violent constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EDO) defended Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or brought before the court.
Not because he shared their vision, but because human rights were indivisible to him.
For that, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, he regrets the conversation with "Welt am Sonntag."
The increased influence of Murcy on all three branches of government in the State disappoints counsel.
These measures are clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"In addition to strengthening the civilian State, the President de facto cancelled it," Saeda regrets.
Indeed, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of directions on Neil, with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be paid off.
The demontret in Tahrir Square warns: "You create a monster you can't control."
Norwegian cancer: The worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million Norwegians have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with local addiction to one extremely malignant fish dish?
Take a few sneakers of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna get a bad smell of a racket, one of the most famous Norwegian delikates.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air there's an inexhaustible characteristic smell.
Racfic is a trout with salt and wandering in the water until a year, depending on what kind of girl needs to be achieved.
As the limps move and cold, the Norwegian crowd gathers at the Fagernes festival dedicated to it, let's just say, the exciting dish.
"She eats cheese and drinks aquawit's backpack, a local tumour vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession, and co-located with the "rapportian general," who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink it with a lot of drinks.
"Someone likes aquat better than a racket," said Howard.
This drink is capable of smashing the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not so bad, it's not much different from the drying that you've spent a long time on the bus.
Racfic is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty when, before the appearance of refrigerators, the fish was washed in hermetically closed glasses with salt water in the fall.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had already been well and thoroughly abandoned, it was removed and, when the perception of alcohol was stunned, consumed in food.
Also in the memory of the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent are immigrants who bring jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (the long-standing rival, and not so long ago, and a much more surviving neighbour) come to work here massly.
Racfic is perceived to be an important symbol, irrevocably, although a few evil elements of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local meals.
On the other hand, it's all expensive, a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you £9 (14 United States dollars).
Norway rarely appears on the world news, and most of the people in the country seem to be comfortable with it.
People are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Bravik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist act is called the 22th of July.
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and murders.
Norway ' s current well-being is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventies) of one of the world ' s largest oil and gas industries.
"Only oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, a mixed trays with a long, bright hair, and amazing blue eyes, an epiphany of narcissistic well-being.
We are such a people as you call it to be a judgmental one.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We don't like to show up, we're not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the oil and gas industry ' s revenues are invested in a special fund created for future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone had stolen the money they had not, Norway had carefully calculated all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and walk in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a racket," she adds with a careless laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food, I'm done with the racketeering.
That hamburger with salmon meat is definitely exotic, delicious, delicious meat.
But tonight, there's still more fish waiting for us, with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel has a special dinner devoted to rackhisk, during which visitors decide on the best or perhaps the most scenty fish.
There's a live telegrapher showing the player in a tie-bomb surrounded by plates with a cocktail.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what assessment did you make for the best fish in your mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe by overreacting the aquawit.
Or maybe just hoping for the smell of this fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is facing a difficult beginning of career.
As long as the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, BBC Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country ' s population.
The road traffic in Mexico City is in particularly poor condition.
This city has been overburdened by transport and at a better time, and since Monday steel fences have been erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential coup and take over the country ' s rule.
It has a difficult task.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance in the administration of Felipe Calderón, which was now developing its powers, but the country had fallen into a drug war that had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to combat violence," reported earlier this week to Mr. Peña Nieto, President Baraku Obama of the United States, in the White House's sheep's office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto ' s political career with the President of the United States developed as governor of his hometown of Mexico City.
In his home country, in a densely populated and large state around the capital, views of the new governor were divided.
Hidden Man
In the Idilla city of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
The residents have given him credit for the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the establishment of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which is very different from the roads with the beans and the pits that were previously in this place, can be reached.
Tables with his name hang on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We relate to him hopes for real and serious change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Oliver Hernández, a state congressman from the Pana Nieto Institutional Revolution Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous detention, the PRI party was displaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year-old absence from the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party holds great hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also refutes the allegations of inactivity brought to the new President by the opposition.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
It's an excellent public figure, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkootl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is the most striking contrast with the motel streets of Valle de Bravo.
It is hidden under highways, and in many ways it is the suburban of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also harsh in the megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were engaged to deter drug traffickers in those areas; violence against women is particularly acute here.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a large landfill in the past two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico City during Mr. Peña Nieto ' s governorship, a figure significantly higher than that in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, the name of which has been penalized when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, he could at best be said that during his tenure as Governor, he had failed to deal with the issue of the killing of women.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of ignoring the problem completely.
A student of the concrete house, like most of the houses in this enchanted area, Irina Boundia, has difficulty keeping tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believed that her partner had killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed like her body was washed in front of it," she recalls Ms. Boundia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body had already broken.
Mariana's mother is rehearsing this story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall where he hangs next to the crucifix on which only one word is written: justice.
That was what they said the family had been denied.
"The state's gentlemen treated me like an old gossiper, an unconscioned peace breaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But that's not right, so it can't, especially when there's so many irregularities and miscalculations around here," she says.
After hoping for a presidential transition on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make the problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Oliver, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nes fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, charges him.
Prosecutors are attempting to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning ' s detention conditions were cruel.
The U.S. Army has been accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not avail himself of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he claimed had been carried over while in military prison.
During the cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort Meida, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the weekly visits to Manning by the prison administration during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination in the context of the defence ' s application for the termination of Manning ' s case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was conducted the day after Manning stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed following the visits of the Administration to Manning during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he assessed the treatment of himself by the prison administration as "best" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports examined do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning ' s direct request for conditions of detention, Fein claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about those problems and that the officials who visited him had discussed those problems and had stated that they would do so but had not recorded it in writing.
"They recorded "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise the subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denis Linde, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission dealing with the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he was removed from the regime of injury prevention and reduced conditions of detention.
Members of the military leadership explained that the limited regime of detention - lower than the regime of surveillance to prevent suicide - had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm all right to cancel the injury prevention regime... that my standard of life would improve, in my opinion," Manning explained.
On Thursday Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to prison at the military base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that his thoughts about suicide had appeared in Kuwait, and that he had once lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that it's psychologically hard to know how your fate works, and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has complained to Camp-Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning reportedly spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - completely alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave mattresses, blankets, slappers, a few clothes and glasses.
He says he tried to move, because he was sleeping or even just lying in daylight forbids the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep in his eyes, he was constantly struck by a light coming outside the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face when he was in bed at night, he said he was woke up and forced to turn his back.
Manning ' s lawyer filed an official objection to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he had been forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners at morning inspection.
Manning said he couldn't cover the blanket during the check.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the guard's order that he should leave a blanket that could be covered, but admitted that no one had expressly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday Manning stated that he was forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a pants or slappers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, the scalps and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and would significantly reduce the length of his sentence if Manning was found guilty by a military court, which was due to commence proceedings early next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to invite Manning to plead guilty for less serious crimes and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon alleges that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with the maximum regime.
The charges against Manning include aiding an enemy, illegal promotion of Internet data, transmission of national defence information and abduction of State property or documents.
If he is convicted of all counts of indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My national self-determination crisis is a story of Mexican American origin.
In the author ' s view, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because they were unable to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin break between two cultures.
During a recent visit to Mexico City, I went down the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control area and locked up on the ground.
The signs indicated two turns: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York think they're Italians.
Later, I looked at the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The issues of immigration, drugs and trade were on the agenda of the Presidents of those countries.
President Peña Nieto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success, instead of going to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and long-standing issue.
Most Americans never thought that the United States had invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But Mexicans are thinking for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of all those events.
Therefore, it is only for a US public official to say a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society that complaints are being lodged that Americans are violating the sovereignty of neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are filled with militaryism.
Mexico ' s relations with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States are the most complex.
Do you want to talk about the offenses?
They're enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are only for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone, father or grandfather, was unable to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type - scorched, poorly educated, poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we're aware of it.
Mexico doesn't see it that way.
Today's life is an expression of American dreams, we went to good schools, and we got a good job, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country we consider to be.
United States of America.
We also know that most Mexican elites and ruling class don't like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people as non-existent Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties to Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain now, finding a normal life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans of Mexican origin are hurt.
She's a U.S. citizen, and she thinks she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
By getting the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship was already not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much offense in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the recent treatment of their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is a lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed has led to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It sounds like a common, meaningless debate about who started it; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, have been killed; for the first time in the conflict that rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians were hopelessly linked to their eternal conflict, the Middle East has seen changes.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many realities in the rebellion, and Palestinians with Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that struck the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons that hope to break out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation is not encouraging.
Even if the ceasefire signed on 21 November is implemented, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of the militia on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement that came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will declare that they forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some faction leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people have been blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well conclude that time is working for them.
As Islamist movements in the Arab world grow, Hamas has new powerful and rich friends.
Turkey ' s renewed regional leader, who once was Israel ' s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic developing States in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas ' s loyal supporters claim the establishment of an Islamist peninsula around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, in which Hezbollah ' s paramilitary group reigns, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad ' s authority, and further to Jordan, where the king ' s authorities threaten Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened under President Mohamed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 30 years and had been overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas support.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, were an organization much similar to Hamas, and their leaders were more likely to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice could not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the rigid line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel ' s Israel ' s oil dome system has met the cost of its establishment and has successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained steadfast; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly through a wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, as part of the preparations for the 22 January elections, joined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of helping the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they hand over all power in the West Bank, will they not launch rockets from there towards Israel, as they are being assembled in the Gaza Strip?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to lift their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the rigid line would win; however, their calculations could be refuted by the Arab spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries have not the deepest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic problems.
The defence portion of Israel's budget is more than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to the least, take into account the long-term impact of its policies.
As democratic changes in the Arab countries unfold, the denial of the right to self-determination by Palestinians is a time bomb that will explode in the territories occupied by Israel sooner or later, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates those problems.
The bloody operations that have been carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have had to pay the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
The only solution that remains to be consistently called upon by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israel ' s concessions to the territories in exchange for security.
It is hoped that the ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively in the short term.
Egypt, which has long had to decide to stop the flow of arms to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has more than ever had a favourable position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967 in view of the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also work to reconcile Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more to create a Palestinian State than the upcoming United Nations vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama also has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he had never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continues to demonstrate his reluctance to engage in a solution to the problem.
It's a catastrophic, short-sighted attitude.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has entered into force a law on uniform package for cigarettes.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of disease-affected parts of the body are contrasted with the dark green boxes that are the same for all cigarettes.
Australia ' s first law on the same type of package of cigarettes and tobacco came into force in world practice, replacing logos and colouring of different brands with an identical box of dull olives, with creepy images of sick parts of the body and images of children whose health has been compromised by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the different images and signs that prevent smoking harm, the only difference between the packs that are mandatory on this Saturday is the name of the stamps, which are printed in the same small prints.
These are the world ' s most severe conditions for packing tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure is to deter young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on research that showed that people who had not started smoking before the age of 26 had never become smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
"It is clear that even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to deliver by packing," explains the Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies showing, for example, that the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of a princess.
Australia was one of the least-smoker countries in the world, so those changes would not have a particular impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were already considering such measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry were strongly opposed to the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences different from those that were conceived by its initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Producers from China and Indonesia will supply much more such products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha, a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that demand for porters and silicon bulwarks, hiding unpleasant pictures on the package, has grown rapidly (practicically from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their case in the Australian High Court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already delivered some 6,000 products to wholesalers and is awaiting a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the population targeted.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal television advertising and support for cigarettes, as well as prohibiting sellers from placing cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has been transferred to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites from posting advertisements online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you sell tobacco products and you only have this little loophole, the idea of moving your product on the Internet will seem extremely tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, followed by public health issues at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trade mark reviews written by alleged ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the hands of a private citizen who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't regret his strength and time and made a video, or is that why the advertising company is behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that industry is now more engaged in adapting to new regulations than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge new rules: these States claim within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of smoke-related photographs.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of smokers in Australia have demonstrated that they do not obey innovation.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just picking up a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, buying cigarettes with a picture of the mouth cavity tumor on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yoo, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that the same package made it more difficult to place goods on the shelf.
"I've had an hour off my new batch before, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and ban cigarettes altogether, and then we'd say, "What to do, okay, it's over, shut down the store," he says, putting your hands up.
It's not so bad to miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical troubles and replaced him with another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and it won't help much books, magazines, iPhone, or even duty-free shops.
However, a growing number of scientists and professionals in child development have recently advocated boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and our children, it's not too bad to miss.
This leads the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all standing in front of some kind of screen, the benefits of boredom go past us.
Maybe we should try to get bored.
Yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to this.
I used to think, like many, that boredom was an invention of a relatively recent time when people had more free time.
This is not the case, Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of the book "The Inviolable History of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011."
"In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls in Pompei, Latin boring inscriptions dated from the first century were found.
The question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, says that the understanding and vision of boredom have often changed.
After examining the research materials on the subject and asking the target group of 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "think but cannot do what would please them."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a missing person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything in apathy.
The main thing in the troubled boredom, he says, is "disturbing attention and the resulting deterioration of the mood and the sense that time is slow."
By describing the boredom, it might seem very depressing.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these states, the missing people see the causes of problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people in depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study "Unacceptible Mind: Defining boredom in terms of attention," published in September's journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment that was heard by participants in the recording of the voice reading magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of a non-business television program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds on low volume, so they could hardly be taken out, and the third group only listened to the voice recording without an outside sound track.
Those who heard a low volume TV said that they were bored, more often than others, were difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for that and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption of attention can cause a bore of boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at Gwelf University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninterested, "for example, by looking into the stream of goods on the market in the search for marriage, the distraction of music can help avoid boredom."
He's believed to continue that when people start showing up on a chair or drawing carcules on a paper sheet, they do it from boredom, but now we know that such actions are actually just helping not to relax physically.
"The investigation has shown that children who do not prohibit jerking and jerking learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly" states Professor Fencek.
At some point, we're all bored: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, looking at an interesting film.
However, different people show different degrees of boring inclination.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special "skinning scale" to measure these individual characteristics.
Questions and allegations are used to determine the scale of assessment, such as "A lot of what I have to do, alone and monotonically," or "I'm too much interested, so there's no time available."
Through such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys miss more girls than girls - Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Western Florida - especially when there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, adolescents are often missed at all.
In 1991, Reid Larson, a professor of personal and social development at Illinois University, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with the help of a pager.
It obtained the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents reported that they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent reported that they were bored outside school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he doesn't have any data on what such boredom data would have been, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "at the age of adolescents there is a peak of boring tendencies," mainly because children and adolescents are unable to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes it is not because, in extreme manifestations, research shows that it can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of the boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers were thinking about the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who had spent more than two decades studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; that's boring," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this brain doesn't always know what to do.
If you're bored and you put that energy on the guitar game or cooking experience, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only be better for a while, and soon it'll pass.
So if your child misses and gives him iPad, he'll stop bored, but he won't learn how to fight the boring alone or in any other way to manage his time and employment, Professor Fencek says.
"And such self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations," he claims.
Your child learns not only to take over himself, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think that boredom needs to be so proud.
But it doesn't have to be considered bad either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see it so much that we need to be bored more often, but boredom is a very unpleasant, inexorable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from constant care and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to constant overreacting, " he says, "and when there's silence, we lose and don't know what to do."
The new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado has not yet been implemented.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and a college student in the south-east of Colorado state, accused of committing a criminal offence that would soon be completely legal throughout the state: possession of a small piece of marijuana and a pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September he and his friends had been in Lamara and driving in a precinct near the border with Kansas when the police stopped them.
After a police officer found himself in a marijuana car, Mr. Orosco came to court for possession of drugs and drug use equipment - minor offences, each of which was subject to a fine of $100 - and the date of the trial was set.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has lasted weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small court cases depend not only on the law but on the place of examination.
The charges of petty marijuana offences are already in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken the same measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal once the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors decided to deal with the existing cases of marijuana and continue to be held accountable for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, votes in favour of preventing the emergence of new shops licensed by the State for the sale of marijuana.
"All of this is going so fast that I don't even know what to do next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Control officials in Washington State are also puzzled by their heads.
They will have to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which need to be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more structured market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Council for the Regulation of Alcohol Production and Marketing in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith than make any proposals and hopes that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we could target," he says.
The Washington State Bill, referred to as I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will bring the state into uncertainty for a year when the State licensing system is not yet in place and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to strike a balance between the state's "appropriate access" order to licensed marijuana, with a ban on selling it 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be extremely difficult to place licensed cannabis-trading plants in the urban line, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explained by Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently established research group "Marijuana Legal Centre."
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Outs of Aurora sent an e-mail message to his subordinate that the city ' s prosecutor ' s office would no longer hold persons aged 21 to be held responsible for possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police had ceased to locate people in the violations "from now on."
The Chief of Police, Outs, reported that the police would monitor the city ' s compliance with the regulations governing the medical production of marijuana and would prosecute illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The Uld District Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to be held responsible for the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
Currently, 119 persons have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution to prosecute acts deemed criminal at the time of their commission," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the village district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer hold adults accountable for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pet Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges in open cases involving the possession of marijuana.
"I believe that it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the population of Colorado who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of the residents in different locations in the state revealed the mixed attitude of the local authorities to the experiment of the state with marijuana.
"The District Prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard," explains Sean MacAllister, a Danish lawyer representing the interests of the convicted persons for the possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Laws on marijuana.
"They've been stalking people for so long, that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which a small number of marijuanas are treated in the same way as alcohol is intended to be a pilot field across the country to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalists and state officials are planning to expand the area of legalized trade, but they are awaiting instructions from the federal authorities from Opa, which are still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will give up on this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana on medical grounds, the federal Government has in most cases been good at the medical trade in marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of the Bureau for Drug Control are unlikely to enter homes to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the state-controlled rehearsal marijuana stores, which are permitted under the new law, consider Kevin A. Sabeth, a former counter-narcotics adviser to the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not await the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores that could not have opened sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrouse, a town in the western state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we're gonna give someone a license, and then it's gonna cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I remember myself, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, the modern analogue of the antiquity symposium, which lays the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, in the history faculty of the Wooster College of Oxford University at the end of the '80s, I collected my suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand and cry.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson was joking about me leaving because I had to drink from the crippled cups.
It wasn't really funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or that I went to private school.
For one reason only, and in this famous education cradle, it looked like a real barbarism and a blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was famous counselor Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a conservative.
You'll ask why you're thinking about it now?
According to recent data, a new generation of students with a right-wing centreist view is being subjected to the same grass.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the College College Club of the Christy Corps in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, attacked and made to feel undesired" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by the recent documentary on BBC 2 on student politics, "Star of wonders: Young, Smart and Right," in which conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown by Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who travels in Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver prick.
In other universities, Conservative students complain that of these students, they are "discharged because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in the university environment, there is a growing bias towards left views.
People who don't even know us think we're drunk and with impunity by rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Christy College of History who applied for enhanced protection, calls such an atmosphere "unbelievable" and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says that the attitudes of members of the student club towards the holders of the right-wing views have deteriorated considerably.
"This constitutes a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a robot and a shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford's fevered out of hatred for a conservative party.
One year earlier, the former student, Margaret Thatcher, was deprived of her honour by voting because of a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even for the steelists.
In the first days of the first week of a freshman's week, when students meet each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time what I was waiting for.
I didn't know the teachers weren't only looking through their fingers at the grassing of Conservative students, but they were also happy to be involved.
Political issues - the strike of miners, privatization and the Government ' s opposition to the imposition of sanctions against the apartheid Government in South Africa - have infiltrated the wooden panels of the auditor ' s wall.
At my first seminar, I needed to translate the French text of the 18th century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please transfer the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I'm in the back.
Harry Pitt was a very gigantic man with a face like cake.
"The Turks don't teach French in principle, or do they just lack the brain?" he asked.
Other students sniffed.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some initial lessons from French in your free time, if you are not very busy turning into society," Pitt did.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I sat alone at lunch; then someone slapped me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-grade student from the Faculty of English, who appeared as a member of the Association of University Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so you're gonna be more complicated.
Most Conservatives pretend they're Labourers."
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hypocrite myself.
I insisted that I didn't agree with anything Margaret Thatcher said.
That wasn't a good thing.
The first student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied in Ethan himself, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students grabbed his words.
I was messed up, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like I must have felt like homosexuals until the end of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the condescendants just under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a leiborist and hide my true beliefs?
The three years that I have come to look like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, was the only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her matches.
He didn't show up at college.
He despised him for provinciality, pettyness and commitment to a Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorial position at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started going to Oxford from a parent's home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unpreliminary friends of the capital.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the '40s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world, " he said complained.
- They can't do that, but not in the city of dredging whiskers...
Even my communists' friends have always behaved impeccable."
His wet eyes are confused.
"Don't take any quick decisions.
I'm sure it's just jokes.
You'll break my heart if you leave university."
I was sick of a permanent trip to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, as well as the conservative, did not withstand pressure and gave up his beliefs.
Next week, during a seminar, when another professor of history called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower, with shame, I admitted that I was brainwashed by my parents, and I called them "old fools."
The advance wasn't long.
The last nail to the roof of my career coffin in Oxford was meant to hit my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later, my stalkers surrendered.
When they left, I collected the suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a coat and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
The more sad that it was Oxford, who not only released 14 Prime Ministers tori, but is still hiding behind the unworthy reputation of a university in which equality and freedom of thought are valued.
"Valentino prefers elegance of glory."
The Valentino exhibit, the master of the sewing, which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nathi Abascal, Fiona Tissenn-Bornemica and other known Italian designer clients
Somerset House, the former British Queen Elizabeth I residence, the only place in the British capital to receive the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The director admitted it during the opening of Valentino: Master of Shit, a triumphal retrospect exhibit that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his repeated Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, whose only character is "or Signor" Garavani, but it could not be written without his client name.
Valentino always felt fascinated by a rare and distant world of nobles.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, personal letters and photographs are beaten under the signature of the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social recovery, from the humble tailor from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the home of the international elita.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with it.
"They don't even know how to smoke their cigarettes about your great carpet, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unbelievable host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come on his helmet in Gstada," explains the former wife, "Hani" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten handsome girls like Marella Anelli or Eugene Niarjos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model of Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in Spain's Square in Rome, years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - every detail of his apartment, her cleaning, her food, his music.
"Every of Valentino's guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began working with the modeler in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion, because his designs are real art works," she ends.
The parade of the rodos
Garavani's life isn't about obsessions, it's about love with total reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleys was turned into a glamorous subjugation of 60 metres in length, which offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of models and has to defilm in the pod, sucking "spectators" from the gras that are converging the masterpieces of Valentino, such as a dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that used Monica Vitti to "Nochi," or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Emperatrice of Fara Dib.
In this public, the names of Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn und Taxis, Mete-Mart of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg are blicked from the models.
Nathi Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't forget."
I remember him perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests, and jackets from the autumn winter collection 1971-1972.
"This was the gift he gave me," said Nathi Abascal, one of the designer's museum.
"I prefer him to the others for his marriage, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light in them, and they come to his face.
Propositions are perfect.
The princess and lawmakers of Patrizia's fashion shared the Jovampaola d'Arenberg, too, can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally arrived that hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it for the party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with fences, a scotch in a warehouse and a cut without a bralex.
"It was a dream that appeared," said the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is an extraordinary one," explains this Italian aristocrat, which lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps his holiday dress from a modeler with "maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories accompanying him."
"The King" of fashion
The great end of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Shantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler of her stitches) to make this dress out of a silk-coloured elephant bone with pearls, twelve kinds of different mugs and a four-and-a-half-metre plume.
According to journalist Suzy Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a high fashion wave of the late 20th century, "returning customers from the higher world."
The elite's "life style" that has been founded for many years, Valentino is now her best representative.
The Grand Cross Commander (the most prominent rank in Italy), the Labour Commander, the Commander of the Order of Art and Dictionary, awarded by the Order of Honour Legion, Garavani gathered as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"When my attention was drawn to his subtleness, his calm, his careful and impeccable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, I saw him a month ago at a solemn dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was insane, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest job in the world: Miners from Kawah Ijeen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur onto the top of the volcano along the steep rocky trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijay, one of the 400 miners who earn a living of sulphur mining in the Kawah Idzhen volcano, located in the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphury gas rising from the Earth's depths freezes in contact with the air.
The punctures of huge pieces of sulphur, which can weigh up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rings baskets on his shoulders and carries them upstairs on a broken rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, with a height of 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the crucified cargoers need more than 40 minutes to get up with a skull-shaped step, with difficulty in maintaining balance and purifying the road to avoid falling back and falling off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who broke off from the Kawah-Ijeen rock a few years ago.
Shahters from Kawah-Ijena earn 5 Eurocent for each kilogram of sulphur that is produced
As they go upstairs, they lay a road between tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and tired of heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the weights that the mining company put up a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
This is PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, rather than say, its employees, who are paying Rs. 662 (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petrochemical production, as this mineral is distributed in daily life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even for the removal of sugar.
"So as the norm is the transfer of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (Euro3.8) for every walk," explains to us Anto, who usually carries out three daily transports.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to save Rs. 138,000 (Euro1.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a mess for such a human effort, it's three more than he'd earn in the field.
"Paids to miners are very high in local measures, where the coffee collection pays Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and average monthly earnings equal to Rs. 2 million (Euro167) " explains the cargoer who used to work as a casher on the tourism island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (Euro6.2) per day and the station was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a valid reason, which in Indonesia is as destructive as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus are, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto asthma, he's breathing hard, coughing all the time, and his eyes are tearing off because of toxic gases.
During his 27 years, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawah Ijeen, whose earrings had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, coughing all the time, and he's getting his eyes off because of the toxic gases that make up the volcano.
It's the price he's supposed to pay for his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
A punishable life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or porter in a hotel, but instead he does a mule job.
The act of a dirty wooden hut with other porters, it rises every day at 2:00 a.m., because sera does not stop leaking at night when its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and shines in darkness.
As the shadows call, Anto goes down to the crater, covering his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 porters take baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulphur to save costs and has not provided any equipment to porters who work for their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of the 30,000 rupees (Euro2.5) of the photo survey fee, which, along with a $15,000 ticket (Euro1.2), the guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
"It's a work for cattle, not for people," says Badrosin, a brown porter for 42 years, who has spent three decades in Kawah Ijena since he left college.
A man able to raise up to 110 kilos, he assures me that he's gonna tolerate "as long as he can" because he needs money to educate his three children between 18 and 10 years of age.
I'm not retiring, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sera burns its throat and burns its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense smoke poles coming out of the volcano, they are so worn out that no one complains of their serious diseases... more serious than their usual breathing problems, artroses, knee pains and ulcer on their shoulders, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unninik can only now raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades bring 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, reaching a distance of 18 kilometres across a narrow path among the trees.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here, 'cause the volcano is my whole life," says Wyninik, wide opening a mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, he also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates one of the world ' s most difficult occupations from generation to generation: what people do with Kawah Ijeen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singapore is accused of career, stress and housing and education prices in the absence of children.
"The settlement of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, you're gonna do our civic duty and make life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of the promotion of mint pawns, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local words like "Let's put the bao (boil) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, is hopeful that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to this issue in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to make people do what they owe.
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves like this, so we felt that it was a topic that we should address.
We knew that the Government was trying to do a lot of things, such as launching pheromones or organizing quick dating parties (clicks dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily working.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, which is to write rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not perceive it so lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends US$ 1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children born.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech urban State in South-East Asia, also known as the conservativeness of its leadership and its strict public control.
Singapore ' s fertility rate, according to its national population office, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was less than 2 - known as the percentage of replacement - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Marriage and Family Policy Office of the National Population Office, says that the reason for this "improved education" and "wideer career opportunities" is the reason.
"This allowed people to have a wider gamma of options with regard to life's goals and priorities other than marriage and family creation," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
However, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration to counter population decline, is a source of outrage among the local population.
Singapore has websites where xenophobia is barely hidden against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and refusing to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for the fact that last year Singapore's ruling party achieved the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem by means of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unforeseen implications
While the decline in fertility has a well-known impact on the nation ' s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditures and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, it has begun to influence the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved to control the number of small apartments known as the "future box" that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These quarters of 46 square metres are very well sold.
However, there is a view that they can contribute to a single lifestyle and deprive developers of the incentives they want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, the CEO of the EL Developers building firm, says that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than more simple copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that such apartments are being bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidance to developers who had previously been challenged if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
It's too tense.
Singapore is a state city.
Although these new regulations may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singapore workers in the financial quarter of the centre, they do not seem to have a particular effect.
"People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and so many people delay it," says a young governmentman.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing and education prices as causes that prevent them from starting children.
So, no matter how much the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children born, with regard to childbirth, the last word remains for Singapore.
Personal in offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a private or "lifeline that has the right to defend against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers that he faces when discussing on the Internet situations that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five guys from 10 to 15 years of age, who were often network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," personal, and "a password and a user's name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't put in the post," says ten-year Jorge, when trying to explain personal values on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messinger, where he's had records for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mom might know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On the FB, I download beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also having fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine or someone who's being stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish false photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures me that he knows 35 friends in his FB and nine of his fans on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I'm responding, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks - entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he points out.
Without wondering, she says that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't count with someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The 14-year-old José case is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter acknowledges that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they push me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my record," he admits.
José became the follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experience of what is known today as cyber-bobing is no stranger.
One friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted.
"He never found out who it was," he assures me.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the record.
"Just turned on confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set the record in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would load photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusive situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like it or if I wanted it.
"I want to know it's a cyberbobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marialos Porras, an English teacher and an expert in education and education, believes that it is necessary to understand that social media are intended to inform children and adolescents.
"The Internet has emerged as a tool for searching for information, but with the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras indicates that Mark Prenski, a teacher at Yale University and a worker from the Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are them, children and young people who were born in an age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning ourselves," she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken at the age when maturity is insufficient for this."
"Even so that they are selective, while the most important thing is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like to publish a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign pictures from the party, do you ask for permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, do everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they should behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"On the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and must also be on social media," she claims.
Activity
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and a consultant on education, explains the need for heads of families to read in good faith social media policies.
In understanding each of the paragraphs, they have good reasons to talk to children about the assumptions of opening the record on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "don't speak to strangers."
The UNASUR Summit ends without the Lima Declaration being made public
The VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was declared previously and theoretically signed by the seven parties.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President ' s Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be delivered after closure, but then confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
On the text questions, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Olyant Umala, during the press briefs.
Journalists ' access to information about the Summit has been limited at all times.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the Presidential Assembly without sounding, saying "closed meeting, sound is forbidden."
A little information that was circulating among reporters was transmitted by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments who attended the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which provoked dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President ' s administration sent an e-mail to the media from the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is a statement by Umala rather than an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and despite the insistence that the press had demanded it, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not distributed.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were provided with referral systems, but that information was limited to the maximum extent possible.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the Hague Court verdict, which resolves the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which began on Monday in The Hague, in the context of the indictment that Lima had filed against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
"Chile was, is, and will be, a country respectful of international law, peaceful settlement of differences, covenants and international tribunals," added Piñera, and welcomed the harvest of Umal's hand against the backdrop of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice occurred immediately after Colombia challenged the Bogotá Pact this week, according to which it recognized that the verdicts of that international court were subordinated to the decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it found wrong.
The Summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011, after the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Olint Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later than the afternoon of Lima's time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements he had adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would take "Your steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements."
He reported that action was being taken to improve "cooperation in combating insecurity and organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, affordable Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters."
Since Europe is in crisis, "the economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumph, but rather serve to broaden our production base and to anticipate a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We have decided to grant privileges to a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the connection between South America's spaces, especially in the village and border areas... bringing together our countries and shaping new economic schemes," the Peruvian President said in a message delivered.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were in Peru and were limited to cross-sectional axes in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at a greater link with Ecuador, but he had not provided more details.
The outcome document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as a re-accession to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace would be united and had a good relationship between neighbours was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court contested by Bogotá.
"After tomorrow on Saturday, maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Pact with Nicaragua, which will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"with President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can handle this as much as possible in a civilized and respectful manner," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have a new President, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also at the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the bloc met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Suriname, Venezuela and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter ' s participation has been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to Peru's State television that Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one homeland."
He defended, in this context, the South American Citizenship Project, which approves the countries parties to UNASUR.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back in the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also expressed his support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) as a prerequisite for reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and for taking into account those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is not clear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and funded by the United States," he stated, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanju.
Correa assured me that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but did respect his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in due course, "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not follow the process."
He also criticized Swedish justice for having to come to his territory for questioning about the alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation itself considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration in Assanja's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a little league problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What is really there is a risk of deterioration in his physical and mental health due to imprisonment in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing security of integrity that would enable him to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of stabbing the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he suggested that "if Britain gives security tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation and how it has already done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or asks him for Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not lose "the power, the integrity and the lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of freedom of the press are not spoiled evil politicians, but bad journalists supporting the living, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he was pleased that neither those journalists, "no bankers nor bourgeois hegemons were dominant in Ecuador," and added that, as re-elected, "the revolution would be deepened to continue in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for the coups under the rule of law" because in reality, "it has truly destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Furthermore, the President of Ecuador considered that the wish of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime boundaries between the two countries had been justified following the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had been in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision has not yet been implemented.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be treated together to overcome them and move forward.
He also looked forward to the good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it was right for Latin America to resort to international bodies if two countries committed themselves to making a decision, however difficult it may be."
With regard to the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he was considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it was sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost his election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
If won, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"That's the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Vice-President Nicholas Maduro of Venezuela, who told me that he was on his way to treatment, which had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chavez's health is worsening," he explained.
The Head of the Ecuadorian State participated in Lima today in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had yielded positive results.
"It's like I've been stunned," he recalls that hard, despite all the doctor's tactics, the moment.
A young man hid it from her family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was hit in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He's been living with a 22-year diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which in the early 1990s would be difficult to believe - too few treatment options existed, too little knowledge of illness, too prejudiced the sick.
So even the director of the Mexican Social Protection Institute clinic didn't want to say good-bye to him "because he had a cut."
In other words, at that time, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it's possible to survive the syndrome and do it without compromising the quality of life.
However, without knowledge of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "seated" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement so far is that the survival of the patient who begins to be treated in a timely manner and that the survival of the general population is exactly the same," pointed out the head of HIV in HCG, Haime Andrada Villanueva, citing that this information was confirmed in a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
The infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrada Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but life expectancy and quality depend on the extent to which the immune system available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis has been affected with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 are reported.
In short, the above means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "with control, can live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people had died in 2011, and 187 deaths had already been recorded by May of this year; however, it was claimed that there had been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatal outcomes?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it, it's what we do in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we've had no shortage of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, i.e. at the late stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating data: "nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunist infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on total mortality is to conduct an early diagnosis, and therefore there is a need to provide mass-scale detection samples for all people who are asked to do so."
The proposal brings together specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients like Fabrizio who applied for testing in a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that his friend did so and, despite his young age, he had already been at the AIDS stage and even suffered from the Kaposhi sarcoma, a cancer tumor that was one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"I'm gonna die anyway, I'm gonna beat up three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There's a positive change, I'm good at eating, doing exercises, taking drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to move his statement to those who are now in the context of World AIDS Day into fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so much better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person who is responsible.
His presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year in 2012.
Preservatives behind the counter.
The gap between health programmes and a simple citizen is attributed to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has addressed the HIV issue.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we have hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do they want you?" This is a popular question, with equidiscipline and condemnation, by social workers, school counsellors, pharmacies and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the promoter.
I propose that this inefficient distribution be changed; that condoms be not just behind bars and that hundreds of them be in public toilets in places often attended by young people.
It's not an encouragement of dispersal.
This is not about the payment of beer and motel, and Governor Emilio González responded when asked whether the distribution of condoms was possible in his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he pointed out.
Key data in Jalisco
There are 13.435 reported cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State ranked 4th in the national rating for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of the infections are in the sex route, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent in the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because for one registered case there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of strips and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the decision of 15 June by Judge Harlene Hale in the bankruptcy court of the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms vulnerable in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens doors to the glass manufacturer in Mexico to apply to the United States Supreme Court, providing evidence of three inconsistencies.
As an admission, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. bankruptcy code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceeding concerned the competition proceeding in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm ballot recognized in the critical mass of the competitive debt that Vitro subsidiaries had in front of the parent company, the majority needed to approve restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that the scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, of which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debt guaranteed the Federal Institute for competitive proceedings.
It is also true that by considering the votes of the affiliates, one way or another, the Vivtro creditors who fought against him in United States courts, namely the vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
These data are being omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that has been faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced in attacking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sad family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote can reach its plenary, i.e., five judges, because only three were voted.
In the event of failure, an application for certification will be submitted, which will require a review by the highest court, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
Worse among all, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae ("other court") describing the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Proceedings Act, indicating that it was exempt from the agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy law.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. rules established for cases of inter-State insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Caramball from two sides: they hit Vitro and beat the country.
Overall balance
In view of the complaints filed for several months by Mexicana de Aviación unions on the table against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union Association of Aircraft Pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
The station led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just submitted a criminal claim against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General concerning an operation performed by an entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be aimed at buying shares from the professional management company of hotels.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
They're surrounded by Dragon Mart.
Meeting on weekends at the Caribbean University forum, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of common civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to confront the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products in an isolated country, with a residential area near 150 companies.
In the past, Canacintra succeeded in bringing together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which have aligned some of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
The death of ACTA
With regard to the Government ' s rejection of the Senate ' s claim to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, this case has already been placed in the archives.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility of treating it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debt without affecting the short-term, the Homex housing builder is placing 500 million pesos in the market.

Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector Hector "Hetin" Reyes, a busy basketball traveler, has been connected to this sport for over 60 years and has, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before the brain haemorrhaging chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was loaded into sports for over 60 years, as a player in small categories, as a player in the upper basketball league, authorized and leader of the BSN with the Baymon Covbabes and President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as I was President of BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during his visit to his home in Baymon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all the pictures and commemorative items gathered for his long journey, testify to that.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his path through Kovboev from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he reached the age of 15 as a co-agent or agent of the contract.
"It was my best years that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Kovboev championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsi's debut at BSN.
From that moment on, he continued to lead the "Kuko" Ortiz, who was the great administrator, pointed out Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Would you like it?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended a sniper, Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombs.
I remember saying that if Mincy brought Baymon's championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Covboev Championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance because by 1988 I was already the head of the Federation.
By that time, I'd prefer to enjoy his achievements and those of Minsi at the National Assembly.
I remember the first time we won the United States during the Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the 1990 World Championship, where we got the fourth place, and it was supposed to be a bronze, if it weren't for the Canadian judge who forced us to play the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States team, which was quite like the one that won the bronze at the World Championship.
Not only did Minsi, Gaussa, Ramona Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculina' (Ortis) play the team again, but also the young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francesco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' Morales, who were unable to participate in 90 because of knee injuries.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players suspended for disorder at the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His figures on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that's not taking into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young woman, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendas, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmao, Armandido Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think's your biggest success in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of national assembly between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to realize, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island to national playoffs.
Now, guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the results of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch the music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Larry Hagman's actor died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Wert, Texas, became world-renowned because of his leading role as John Ross Yuing, better known as J.R., in the Dallas television series, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil predator, Jay Ar Yuing, in the Dallas television series, was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night due to cancer complications, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a studio in Dallas.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, playing again a sign role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, told her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, nice and talented, and I'm gonna miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995, he found a malignant tumor in the liver and suffered transplantation.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television because of the role of a decent type in a light comedy, "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive ginny girl played by Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the chief character of two comedies, who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the movies included the roles that were well accepted by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his master's interpretation of the delicious, disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to the top of the glory.
The drama series of the CBS channel on the Ying clan and other characters in its surroundings was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
A slogan called "Who shot J.R.?" designed to make noises around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character almost kills, breeds international discussions and millions of dollars at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show that time.
When a response was given in the episode of November 1980, an average of 41 million television viewers looked at him and turned Dallas into the second most entertaining program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, attracting 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine, who shot him in the execution of Mary Crosby.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Yuing as an insane corrupter with a charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and a wrong husband who wanted his husband to be an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed in treatment.
"I know what must be on the gravestone J.R." said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "This is where an honest citizen J.R. Ying is sitting."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Princesipal, also the hero of the original show, remembered on Friday of Hagman as someone "a big one, both on and off the screen."
He forgets and is indispensable for millions of readers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of Dallas were shown months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season was completed and the sixth was in production, reporting the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what's gonna happen with the show after Hagman left.
Fort Wert, Texas, he was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who blistened in classic works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage with Ben Hagman's lawyer.
He tried to be happy at New York's theatre scenes in the early 1950s and then served in England's Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axlsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything in there that would feel capable of hurting anyone or affecting them in any way," he said, "Princa Asociaada at that time.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients in fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to surgery and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starts a course that explores "The End of the Light."
Every week students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when a professor of religion, Stewart Sharma, decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had had an inexorable bait: the end of the "long back reference" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which had attracted many people as proof of the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea what expected him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "longamarmegeddon," and the growing conflict to which Israel would engage, a place where Christian theories of the end of time believed Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it was gonna be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If we were to analyse what was happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad things are good for those who have apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the last one in history.
At the University of Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Waker is reading the course "The Media, Culture and End of the World."
Every week students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions are proposed.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films for apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to examples of real life.
"I tried to tell the students that it might be true and impossible," said Walker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the Latin American professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, the Associate Professor of Art History and Anthropology, joined together to read a course called the End of the World.
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world doesn't come," said Restall.
Despite the "unintentional destruction," students must study, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken to the apocalypse canon, which leaves students no choice but to work until the very night the world is expected to end, says Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"Mesta ended in two hours," said Restall about his high-level high-level class, which was recorded by 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks before the semester started from people who asked if there were any other places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the department of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is only a question of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach it," he noticed.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - let alone the professor - said he believed in the day of the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project touched the Maya prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student at Temple University from West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he pointed out that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has several centuries of people responding to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Precisely in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question whether he knew about any course on the end of the world there.
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, referring to a superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
He noted that for a long time it had been said that many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people would start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophy, that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to the end of the world party.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Department of Communications.
