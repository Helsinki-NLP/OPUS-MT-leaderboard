China is strongly opposed to the adoption by the United States of the Taipei Bill.
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called Taipei Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council for Taiwan, Ma Xiaoguán.

China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by nothing or by any force, stressed by Ma Xiaoguán.
TikTok hides bad videos from users.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censors the video, which refers to Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence or the banned Falun Gong religious group, says The Guardian.
The documents before the publication state that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is promoting China ' s foreign policy objectives through an application.
Most of the violations related to China's policy fall under "inflammation of hatred."
In each case, TikTok puts inappropriate publications in a context appropriate to the general rules so that the social network does not appear to be censored.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of "criticism or attacks on any country's policies and social rules, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.."
The ban on referring to incidents in the Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia is "a search for the history of China or other countries."
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or government figures," including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sen and Kim Jong-yun, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, the Japanese Premier Sinzo Abe, the South Korean President Park Kyung-he, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Namendra Modi, as set out in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by social media administrators and may lead to user lock-up.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the website, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: "Now we are using a localized approach to modernize, as well as engaging independent local professionals."
Russian users TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, tells the co-founder of the "Producer Center" by Rustem Bogdanov.
The Producer Center is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the promotional materials of the Produser Center bloggers are in line with the social media, but user materials can be posted without agreement, handing over the Bogdans.
On the question of whether TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov responded positively and said that he had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agency: "The basic rules for the users of TikTok are listed in the user agreement: it is not possible to express shocking content that discriminates against speech and so on."
But under these rules, any content that doesn't like moderators can be subtracted by Zaripov.
Zaripov's Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
The social media administrators check their age by means of artificial intelligence: neurosteering individuals and determining how many years a man looks, tells the Bogdans.
If neuralism decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, it adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the WeWork Coorking.

In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters that replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Kommersantha with reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the controller gave communications operators information about more than 2,500 numbers that had been called from clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators discovered the replacement of the number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked and 59 were restricted to the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Sichev, explained that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted with the replacement number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank ' s warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation under the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a replacement number.
According to the Bilinea press service, some of the information on the fraudulent calls sent by the C.B. was incorrect: the numbers actually used by banks to communicate with clients were on the list.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the organization ' s work.
Artem Sychev told us that the Central Bank plans to create a fraud number base that will be addressed by the communications operator at every call to check the number.
He explained that the establishment of such a framework would require legislative amendments.

He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance was obliged to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards and wrote RT.
In Crimea, a green alternative was offered to NATO.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, instead of joining NATO, should engage in good-neighbourly relations with Russia.

Money is more important than football.
Barcelona blackmails Neymara.
The Spanish Barcelona and its former football player, the Brazilian Neimar, are trying to resolve the financial dispute that arose after the attacker's transition to the French Pari St. German.
The case was almost brought to trial, but the Catalons suggested that the player resolve the dispute without Femida's interference.
Otherwise, they refuse him to return.
Neemar and his clever father, who is also an agent of Brazilians, have pursued an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was expected to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the Forward was in the POW for a record of 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he got 22 million from the Catalons, and now he wants to take the remaining 18.
Not only does Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When the capital of Catalonia became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
"Sine-Granate" insists that the bonus was relied on to perform the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player relied on only a quarter of Euro40 million and requires the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in summer Nearmar and Barsa almost agreed to the return of the "bad" player in Catalonia.
True, the deal has broken, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
So, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player that if the issue of financial claims was not settled pre-trially, it would rule out the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neimar himself wants to come back so much that he asked for assurances that the Catalons would buy him back.

The football player Paul Mamaev, released last week from the parole colony, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The former semi-defendant of this club may shortly sign a contract with the FC "Rost," reports the Chempionate portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the Rostova and Mamaeva are now in the final stage.
A contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years with the possibility of extending for another season.
Sport-Express states that Paul Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination in Moscow's Dinamo day earlier, but the test was not carried out because of the "undefined situation in the club."
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement of the parties.
A half-defendant played for a redhead club since 2014.
With the team, he won the Russian championship's bronze twice.
Previously, Mamaev was in favour of Moscow's Torpedo and CSA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia's team, holding 15 matches.

A man with a samurai sword tried to resist a body found in a garbage pile.
The resident of the U.S. city of Okland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after he had slammed the samurai sword on his opponent of the dispute because of the cart found in the trash.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging into a bunch of garbage outside the empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers on the evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the spoils.
Miller saw Beavers' discovery and got upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because the first one started digging in the trash.
Men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with her towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and started stalking the opponent.
He chased Beavers around his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started swinging it in the direction of the cart kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller what was going on in the video.
Having noticed the camera, Miller ran away, but threatened to come back.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Shortly after that, he saw an unknown woman entering his yard and took the cart, shouting insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving a car without right.
The man was detained and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardystone, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and injured her with a sword.
He thus responded that the guests at the wedding that he was celebrating at the same hotel where he was staying did not let him smoke.
Mass disorder on three
The Moscow case against the summer protestors the more, the more marked it breaks down into separate fragments and loses political filling.
Evidence of the very fact of "mass disorder" is not subject to verification, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The failure of the case must inspire society, but it will certainly leave the forces with extreme irritation, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disturbance), Alexei Minayailo, was suddenly released from detention without any obligation, and a few hours later and was completely rehabilitated: the SRC withdrew his charges.
Minjilo has been arrested for almost two months and has been followed by several professional communities: historians, priests, lawmakers.
After that, only two accused of rioting (initially 13 accused) remained in the case: Sergei Fomin, who was transferred on 3 September to house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been arrested before the end of December (also accused of violence against a representative of authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author to a joking petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States
The Court of Vidzem Precinct of Riga punished the author of a joking petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States of America, Denis Barteck.
It is noted that the man has assigned 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
"Good sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented on the Barteck Court's decision.
He added that punishment was usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures of Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time, the petition on the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was instituted against Barteck under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, "Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia."
Prior to this, in 2016 the author of the Internet petition for Latvia ' s accession to Russia received six months of prison.

The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect police custody from the dissemination of slanderous and disrespectful information on the Internet.
A request for public discussion of the bill had been made on Friday at the Federal Legal Portal, and the draft instrument itself had not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in response to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from "dissemination in information and communications networks, including on the Internet, of an abusive nature, including discredited information."
What exactly is meant to protect the police against slander in the network is not specified.
The explanation of the document indicates, however, that the provisions of the amendments will be applied by the "individualization of the mechanism" already preceded by the law on the freezing of posts insulting the authorities and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, amendments to the Police Act are due to enter into force in January 2020.

The first violation of the prohibitions is punishable by a fine of between 30 and 300,000 roubles and, for a repeat offence, an administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media by blocking the Japanese edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Chudov District Court of the Novgorod region fined a local resident 30,000 roubles for posting "two recordings of information in a non-personal manner that insults human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect for society, the State, the authorities exercising State authority in the Russian Federation."

Will the phytoestrogens and the phytoandrogenics help to prolong youth?
The subject of the phytoandrogens has been poorly studied.
Of the most famous, pine dust.
But the phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain age-related diseases (in particular cardiovascular diseases, some cancers).
The known sources of phytoestrogenics are all beans (the most popular is soy), ham, and the seeds of the lion.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot fully replace natural hormones.
Possible harm from such additives could not be excluded.
For example, in the context of their reception, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that there are too many external analogues in the body.

Hydrometeorological Center called the faithful people's signs
In Russia, there are many people's signs that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometeorological Center, they checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists concluded that only two of them could truly be trusted, indeed, in a short-term time cut.
As the scientific leader of the Hydromet Center of Russia said, Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red during the entrance, the next day will indeed be weathered, just as our ancestors had noticed.
And if the heaven shines brightly, the next day there will be rain.
The second sign is based on bird observation.
It's more common to say that if they're flying low, it's usually raining.
Explains this simply - when the humidity of the air is great, the mosks have to wet their wings and the pernaths are forced to fall to hunt insects, and they write the TASS.
On different continents, there are their people's signs.

Unknown oil stains found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on the 99 beaches of north-east Brazil.
Pollution patterns have been scattered by 2,000 kilometres of the coastline.
The first oil stains discovered began to be reported on September 2nd.

In the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which had been sent to the analysis of the samples found, it stated that they did not correspond to the oil extracted from the fields in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely she was caught in the oceanic period," told the Brazilian news portal G1 by the coordinator of the Union of Petroleum Workers of the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states of the north-east of the country, environmental defenders found nine sea turtles fully covered by oil tape.
And only two of them managed to save.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute ' s specialists recommend that tourists and local residents cross the oil stains and alert all the contaminated sites found.

Russians have nothing to retire - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvienko, considers that Russians do not have sufficient savings to fully implement the bill on the guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings in the world is quite common.
The other thing is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"In my view, a large proportion of the population now has incomes, of which they have nothing to spend on the increase in pensions in the future," stated V. Matvienko.
Russia, in the view of the Speaker, is unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and payment of pensions, since "the constant changes in this area have completely confused them."
This does not mean that I am opposed to improving the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we have an obligation to do everything in order to ensure that pensions are improved, the social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible and responsive to national realities, stated V. Matvienko "RIA News."
The head of SF stressed that if the initiative (the law on the guaranteed pension product) were to evolve, several basic principles must be provided, including voluntarism, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility for the preservation of pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a bill on the guaranteed pension product (PPP) should be agreed upon.
Among its main elements is the exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens ' accession to the savings system, the safeguarding of long-term State pension savings, the registration of the citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Previously it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on income-sharing, leaving Marvel's guilty man behind.
Sony's right to a movie hero.

It was reported that at some point this situation had ceased to exist, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faiga said he loved it.
It's amazing that Spidi's trip to the rubber Marvel will continue.
"All of us in Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
The spider man is a sign figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," he says in his press release.
At the same time, Fagie recalled that Sony was also building his own knucklehead, built just around the spider man.
"He's the only superpowered hero in different movies.
So, while Sony continues to develop his own Spidy universe, the future can present unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played a spider man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his account at Instagram a piece of the movie "Wolf With Wall Street," in which hero Leonardo de Caprio yelled "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to get half of the cash from the spider-Man movies, provided that both companies paid half of the production costs.
But it wasn't Sony's.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from a knive Marvel has provoked anger from many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have cooperated well over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We're glad we can go forward together."

Pelosi Democrats, who hold the majority in the chamber, have previously announced the launching of impeachment proceedings against the President.
This happened after Trump had been complained to by an intelligence informant.

The expert told me why you should give up tea in the bags.
A group of scientists from Canada representing McGill University found that when making a bag of tea in a cup in five minutes, more than 10 billion pieces of microplastics are caught.
The packaged beverage may also add parts of the sawdust, told Nation News by the expert in Elizabeth Tihonov's food security.
According to agronomia, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
The sawmills don't drop out at the end of the season, so they might be in tea.
"Better than that, the packages don't always include tea plants," said Tihonov.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of tea for a diaper that was sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packaged tea was not only in composition but also in the method of production - micropities were heated to high temperatures, so that they could begin to release harmful substances.
"The best thing to buy is clean green or black tea, the least added in that drink," the expert pointed out.

The regions were invited to share the secrets of business support

It is time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy compiled information from regions on their business development programmes and the legalization of self-employed persons, as well as on the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters to the regions, the senators were briefed on the problems of SME development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
"To date, communication among regions is not sufficiently established, resulting in a lack of information on regional entrepreneurship programmes across the country being identified by the business community in all regions of the senators' visits," noted by Andrei Kutepa.
In an annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive regional efforts to legalize self-employment and consolidated regional data with proposals and issues (resumed).
In addition to line ministries, consolidated regional data are also sent to the heads of the regional executive branch.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could stimulate enterprise development in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Parliamentary Gazette of the Senator.
Useful Experience
Today, support programmes for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and successfully implemented in many regions of the country.
For example, the Centre for Entrepreneurship Support operates in the Volodo region, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.

In a number of other regions, special support measures for youth entrepreneurship are being implemented.
Self-employed continue to be removed from the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes in existing legislation should be made to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangelian region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "business" as "the most appropriate part of public services to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the province of Ivanov, amendments should be made to expand the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including the separation and renovation of residential buildings, cabin structures and physical training.
The Bryan region believes it is important to strengthen the control of poor dairy producers through the Mercure Veterinary System.
In the Kostrom and Magadian regions, they advocate that the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship be incorporated into the legal framework.

"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be elaborated in the form of specific bills," assured Andrei Kutepa.

So those who don't want to fly next to the babies because of the possible inconveniences associated with their crying can get as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use airline services were thrilled by the innovations.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the losers complained that he had been flying from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and that three crying children were sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of "times only for adults" by expressing his willingness to pay for such flights.

Paul Ustinov joined the picket in support of the figures of the "Moskov case"
Acter Paul Ustinov joined the series of single pickets "Free All" that take place on Friday at the Russian President's office in the Old Square in Moscow, transmitting the Interfax correspondent.
The picket series began on 18 September in support of Ustinov itself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the participants in the action are standing in the hands of a poster with the inscription "Free All" and the names of the convicted and arrested after the unagreed meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster the names of Egor Zhukov, Kirilla Zhukov, Danila Beglez, Eugenia Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotova, Ivan Podcopaev, Aydar Gubaydulina, Alexei Minjilo, Sergei Fomina, Samariddin Rajabova, Nikita Chirtsova, Eduardo Maleshevsky, Vladislav Sicia.

The supply of "sanctions" to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Russian Government, it was estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons during the same period in 2013, according to Interfax.
However, the cost of imported products has declined to $226.5 million, from $4 billion to $975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, imports from CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia have been offset by imports from CIS countries.
We recall that, at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia as part of the counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official legal information portal, it was noted that the rules were extended by one year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The destruction order was originally extended to products from the United States, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, as of 1 January 2016, Ukraine, joined the list.
Under Putin's decree on the destruction of the country's smuggled "sanctions" (food under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has permitted the destruction of "sanction" food by any legal means.
As the sanctions of the West continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.

Chile began to build a 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
As ESO reports, this week the construction of a dome of the E-ELT telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope - the European super-largest telescope) was officially started while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project was being undertaken.
Its total value is estimated to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 six-angle segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 metres in diameter, will help E-ELT get the first detailed pictures of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for the Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surrounding areas of Sgr A*, supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has just been built, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years since the first E-ELT construction plans were announced.
The main mirror contract, whose total value was about 400 million euros, was awarded by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
