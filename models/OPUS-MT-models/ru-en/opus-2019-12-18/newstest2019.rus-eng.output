The number of new recruits ready to be sent to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People ' s Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugana People ' s Republic of Moldova, Andrei Marochko, said that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, Kiev is planning to "think some way to complete the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Supreme Court, mass dismissals have led to a low level of staffing," said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians who had been recruited could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev started a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a combined force (EPP).
This measure was supposed to increase the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the assassination of the head of the NPD, Alexander Zacharchenko.
The authorities of the NPD described what had happened as a terrorist act.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion had been organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.

It is specified that the agreement should still be approved by the court.
On 28 September, it became clear that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders of making a statement that sufficient funds were available to buy shares of the company and had sued the entrepreneur.

The head of the British Ministry compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being captured by the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brixit negotiating process.
What happened to faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, noted Gazeta.ru.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the Irish border remains an open issue.

In August, Telegram changed the confidentiality policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and cell phone number of the suspected terrorist user when receiving the relevant judgement.
Telegram audition has been reduced by 1.2 million since the closure in the Russian Federation.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and founder Tesla Ilon Mask resolved their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, Masku will have to leave as head of the Tesla Board of Directors within the framework of the agreements reached.
In doing so, the Commission allowed Mask to retain the position of head of Tesla.
As noted, Tesla's founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.

In doing so, money is distributed among the affected investors.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued the CEO of Tesla Ilon Mask because of his report published in Twitter about the company's possible ransom.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the $420 stock was claimed to be "because of the importance of this number in the marijuana culture," previously reported by Bloomberg, with reference to the co-director of the security department of the Stephen Pakein Commission.
In doing so, Ilon Mask subsequently refused his plans to buy off the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit brought against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that the allegations of fraud were unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"The truth is the most important value of my life, and the facts will prove that I have never violated it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against Mask, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the sweats of the businessman were misleading, forcing the sellers of Tesla's shares to purchase paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Mask ' s reckless remarks had led to sharp fluctuations in course.
In September, Ilona Mask was accused of exchange fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.

From mutual brutality, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK barely got to love each other, joking Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump noted a good joke about his success on the front line to resolve the North Korean crisis.
After beginning with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now resolved relations so far that they are hardly in love with each other, and the President of the United States has noted.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that Barack Obama's team had such a relationship with the DPRK that it could not even reach the leadership of the country, but that it had simply not been taken off.
Then the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "red letters" to the White House, noted Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, was cruel to Kim Jong-un, which was mutual.
But now their relationship is so much that the leaders "have loved each other."
At the same time, Trump asked me not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Phenyan has recently stopped nuclear and missile testing and has also closed military sites.
All of this is the merit of his administration, I'm sure of the American president.

Nice called for "Moskovsky" to be removed by the Ukrainian product.
Ukrainian child writer and champion of the purity of Laris Nice's mother tongue called for the removal of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language" from Ukraine.
To do so, she proposes a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural nasty."
Nice shared his views on "the desirability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of the Surveyor.
She said that the Ukrainian product was currently being prepared - it was already in existence and was continuing to develop further.
In time, Ukrainians will recover from this Moscow language, she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian speech had previously been widely used on television and radio, but there was little room for it in public space.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the authorities ' actions prohibiting the use of Russian are, in its view, merely "extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Nice had previously shared the experience of maintaining the "sweet-speaking regime" in the Karpat children's camp, where she had been invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which had been in contact with her in Russian.
Nice threw a change into a girl without reaching her.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians calls "language schizophrenia," calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nice recently stated that the name Rusú had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was unable to escape the author ' s anger: by coming there and hearing people talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left by clapping the door.

"You missed a few matches because of the damage that you received at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you've held 90 minutes, then it's okay!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end there's a little bit of power to get nothing to happen.
And so, the doctors and the physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolevich Gashnave have led me to this game, for which they thank very much!
"What do you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and rebuilding, it's easier, and it's a good mood in the community.
Now we've got a white strip, even though it was black first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the cheerleaders."
"Did you miss the game for the time you didn't go to the field?"
"There's such a thing, I miss you a little bit, 'cause really, the unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thank the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

The charge for the Dagestan deputy was news.
The Soviet District Court of Mahačkala has detained for two months a member of the Daguestan Rajab Abdulaipov People ' s Assembly, suspected of participating in a criminal community that made a disability for bribes.
"JO" became aware of the details of the investigation, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazán Abdulaipov Rajab Abdulatipov, has now contributed to criminal action by the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Studies, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Rajab Abdulatipov was found to have lobbyed the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the Bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million roubles.
In the case of Magomed Mahachev, other heads and staff of the territorial medical and social medical and medical offices under his supervision, a criminal case has been brought against Art. 210 (establishment of and participation in a criminal community using a position of office), art. 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), art. 292 (serval fraud) and art. 159 (specially large fraud) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the findings of the investigation, in late 2013 Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his associates in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal community.
As head of the Russian Federal Migration Service ' s office in Dagestan and having links with the State authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as having a relative relationship with the Head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators consider that they "secured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with government officials to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his presence as head of the federal Kazakh institution, "Lead Bureau of Medical and Social Studies in the Republic of Dagestan," organized illegal disability determinations for citizens."
Following the disclosure of the information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, all I'm charged with today is all this new, completely unknown to me," he said.
The court arrested a deputy from "One Russia" not for 10 days before the charge was brought, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months, since his case included article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the prosecution of the investigation - up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Add that, according to Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, 2 October, and writes "Lenta.ru."
The day before it became known that the Serbian President had brought the army of the State into full combat because of the situation in Kosovo.
This is a Friday event when several dozen Kosovo Special Forces entered the area adjacent to the lake providing water to the Gazawater hydroelectric plant.
It is specified that the declared nuclear power plant is located in the territory of Kosovo, but is related to the Serbian energy system.
We recall that Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but in Belgrade it refused to recognize that fact.
Last spring, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Koschev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Russia ' s negative theme was virtually absent
The Head of the Committee of the Federation Council for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN Genassamble to be a success for Russia and does not exclude that it will be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of the present 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have become almost accustomed to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in order to be more stunned," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation had sometimes "as one of the three major threats to humanity, along with Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this range, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries that had been sufficiently unanimous in that regard."
At the 73rd session, he stressed that "the Russians were virtually absent from the negative key."
"If I carefully analyse the statement made by the President of the United States of America, the President of France, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not entirely accurate," the choir drew attention to the politician, noting that Russia "was no more a wall to train a tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfeld Main Committee does not rule out that this reflects a trend that he believes will "distribute the current session of the [UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, in two, three."
"I do not rule that this session may in some sense be a turning session," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's connection can move forward in international affairs."
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"Unfortunately not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is related to the fact that he believes that there is an "appropriate, sound view of Russia as not merely a possible, integral participant in solving the global problems of our time."
"I wouldn't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going to go somewhere where the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the Genassamble session] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and I have had my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if a year or five years ago the Russian view, the Russian vision of the world, in large measure, was not interested, the situation now is different," said the Chairman of the Sovfeld Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that "there is no answer to the questions posed by the so-called new liberal order, which represents the West, to address world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation, migration."
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more evident," expressed the confidence of Kosachev, stressing that in this sense "the current session is a successful Russian delegation for Russia."

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, as stated by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
However, he said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the removal of fighters from the demilitarized zone in Idlib of the Russian-sanctioned organization Jebhat al-Nusr, reports "RIA Novosti."
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Evfrath in the event of Kurdish desire for separatism.
At the same time, Muallema believes that negotiations with Kurdish SDF forces were good until the US broke down.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan agreed to establish, by 15 October, a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
It was previously reported that 37-year-old defence counsel negotiated a transition to Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT with reference to Mirror, the former captain of England's team, John Terry, led the Chelsea Youth Team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long served as a member of the London Club will be in charge of a team not older than 23 years old.
It is noted that Terry's trainer headquarters will replace Jody Morris, who left for Derby County.
Remember, in September Terry was close to moving to Moscow Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
The first Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the Russian convicted "spionage" Ukrainian journalist Roman Susšchenko for not being released from the walls.
She said that in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest, Suschenko FOB.
According to her, there is an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, where participants declared a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kreml prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them people who know you are hungry, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews, wherever the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian power, all of us, have not demanded pressure on the Kremlin, pressure Putin with one demand - the liberation of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all the political prisoners of the Kremlin and those who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbas and Crimea - told Gerashchenko.
It also expressed its confidence that the trials were being carried out by every Ukrainian, making us "sweet, tougher in protecting Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what evil is."
We recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Susšchenko, was detained by Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow Airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying with the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sušchenko to 12 years of a strict-regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found this verdict lawful.
Russian prisoners granted the Ukrainian last request before it was staged in the colony.
NASA reported approaching Earth as asteroid size with Big Ben.
The American Space Agency NASA reported that a major SP1 asteroid was approaching Earth, with a length of up to 160 m.
According to Daily Express, a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London fertilizer wheel.
However, there is no precise data on its size.
The speed with which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The minimum distance between the asteroid and the Earth will be 3 October.
Then it passes our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19th.
NASA assigned it to near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first video in history from the surface of the Asteroid Ryugu.
Two Japanese rovers (plane) launched from the Haybusa-2 probe were able to obtain unique footage.
The CM-2018 football lawn was attributed to Baste.

Wahtang Kikabidze on Cancer
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to deal with oncologies.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people of victory over cancer give hope to many sick people.
The famous actor Wahtang Kikabidze confessed to being only alive because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which was pronounced as a sentence.
"It's like a hammer hit me on the bottom of my skull.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
They started doing tests, they turned out to be bad things, and artery didn't miss blood.
They came to Moscow, they said there was a big rotten cyst in my head, and they did an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors for the cyst saw a tumor, told Kikabidze in "One Days" program.
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the threshold of his house.
But the actor's wife didn't let a living actor bury, and she was holy enough to be able to cope with the disease, and for over a year she hadn't left the bed of her beloved husband.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was around like a rock, confessed to an actor.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and now he lives happily in his home in the centre of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumors of his illness deny that there is no time to die, which is the case in the Network.
The creators of the Peacekeeper website have been added to the section "Cistile" by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto.
The reason was "the attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was found in "direct threats to the invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine" as well as "in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violations by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian law."
We will note that in front of Siyarto, the governor of Kievo-Pecher Lover Paul and the ruler of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moskovsky patriarts) of Onufry were pleased in the "Chystilite."
The reason was their opposition to receiving Tomos of the Ukrainian local church.
Previously, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatje, the President of Ukraine, Peter Porosenko, demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities named the sum of the gold parachute to the Vorongue Locker.
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronje region, Yuri Agibalova, was made under the Regional Public Positions Act.
However, the real sum of the gold parachutes released from the position of the official was several times lower than the amount shown in the media.
Such explanations were provided by the press service of the regional Government.
According to the law, the salary of the Agibalov post is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press service, the lump sum was set at 223,892 roubles, less income tax, rather than 1 million roubles, written by the media.
The Chinovnik has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His experience in public office is more than nine years.
This pension and lump-sum payment is made immediately after the dismissal, and explained to the RIA News Agency in the Government of the Region.
In doing so, the payment of the Agibalova supplement to the pension was suspended for appointment to State office and the amount of his salary remained unchanged from that of the preceding period.
The winner of the election of the governor of the Rio region, Alexander Guzev, took office on 15 September.
Ahibalova was released on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Negram Canal Nezigara published documents indicating that Ahibalova, who had left the post of Vice Governor, had paid a termination indemnity of 23 salaries, and two days after that he had again received a similar post without the introduction of a "wrio."
The deputy of the Gosdum called to tell the students about the damage to masturbation.
He holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience, he noted in an interview that masturbating teenagers caused harmful information they found on the Internet.
Fighting this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, adding a deputy.
Gennadius Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the Radio "Hovorit Moscow":
Within the overall sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the decline, because there is a risk to the child ' s sexual health, both the boy and the girl child.
The problem is objective, it is that children are matured early enough, and there are large scissors between their sexual maturity and the possibility of formal interpolity.
In the view of Onishchenko, the problem is being addressed by "beneficiency," silence "the problem of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate education for children.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are experiencing stereoism.
The deputy believes that learning about the harm of nanism is at the heart of the schools of the "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we're just not gonna understand, to put it mildly," the professor said.
Gennadius Onschenko is an active RPNA academy, member of the Bureau of RPNA, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Honorary doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Bureau of the Russian-wide public organization League of Health of the Nation.

As a result of the tragedy, several cars failed asphalt, and two young people died on the spot from burns.
AdG became the second most popular in Germany.
An anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angels Merkel's ratings fall.
Germans seem to have started to be seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a precipitous target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest social surveys indicate that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zehehofer are weak.
This week, AdG beat another record by raising the second line in the popular sympathy rating.
The right conservatives, with 17 per cent of popularity, managed to bypass social Democrats, who had about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point could be attributed to statistical error, but it should not be noted that the 2013 AdH of a small group of European economists had succeeded in becoming a serious political force.
The general-counting authority has so far continued to hold the HSS/HDS ruling unit, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points - as early as April, the support of Angela Merkel's block was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, which is headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in favour of Angel Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
To add that the social Democrats were followed by "green" (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent).
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative Party for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included citizens from the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group had initially become an opposition to the Government's course, but had first dealt only with economic issues, including Euro issues and EU cooperation.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's sponsorship of the weak economies of the EU, and did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German brand and of leaving the European Union completely.
In the face of the deepening immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed part of a full-fledged party that took up a niche of Euroskeptics and began to strongly criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the most recent parliamentary elections in 2017, the AG managed to run to Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternatives for Germany get seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens "the nation of fools."
The leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books of the remains of Drozd, admitted on live air that he considered his compatriots "the nation of the swamps."
They believe in TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov pointed out, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," a journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words by accusing him of not patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Committee of the Insular has begun to combat literature that has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities by prohibiting the import of 201 editions.

Canadians created a car in case of apocalypse, a magazine behind the wheel.
Anybody who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armoury.
Armoured Apocalypse Roschel Senator APC
The apocalypse isn't the only one making money for video games, film studios and books.
Now the new niche is also being developed by automobile companies.
For example, the Canadian Roschel Defence Solutions presented his armory apocalypse Senator APC.
In a fantasy-free time, the engineers of this company create armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who are not comfortable, but are placed in full safety in an entire armoured vehicle.
This bunker, or else you're not gonna call it a design because its reservation level is in accordance with standard B7, is fixed on the chassis of a powerful pickup truck Ford Super Dute.
His head, also armoured, is capable of protecting the capsule from grenade and anti-personnel mines.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
In order to prevent passengers from causing an explosive wave from breaking a shell near the vehicle, the car compartment is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For a safe view, Roschel Senator APC is equipped with a circular vision camera system with night vision function, as well as a watch tower on the roof.
There's no gun in the car.
Forequarter of the armoury apocalypse of Roschel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbody engine of 6.7 litres, all of which is transferred to four armoured wheels through a 6-stage automatic transmission box.
There's no chance of getting stuck at the armory of Roschel Senator APC's apocalypse.
It will be possible to see Roschel Senator APC's armory at a specialized exhibition in Washington in October.
Deadline of the Universe
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, 10 times the age of the world seen, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
A study of the international group of scientists is published in the library of e-prevents arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomic Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The experts came to these conclusions by observing the Subaru telescope with an HSC camera of about 10 million galaxies.
Looking at the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model of θCMM (Ζ Cold Dark Matter), evaluated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously considered.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that observations had provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of European Space Telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of θCMM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favour of the fact that the world seen would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the big gap.
There has been another attempt to bring together the organizers of the pension referendum.
The people ' s perception of pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow, on Saturday, a meeting of the general federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered different language (the entire Centre for the Fighter recorded five language versions).
They decided to apply to the CEC for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Do you not raise the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension under the pension law as of 1 July 2018?"
This wording was registered by a WOOD subgroup whose representatives did not participate in the congregation, but it was it which was considered to be the simplest and most legal term.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the Justice Russia member Ilí Swiridov (six subgroups) and RPF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voroneja and Orenburg, joined them.
Previously, Swiridov said to the Witnesses that invitations had been sent to all the initiators and that representatives of about 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenaov, the leader of the Vodode sub-group (which was supported by another 15 sub-groups), said, "Wedomes," that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend but an enemy."
Otis Rush's blue singer died.
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blue guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP with reference to his manager, Rick Bates.

Admiral has caused us great trouble.
Zinethula Bilaleddinov: Admiral has created great problems for us.

So there was such a solution," says the Bibleian press service of the club.
Elon Mask will leave as head of the board of directors Tesla.
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask will be required to resign as chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and to pay a fine of $20 million.

Previously, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Ilon Mask, the officials thought that he had misled Tesla's investors because the businessman had allowed the company to buy all the shares at a high price of $420 for paper.
In the game "Loko" - "Ahmat" of Turbin's mistakes blew up like an abundance of horns.
The former union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of Eugene Turbin's arbitrator at the 9th tour of the Russian Lokomotive Championship, Ahmat, and examined the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you estimate Eugenia Turbin's judge at the Lockomotiv game, Ahmat?
- I believe that the arbitrator has confirmed that he is not fit to judge the matches of the Russian Prime League.
I am surprised that the attacks at the Spartacus Fifth Round meeting, Dinamo, Turbin himself, and the DSI leaders did not make serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private blackouts blew up like a horn of abundance.
For example, on the 50th minute, Eder's railwayman is collapsing with his hands in his penal space, Ahmat Rodolfo's lawyer.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty.
- How do you estimate an episode involving Idova that was on the 82nd minute when it seemed like the ball was in his hand?
- I think it was a deliberate play by the lawyer's hand in his penal square.
Turbin was close to the moment, seeing the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by the reserve judge, Sergei Karasev.
However, all three of them were asleep, and the penalty wasn't appointed.
So the match is distorted, and sports justice has been violated.
It was the same time that the judge had been pushed out of his mind and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest counsel, who violated the rules in the fight against the Crimean, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he was strongly encouraged to do so.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second burner?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card weren't exactly on the case.
The second one wouldn't be logical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of justice that some teams were making penalti for violations such as the Idov episode, and some weren't.
What do you value the footballer's words?
- Depends on what to understand under double standards.
There was a penalty.
He wasn't given.
So the arbitrator doesn't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who's playing.
When he played "Lokomotive" on Saturday, Ahmat has serious claims for Turbin's work because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played a rape charge against Judge Cavanaugh at the start of SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared on the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on the NBC channel.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at the Senate hearing on rape charges.
A candidate to the US Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotions and details of his stories during an interview with Senator Amy Clubushar.
For example, Cavanaugh has repeatedly confessed to his love for beer, but has stated that he has never been drunk before he was insane.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Cavanaugh stated that he had been a virgin in those years.
These moments also played Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking, and I wasn't thinking about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the most drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everybody knows it," said the judge in Matt Damon's performance.
Cavanaugh had previously been elected Supreme Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs acting weird.
The American singer Barbra Streizand stated that her dead dog clones were completely different from the original pet.
"They don't look like each other.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it's impossible to cloneavage the soul," stressed the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streizand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, a coton de tulear, named Samantha, who had to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the dog of Chihuahua in the name of Miracle Milly, named the world's smallest dog, was cloned 49th time.
Professionals are engaged in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so minimal.
The US was thinking about Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the US, Russia's maritime blockade can begin to gain the advantage of the world's energy market.
The American authorities have fought so hard for the success of the global hydrocarbon market, which is ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, spoke about the possibility of a maritime blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform police but civil functions, including implementing natural resource policies.
Zinke ' s statement therefore came under the authority of his department, even though political colours had not been removed.
At an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that, thanks to US naval forces, sea routes in the Middle East region were controlled and could block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russia's supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continued to receive the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for the revitalization of Moscow in the region, I am confident of Zinke.
The Minister made it clear that the US was still looking for leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to be embarrassed by Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure in this direction - considers Zinke to be an acceptable measure.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Captain Chelsea and England's team John Terry, about why he visited the ninth tour of Russia's Spartacus Championship - Rostov (0:1).
"I've got a club in Russia that I'm following.
I've been watching very recently, and I was interested in looking at him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a cheerleader because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize for the decision I made, and Terry's word is from Chelsea's cheerleaders website.
Remember, Rostov, with 18 points, went third on the tournament table, and Spartacus was placed on the fifth line with 15 points in the asset.
On the next round, the red and white on October 7th, they're gonna play with Enise, and Valeria Carpina's cell phones will be taken by Orenburg the previous day.
The expensive violin was thrown into the pawnyard for no price.
When in the town of Somerville, Massachusetts, a lobard of LBC Boutique and Loan, a man brought a violin that looked like an old and unrepresentative tool, a lobard worker offered only $50.
But the experienced manager of Dylan McDermitt's store suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked for an expert's advice.
It turns out that the violin was manufactured in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist master Ferdinando Galiano and estimated at $250,000.
Only matches to the violin are estimated at $16,000.
The investigation found that the violin had been stolen from one of the city's residents a long time ago, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin hit the man who put it in the pawnshop, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now all the pawns in the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we're going to have an exciting confrontation: "Spartacus" will take place at his stadium in Rostov, under the leadership of Valerie Karpina, a man who is known to be not a stranger to the "people's team."
This meeting is particularly picky because the clubs now have an equal number of points of 15, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving out of the far-fetched Zenita and being in one glass from the Krasnodar, which tomorrow plays with Dinamo.
The red-whites now have a delicate strip: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, and in the League of Europe, the team Massimo Carrera suddenly flew "Rapida" and recently handed over to the Ahmatou house.
After a derby with the CSCA, who ended a fair one, Spartacus, with a minimum score and with no difficulty played at the Black Sean Cup, and it is too early to talk about whether Russia's most popular club has come to an exit from the crisis.
The "Rosts" three matches couldn't win in a row, but the defeats don't know five matches.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the win-win series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting of the Carpine Rostova with Spartacus ended in favour of the capital team.
It's starting at 7:00.

The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are more dangerous, and the enemies operate in grey zones with cyberattacks and false news, and the Minister added.

Hunt mentioned a history of poisoning in the English city of Solsbury in March this year by ex-Colonel GRU Sergei Scrypal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.

And in the future, Sacks noted that Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.

"I hope they're also gonna support it, 'cause it's almost every game of a full stadium, a great atmosphere.

In fact, we lost a micro match of 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to get this match out, even though there were moments.
But I'll still take the blame.
'Cause they must have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was another team."
"It's a freakin' cube."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice on the Voice Show.
The voice 60+ audience is accusing the mentor, Leonid Agutin, of "unbelievable cuffing and incredible poding."
When he learned his father's voice from the first night of his blind audition, Nikolay Agutin hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the perpetrator.
But the children's feelings were won, and he chose a relative to his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but pardoned the mentor in the first phase of bias.
But the joke was prolonged, and the star's father took the place of more worthy artists completely unjustly.
And now the audience isn't ready to forgive Agutin this injustice.
Yesterday, we, the showers, were outraged by the fantasy and frank pursuit of our loved ones into the final ladder.
I already doubted that Agutina had the strength and the conscience not to drag his dad to the end of the first place, told Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in the TV program.
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin "slept" the fine singers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wanted to see his father on the show.
But as it turns out, it's not like the audience wants an objective assessment and a really talented singer in the final, and now Agutin's discredited the show.
"I feel sorry for the Voice of the Agutina team - they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how he loved Dad, he was supposed to be a professional today."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"To remove two talented people from the project and to leave in the project his dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can he then call a mentor?"
"Like dad sings, make him a concert in Cremla for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Big Family show.
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutina."
"Well, then, on your own show, you have to ask dad to perform, not on a show that's made for money 1 canal."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a single dad should give me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surguth, with a great voice and a teembro slime, and dad Agutin got to the finale?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on the stage and on the screen for decades!
That is because you will not be able to pass through the treasure."
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's a circle of blah and a humming.
And the money in the family's budget isn't gonna be too much!
The theater of absurdity is going on."
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, the son of Gradsky had appeared on blind auditions.
Then the metre didn't come in the head to take his son to his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Agutin couldn't do as a professional.

The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the Russian Federation ' s expedition to the Moon
The head of the Institute for Space Research of the RAN, the respondent member of RAN Anatoly Petrukovich, told RIA Newsy about a possible research programme for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now working on the development of such work.
"Unsolved opinion is not yet available," the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one option was the deployment of a low frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, which would avoid the interference caused by the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space-based radio radiation sources," added Petrukovich.
He also believed that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, the cosmonauts should be involved in the search for a primitive organic satellite on Earth, and they consider the scientist to be a scientist.
This could help to determine how life comes from planets.
Previously, the head of Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a piloted flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.
An offended client threw a basket of fecals at the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Pittersburgh (Florida), which is called "the tooth" at the 7-Eleven network manager's 24-hour shop: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he entered the store and threw on the floor and on part of the contents of the boxed baskets.
The basket was made up of feces and urine that Simmes "received" from nearby mobile biota.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the "hosts."
He was imprisoned and released on bail for $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of property and criminal offence, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime appears to be more funny than serious, the judgement may be harsh enough, as he has been repeatedly violated by the law, including large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in a state of disrepair and abuse of animals.

I couldn't do anything, and it hurt so much.
Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it hurts so much.
The Russian pilot, Williamsa, Sergei Sirotkin, commented on the outcome of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"I mean, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between the two cars that got me on fire.
I lost all the positions I played on the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
I'm stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us went to the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air, and we'd get back to speed, but the rubber was gone.
Plus fighting with his partner, he was in contact with him too.
I understand he was a little wrong.
We ended up in this situation on the most unbelievable track of the season, and I couldn't do anything, and it really hurts, honestly.
I don't want to talk about it anymore, says Sirotkin RIA News.
Remember that Sirotkin was in a race at the 18th Grand Prix of Russia, winning the British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpiszev called the absurd removal of Gwenkov and Runko from the foundation of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR), Shamil Tarpishev, commented on the suspension of the footballers of the Moscow "Spartacus" Denis Gwenkov and Andrea Pornco from training with the main composition following a bark to criticize the chief coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports Sport Weekand.
Carrera's actions were totally absurd.
It's ridiculous to pay attention to such things.
I totally disagree with what Carrera does.
It's just deepening the decorum on the team.
First of all, it's poems, you can read them and take them as much as you like.
I wouldn't have responded to this in Carrera's place.
Everybody has an opinion.
Second of all, everyone wants to have a good time.
If Gznkov and Knunko put their hands on it, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I don't think Italians have the flexibility to understand the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so this situation didn't have to blow up at all.
Maybe you should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus doesn't have a lot to do in different lines, and there's a lack of respect after joining young people.
The relationship inside the team does not seem to add optimism to this match."
The game of the two teams will take place on 30 September and begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
Previously, Spartacus John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Team.
Siriusa's educators discussed natural-like technologies with scientists
Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute."
A presentation by researchers took place within the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Naturally Sound Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the Education Centre on 29 September.
Lectia opened a documentary entitled "Kurchatov Codes," during which President Kurchatov Institute, RAN correspondent member Mikhail Kowalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The student's lecture is published on Sirius' website.
The schoolgirls learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
To address this problem, the organizers of the forum said that the natural-like technologies that young scientists are working on today would help.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, as well as the risks that inevitably arise in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a tremendous good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of natural-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There's a negotiable side - targeted intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car, people were killed under wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of the technology at once.
I'm creating medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quote the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting participants.
Speakers were presented by the candidate for physico-Mathematic Sciences, head of the Kurchto complex of the INBICS natural-like technologies of the CRI "Kurchatov Institute" Julia Diakova and head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX technology, Viacheslav Demin.

Kemerechan has perverted the herd of barans in the cemetery.
On 30 September, a social media account was broadcast on a famous Kemerov page from a witness that a local cemetery was freely dispersed by horny animals.
The animals of a small herd went between the fences and the grass was pulled out.
Commentators expressed differing views: one of the local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery and that their appetite could even help to clear the land from the weeds and herbs, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have to behave in the spirit of:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing to do with the barans.
Of course you won't tell them they're squealing, but it's not the case." (still) noted in his report an outraged composter.
In one way or another, one of the witnesses noted that the problem of animal species in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
How's it right to make it happen?
There's no word to push.
That's right to take care of it.
The word "depress" in the meaning of "extreme, exert influence, influence" only happens against the background, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "win."
We use that word to think it's happening from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "win" are not only ethically not only not close, but even, in some sense, opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
Dwing (cranny, obsolete) means "sufficient, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything to satisfy."
It's good to be happy, it's kind of a kind of lovely word.
He used to have the meaning of "don't depend on anything, to have a self-respecting meaning" - "to do what is good for himself."
The old-Slavian "daughter" is related to the word "worship" and "wow."
To give, to suppress, to be completely different.
These words are truly scary of "patriots": daos is a "wolf," deya - "death" and dvaidī - "pull".
The similar background expression of the words "pressure" and "win" as well as the imminent obsession of the latter were forced to enter into a treaty.
So we've got the same "d" that's used in the letters through "a," which is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
Well, that's right to make fun of it.
But this word is outdated, in its right meaning, which is no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/humans have a negative impact on you on the top, use the word "press."
You can also use the pressure design, but remember it's a cancellular.

Our car is much slower than Mercedes.

But the behaviour of our car was the best from the beginning of the weekend."
"In the course of your qualification, you did not give up at Sebastian Fettel's speed, but in the end, the backlog was visible.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was pretty good, but then one of the Mercedes racings came forward.
He was preparing for an attempt and still managed to miss me, but I think I've lost some time on it.
But it didn't have much effect on the result."

"Please, yes, but you never know how it's gonna work out.
It's not gonna be easy anyway, because our car is much slower than Mercedes' cars.

Volunteers work here with rescue workers.
One of them says that he helped save three people and heard the voices of those to whom he had not yet managed: "We tried to seduce them so that they would not fall in spirit, even though they were trapped, between life and death.

Russia, through an operation in Syria, has cut itself off from terrorists
In three years, the Russian military operation in Syria has killed some 100,000 terrorists, of whom 85,000 terrorists have destroyed the Russian Air and Space Force.
This was reported on the occasion of the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the VCS, the head of the Federation Defence and Security Council Committee, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of air damage: air and space forces attacked and continued to strike the exact targets of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites have been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition storage, reinforcements and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists' defense was hacked into, which was a decisive contribution to the development of Syrian government forces, transferring Interfax.
In doing so, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia itself to be protected from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IG, prohibited in Russia) and "Jabhat-an-Nusru" (not prohibited in Russia).
According to the General of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian fighters and some 5,000 citizens of the post-Soviet countries have fought on the side of the IH, and TTAS is being handed over.
And it's only a registered person, except those who were not identified, who emphasized Bondar.

Thus, he noted that in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise it would be evil "toss to us."

Mitropolith Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the CPI with fascists' actions
The head of the Internal Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Mittropolite Ilarion, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like, in fascist Germany, putting a yellow sharp star on the Jew, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was created for, " said the mr.polite on the television channel "Russia-24" (interfax citata).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to have full control of the CPI and "to outlaw it," the clergy believe.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It has been previously learned that the deputies of Verkhovna are working on the implementation of Bill No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

Given the situation that has arisen and the information we have and the threats of massacres that spread, it is clear that we will have to survive something."
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the lieutenant of the laura stressed that it was likely "to be necessary for you to be physically present."
The priest added: "Lenin's granddaughters, in spirit, are threatening to kill, so we will protect our holy place."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Laurea - the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world holy - must be prepared to protect it, and it is stated in the message.
Mittropolit called on those who led the believers astray not to go about.
The CPI has a canonical status as determined by Tomos on 29 October 1990 from the Church Mother.
Now, someone wants to be dependent on a news patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope of Roman Varfolome.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us as Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," the lieutenant of the laura noted.
He recalled that the CPI had, since October 1990, been canonically independent and fully autonomous in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" pointed out the Mittropolite of Potaev Vladimir, calling on the faithful and all citizens to ask if others have Thomas's faiths, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe in some measure have settled and determined what temple they are going to go to.

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in a referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, 30 September, a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the name of the Republic of Macedonia is taking place.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, the "Intern Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (WMRO-DPMIN), Christian Mitzkoski, said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As the press secretary of the Party, Naum Stoilkowski, explained, Mitzkoi decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the treaty that considered "the destruction."
According to the Spokesperson, the current referendum addresses the question of the country ' s renaming and no more than the party ' s strategic objective of achieving NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, President George Ivanov of Macedonia refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence; the Macedonian leader considered the country ' s renaming a negative factor.
"A new semi-verified State with a new name is being established," said Ivanov.
The Agreement on the New Official Name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during the solemn ceremony on the coast of Lake Prespé, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve a multi-year dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje ' s path to NATO and the EU, resembles the TASS.

The US is increasing the production of opiates in Afghanistan
The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was much said in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record of the number of bloody terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans." Patrushev noted.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't begin much yesterday.
Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, Al-Qaida terrorist group ( forbidden in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States to be in Afghanistan.
It's not even been a month since America and NATO allies started a military operation called "Indestructive Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
A multi-year American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And the world's life is even more ghost than it is then.
American troops have been fenced for dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy money from the fighters, just don't touch them.
The Government of Afghanistan controls less than 40 per cent of the country ' s territory, according to Patrushev.
50 per cent of the Taliban are prohibited in the Russian Federation.
Another 10 per cent for ISIL terrorists (not allowed in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-haliphate in Central Asia, just as it failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with that.
It is also encouraging that, over the 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opotates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of the area planted by opium poppy and multi-million-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country's name.
The Agreement on the Renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be known as Macedonia, as an attempt against a Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkowski, a political scientist: "By thanking this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia has the right to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will establish the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises cannot bring happiness to all."
The country ' s name is the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against is the conservative opposition and the President of Georgia, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Colchina Chilemanov, Macedonia does not make sense of joining the EU - enough to have a partnership with it: "Some of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, led by Zaev, is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole."
