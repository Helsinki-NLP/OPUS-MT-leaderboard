Rapidly growing cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thereby reaffirming that, despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care offices, there is a need to improve the level of preparedness for the influx of patients from COVID-19 who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown ethics were recorded in Uhan Province of China, Hubei.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of infection was a new species of coronavirus, now known as the coronavirus of the Type 2 heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease known as SARS-COV-2 has become a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 are exposed to the disease in light form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases are more severe with hospitalization and the remaining 6 per cent are critical when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyses trends in cumulative COVID-19 morbidity in each European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) country and in Britain and compares them with trends in China's Hubei province.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with those of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now evolving in the rest of the world, according to the same dynamics as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The three first confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them returned from Uhan Province of China, Hubei.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 deaths, including 1,441 fatal deaths, were reported in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world every day from official sources such as the Ministries of Health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the distribution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
The COVID-19 prevalence rate was calculated as a 14-day cumulative COVID-19 prevalence rate, taking into account the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 development in EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain
Trends in cumulative COVID-19 prevalence during the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK were generally in line with trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to rise on approximately 21 February and a sharp leap of this indicator (additional material) occurred on 28 February 2020.
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and in Great Britain there were similar trends in cumulative COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to the same for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered at 8.00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, different responses by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for recognizing cases of disease and different patient selection rules for COVID-19 analysis, including "verifying" testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients were required intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already filled to the maximum extent possible.
To date, only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases (not reported) are available for COVID-19 patients in hospitals and (or) in intensive care in the EU/EEA.
However, such data need to be systematically collected to supplement current surveillance data, which are the subject of the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in the intensive care and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 presents scenarios for modelling the loading of health system resources with estimates for the hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of lack of accessible beds in intensive care offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As cases are now grouped into certain EU/EEA and British regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a particular territorial group, information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended to provide, if possible, territorial units at level 2 levels for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is rapidly evolving.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be ready for a long-term contact scenario with SARS-COV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive therapy, for example, which can be observed in affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, an operational, proactive and integrated approach to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 is essential, following a shift from deterrence to minimization, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision-making and in hospitals, it may simply not be sufficient time to understand, adopt and adjust its response accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures designed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a small period of time in which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks the health system in other EU/EEA countries will face the influx of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of the second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the SARS-CoV homologic virus, which led to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from volatile mice and similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower degree of disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new infections, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethics, viralology, diagnosis, treatment, projection of further currents and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The spring festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on 25 January in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high degree of coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the SARS-COV-2 virus on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease a coronavirus infection of 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Ouhan and spread rapidly throughout the country, and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been identified, more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "war number one for society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 were published in less than two months, including articles on its viruses, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis and treatment, beginning with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus from a range of patients.
This review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other coronavirus-induced diseases, the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at this time about the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronavirus has traditionally been a pathogen, which is not fatal to humans and is mainly responsible for about 15 per cent of total respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century we have faced twice the highly pathogenic human coronavirus, i.e., the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a report of the Pneumonia Clusters of Unknown Origin was first submitted to the National Health Commission of the CR from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal incident in Uhan was recorded.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly into neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that medical workers were infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted to a person.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhan, and urban public transport ceased.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, it was noted that 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the market for seafood in Uhan, which was considered to be the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already infiltrated some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scope and risk of a outbreak have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) was presented on the basis of a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 has been exposed to all age groups, but mostly to people between 30 and 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusters mainly in Hobei province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days were spent from the moment of the symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
From the moment the symptoms occurred to death, the average day was 9.5 (4.8-13).
The baseline for reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-405) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-482.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, which coincided with large-scale traffic on the eve of the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
The mortality rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% C: 1.10-1.86%), and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% C: 2.02-459%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 contamination were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus are the subfamily of large octopus viruses containing a thread of a meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronavirus are known to be affecting people.
In the case of coronavirus of the type SARS and MERS, glycoprotherine of the larvae pulmonary educator (S) is linked to the clement receptors of the second-type enzyme (ACE2) and dipepticilpeptica-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by a membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the virus RNC gene; after the replication of the virus genome, the genome RNC, together with the octopose glycoprotheene and protein nucleocapsid, generates virion-containing vesiculars, then connects to the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-Cov-2 were issued on 10 January 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta coronavirus, with a genome of 99.98 per cent consistent with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first flash point of the disease, on the Juanan seafood market in Uhan.
Genetically SARS-Cov-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultratonous cuts of human respiratory epithelium by means of an educative electronic microscopy.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-Cov-2 is associated with the ACE2 enzyme less than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients a less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-COV-2 may also generate previously unknown short-lived protein, coded orf3b, and secret protein coded orf8.
A protein orf3b of the SARS-Cov-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the IGNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the authors ' team, headed by Zhou (Zhou), submitted reports on the cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of the full-size ACE2 enzyme, with the authorization of 2.9 Å in a combination with a B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which is evidence of the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for a drug screening to suppress SARS-Cov-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats from which the virus was transmitted to a person through cyvet and camels, respectively.
By means of a phylogetic comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 were bats because the new virus was 96 per cent identical to the two SARS coronavirus, namely the coronavirus of bats SL-CovZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown how the virus has become an intermediate owner, which has succeeded in overcoming the species barrier and infected the human being; the route of transmission is also yet to be clarified.
Mr. Ji (Ji) suggested with colleagues that the vectors of the virus from bats to humans had become snakes, during which there had been a homoological recombination in S-protein.
According to his study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pagolines - long-earned mammals that are fed by ants and often used in traditional Chinese medicine - were potential intermediate masters of SARS-Cov-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarities between the pagoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-Cov-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50 per cent humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the virus can be effectively blocked by air, 75 per cent of lead alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peroxide acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorexidin.
The human population as a whole does not enjoy immunity from SARS-COV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there is no data on the detailed studies carried out on the immune response to SARS-COV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to earlier studies of other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, the virus in the host ' s system first recognizes the immunized system by immunizing receptors (PRDs), including receptors of lectin C-type, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the ripeness of dendrit cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which deter the spread of the virus and accelerate the fagocitises of macrofagues against viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-Bell of SARS-CoV, the immune response may be avoided.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-limfocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammation cytoquins that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit the functions of T-cells by causing their programmed death.
Gumoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against virus infection.
For example, antibodies from the healing patient neutralized MERS-COV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system leads to the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst scenario lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by clustering, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or are affected by the immune system.
According to a study of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-COV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly from 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged three days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
More recently, the study described above, based on 8,866 demography data, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame for the quarantine measures introduced, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease without symptom.
The general practice has been to quarantine 14 days for persons with contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only manifestation of or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry coughs, impaired breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, pain in the throat, scum, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had an oscillation and (or) hypoxia a week after the outbreak of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease has advanced rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis even if there is no pathology on the chest.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent were high temperatures, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent were inhaled and 3 per cent diarrhea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of cases of family infection and transmission of the virus from immunized infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, who also had high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47%) and a breath (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial lung ventilation, much higher than COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhoea (26 per cent) and throat pain (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperatures (99-100 per cent), dry coughs (29-75 per cent), oscillation (40-42 per cent), diarrhoea (20-25 per cent) and throat pain (13-25 per cent), and artificial ventilation of lungs requires 14-20 per cent of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Based on the earlier study, the baseline of reproduction (R0) for SARS-COV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95 per cent of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-Cov on symptoms, mortality rates and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above indicators show a higher prevalence rate for SARS-Cov-2 than for MERS-COV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than the last two.
Thus, it will be more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clusters often occur when infected within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or found together in any transport, such as cruise liners.
Patients often travelled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted those infected or ill during the last two weeks prior to the outbreak of the disease.
According to the reports, however, people may be carrying the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients treated after being discharged from the hospital can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocites (especially lymphocites) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients have been exposed to leukocitis levels < 4x109/L, including leukocite levels < 1x109/L, as well as an elevated level of asparaguine-aminotransfease and virus.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were detected, and most patients were exposed to elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood eritrocytes.
Patients with severe periods of illness have increased the D-dimer level, the product of fibrin decay in blood, and the number of lymphocites has been steadily reduced.
The majority of COVID-19 patients found pathology in the X-ray study of the chest, characterized by uneven leaks on both sides or by a type of "match glass" in their lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (RH).
In the development of the ESM, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis result in a significant disruption of the gas exchange.
The function of the Pneumocytes of Type I and II reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing lungs ' ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray research often coincide with the worst cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed that pneumocytes, gyalaline membranes and intertcanic lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear sync cells in lung patients who died from disease were consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ORZ and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis was the method of detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA through a polymeracular chain reaction with the reverse transcriptasis (PCD with reverse transcriptasis).
However, given the high level of false results that could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, since 13 February 2020 China had begun to diagnose on the basis of clinical evidence (not relying exclusively on the PCR with reverse transcriptasis).
A similar situation was the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data from the history of disease, clinical evidence, laboratory tests and X-ray studies.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang (Feng Zhang) described a protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology, based on the re-CRISPR, for the detection of SARS-COV-2; this method allows for the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-Cov-2 with a density of 20 x 10-18 mol/l to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of the reference sample) using tracer strips less than an hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Owing to the lack of experience in dealing with previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide COVID-19 patients with only support therapy while attempting to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity deposers, steroids, healing plasma, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of cured patients should be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2, mainly lungs are attacked, as well as other organs that express ACE2 such as iron and kidneys may be less striking.
Nevertheless, the disruption of work and the denial of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of lungs, are critical to reducing symptoms and saving lives, which are designed according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modified extrapulmonal hemorrhage method used to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory deficiency.
In addition, maintaining water balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the functions of vital organs, are essential for patients from SARS-COV-2.
It is known that the citocinian storm is the result of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with the SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytoxin storm is a form of a systemic ignition process developed in response to a series of cytoquins, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytoquins encourage immunocites to release a huge amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ORZ and polyorganic insufficiency.
The suppression of immunity is crucial in treating the citocinian storm, especially in patients in difficult conditions.
The cytocin storm was treated by corticosteroids and tocilysumabs, monoclonal antibodies serving as interlequin inhibitor-6.
Other treatment techniques for the citocinous storm based on the suppression of immunity include the modulator of the immune reaction aimed at controlling T-clots; the blockade on the production of IGN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; the suppression of the Yanus-Kinase; the use of blinatuomab, citocinary signals 4 and hystondeacetalase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the consequences of the fallout processes, steroids are widely used in the treatment of SARS viruses as bearers of immunity.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe lung injuries from SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonekosis, which significantly reduce the forecast.
However, short courses of corticostoroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective anti-retroviral therapy.
However, the internal introduction of remdesiver, nucleotide analogue, proved to be effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed anti-aurus drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, the remdesiver also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with a single-chain RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead provided this drug to China for steam research on patients infected by SARS-COV-2, and the results of these studies are looking forward to it.
In addition, baricytinib, α-interferon, lopinavire/ritonavir and Ribavirin were suggested as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combinated lopinavire/ritonavire treatment can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side action.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs designated to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibodies
The collection of blood from patients treated with contagious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy populations has long been used.
Indeed, the blood of healing patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to combat pathogen.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin produced by B-limfocytes to control pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and target them.
On the basis of this assumption, a plasma from blood samples from a group of patients treated by COVID-19 was released, which was then introduced to 10 seriously ill patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms have improved, the incidence of inflammation has decreased and the virus load has also increased blood poisoning with oxygen.
However, to suggest a mass application of this method before specific therapy is carried out, it is necessary that there is not yet a test or explanation.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some deficiencies in the plasma application should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can over-immune the immune system and cause cytokin syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low, and there is a large need for plasma to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to design and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify cured patients and to define a genetic code for effective antibodies or screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to mass antibodies production.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theories.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or undefined because it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with a light and medium severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe state of illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Liang Hua Qing Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) capsules were found effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of survivors from COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Nincia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, the lowest rate of recovery (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since evaluation should take into account many other influences, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published a study comparing treatments exclusively by Western medicine and combined treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of hospital care was significantly lower for patients who had been treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who had been treated only by Western methods.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to suffer from symptoms (from light to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group that was treated only in Western techniques (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely monitored studies carried out on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, where possible, a description of the mechanism of action and to explain the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mainly afraid of acute and even fatal disease, and those who are shut down for quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and coughs, as well as side-effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
At the early stages of the outbreak of disease caused by the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, heightened anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorization, psychotic symptoms, deliciaries and even suicidal behaviour.
Mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people ' s anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to COVID-19 patients, persons under suspicion and contact with them, as well as to all other people who require it.
Psychological support should establish multidisciplinary mental health teams, provide clear information with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-COV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal vectors and infected people to susceptible hostes and are often used in addition to the anti-vaviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to establish S-protein vaccines designed to provide long-lived and highly reactive antibodies and (or) protection immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed lively weakened vaccines for SARS viruses.
However, prior to clinical research, there is still a need to determine the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural environment when applied to age patients, the pattern of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against zoonosis virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new case has ever been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic incidents and clustering of diseases caused by the MERS virus, which are emerging in the Middle East and spread to other regions, continue to occur through the conservation of zooonic sources in endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using an activated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and elements of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated for animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the scourge of the epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long period (average of 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and to the dynamic modification of the coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe illness.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of the disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on clinical studies submitted to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prediction of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive therapy were more likely to have background diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not require such treatment (average of 66 years as compared with 51 years), which shows that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Prevalence and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardia and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2-Changiocytes, which could lead to a breakdown of liver performance in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein level in blood reflects the severity of the ignition process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered a potential prognostic factor in the current of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that consideration should be given to the relationship between C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the projection of COVID-19.
In addition, a higher level of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagin-aminotransferaz, alanine-aminotransferazas and creatinkines may also predict the result.
These enzymes, in large quantities, are identified by different organs, especially hearts and livers, and their emissions occur when tissues are damaged.
They are therefore traditionally cardboards or liver dysfunctions.
Key clinical symptoms: To predict results and complications in COVID-19 treatment, the X-ray thorax research and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, along with other factors.
The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are the bearers of immunity commonly used in infectious diseases as supplementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammation process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, avascular osteonecrososis has developed in many of the survivors, causing life disabilities and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the use of steroids to treat COVID-19 patients should be used in small doses and short courses.
Mental stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen acute stress because they often have to withstand long quarantine periods, cope with high uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, they must be provided with psychological counselling and long-term support.
According to the demographic studies undertaken so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in lower respiratory routes, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronavirus causing conventional cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory tracts and cause weak symptoms or cause no symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of illness or have not yet completed the incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which makes epidemiological surveillance very difficult.
However, it was believed that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, while in most cases there has been no early transmission.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to declare a general quarantine in Uhan and neighbouring cities and to extend the quarantine regime to almost all the population, which has been introduced to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures are causing enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of silence will last three to four months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues estimated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which looked much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world ' s population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that the SARS-COV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat lubricating from patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the reduction in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an impact.
According to the initial projections, Ebola fever was to hit up to a million people and cause the deaths of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to be controlled.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the ability of the SARS-COV-2 virus can weaken, and it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus with a human being over time.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Figure 55).
The SARS-COV-2 virus has a high rate of transmission through coughs or sneeze, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the calumny, which means that it is also possible to transmit the oral-prefect method.
According to a recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases examined may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defence in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the face; and surgical masks and class N95 respirators ( Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Chemical masks do not give microcaps fluids from those potentially infected to fly in the air and land on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Serium No. 1860s) can protect against viron inhalation of between 10 and 80 nm, they only release 5% of virons; the SARS-COV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, both of which are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks laid together, medical personnel who are directly in contact with patients must wear a class N95 mask ( Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health workers should wear a platooned protective robe in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses may also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-COV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have fallen into his body through the inflammated eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent personal shields or closed-type protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are strongly encouraged to have their hands washed more frequently by disinfecting detergent means, to try not to leave their homes while respecting self-imsolation and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
An acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a metre distance.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not previously been known to humanity, its high degree of similarities with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have been an alarming signal to China, taking into account its experience during the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, it was only after 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Huhan Center for Disease Control calmed citizens, reporting that the new virus had low contagism and limited reproductiveity in human-to-human transmission and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially during the period when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and it has been overlooked a critical time when the disease could have been kept within Uhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements because each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development rather than to comfort the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly test and improve the social response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of the severe acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an outbreak of COVID-19 has given rise to the sense of re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and the mortality rate among older persons is also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate from SARS is higher than for COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is immature, while patients with SARS are usually infected only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative conventional samples for SARS-COV-2.
On the other hand, treated patients can again show positive samples on the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-COV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homoologist between SARS-COV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus of volatile mice, we still cannot claim that the SARS-Cov-2 infection occurred from bats.
What animal became an intermediate view that transmitted the virus from the original master, such as bats, to the human being?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely stop the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation may worsen at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-COV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into respiratory cells and triggers subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with the production of ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is the epidemic going to last?
How is the virus genetically evolving in human-to-human transmission?
Will it be the cause of the global pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS, or will it be repeated periodically like influenza?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonous origin of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and their hosts, including people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCoV) caused a lung disease, such as a common cold.
The flashes of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus can be.
The emergence of the coronavirus of severe acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 again drew attention to the coronavirus and surprised us at the high transmission, but the lower pathogenicity of the virus compared to the SARS-CoV related virus.
The coronavirus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding of its zooonic origin will be very useful.
Most of the human coronavirus come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate storage tanks of some human coronavirus are also known.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronavirus can also shed light on the coronavirus pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their detection, their zooonic origin and the ways in which they are transmitted interspecies.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of media and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease ' s current are noted.
Coronavirus is a family of the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of bolt viruses with one positive polar thread of the RNC.
These viruses, with the largest number of RNA-containing viruses with a genome of between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides, were named because of their form, which, when considered under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, the coronavirus contain unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genomes contain two large open partially overlapping reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in the polyprotein of pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further reprocessed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, meaning nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including schipvid protein (S), lumber protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoportein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus have also encoded a number of linescic accessor proteins.
Based on the differences in the sequences of protein / coronavirus are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus), the species of beta coronavirus includes most human coronavirus and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronavirus is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta coronavirus.
For thousands of years, the coronavirus have constantly overcome cross-species barriers, and some have evolved to dangerous pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus are known.
These include the human alpha-coronavirus HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The remaining five beta coronavirus include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, heavy acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus of the second type SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light shape, such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-COV viruses, MERS-COV and the recently discovered SARS-COV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of lower respiratory tracts in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory disease (RH) and of exclusivity symptoms.
The first human coronavirus of HCOV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of nonsoiled patients suffering from the cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were ill, with a total mortality rate of approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
Founded in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-COV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, had claimed more than 3,320 lives and more than 91,000 people were infected.
A warning signal has been received and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus have zooonic origins, and their sources are bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets are evidence of the evolutionary nature of the origins of all human coronavirus from volatile mice, to which viruses have been well adapted and where pathogenic properties do not manifest themselves, but display wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zooonic mechanism of origin of human coronavirus will make it possible to understand their natural history, the drivers of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for a container, intermediate and amplifying SARS-COV-2, which is essential to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review provides general information on zooonic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus occurred are not usually pathogens for their storage media, but are pathogenic after the interspective transmission of the new medium.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronavirus, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 is also being considered.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 HCOV-229E virus was first extracted from a sample of nonsoiled patients who had a cold, various coronavirus were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronavirus have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative history of the discovery of human coronavirus in chronological order.
The first HCOV-229E virus was derived from samples from respiratory tracts of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus was subsequently adapted to reproduction in the WI-38 light cell lines.
Patients infected with the HCOV-229E virus had cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general under-harm and pain in the throat, while high temperatures and coughs were observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was released from the organic culture and the subsequent serial massage into the brain of the sausage mice.
The clinical signs of infection with the HCOV-OC43 virus are similar to those of the HCOV-229E virus, whose symptoms are not different from those of other pathogens of respiratory tracts, such as those of influenza type A and rinurus.
Both the HCOV-229E virus and the HCOV-OC43 virus are common in the world and are generally transmitted in winter time in moderate latitudes.
Most of the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of illness.
According to a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCOV-229E virus have developed a simple cold.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity had a severe infection in lower respiratory tracts.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as the "epidemia of atypical pneumonia," was the first well-documented pandemic of human coronavirus in human history in the history of mankind, and the cause of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third known human coronavirus virus.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and continents.
Without the inclusion of superactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could be infected by approximately two more persons; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days; and the peak of the virus load was 10 days.
The patients infected by SARS-CoV initially showed pains in muscles, headaches, high temperatures, general misfortunes and signs, and more recent symptoms included an oscillation, a cough and a respiratory deficiency.
The widespread deviations of laboratory indicators from the SARS standard are lymphpox, liver defects and elevated creatincanase levels.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell exposure and macro-feasurement.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients are subsequently in need of intensive care and mechanical ventilation of lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs may also be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tracts, including iron-cooking organs, liver and kidneys, usually accompanied by a citocinian storm that may be lethal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The virus was first released from open biopsy by a patient's lung relative who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to explore human coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it was mainly affecting young children, older persons and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCOV-NL63 is characterized by signs such as whistling, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolithitis.
Another independent study describes the release of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it is actually common.
It is estimated that HCOV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7 per cent of the widespread respiratory diseases, and the peak of the diseases caused by them is at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with a obstructive laringitate, which is also called a croupe.
HCOV-HKU1 was released in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old male hospitaled with pneumonia and bronchiolithitis.
In addition to extravagant pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCOV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthmatic diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, the HCOV-HKU1 virus causing light-form respiratory diseases was detected worldwide.
All these four human coronavirus, which cause extravagant infections, have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which has led to highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents have been unknown, as in a rare example with a more virulent HCoV-NL63 logo, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infection of lower respiratory tracts in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transfer and maintain in the human body, these human coronavirus become less virulent or pathogenic.
==History==The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a light 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney deficiency.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, import and distribution cases were recorded through sporadic secondary cases of contamination in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also experienced acute kidney failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronavirus that transmit to a person.
More than 30 per cent of patients suffer from stomach symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of high-death Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent) had been recorded, so MERS-CoV was considered to be one of the most deadly viruses known to the human being.
From mid to the end of December 2019, in Uhan of the Chinese province of Hubei, the pneumonia clusters of patients were identified and are now associated with the infection caused by the coronavirus by the severe acute respiratory syndrome of the 2nd type (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-COV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been referred to as the Coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and, beyond it, 1.2 per cent.
SARS-COV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a heavy respiratory infection characterized by rising temperatures, coughs and oscillations.
Some patients are also diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to quickly undergo acute respiratory deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the purple tree.
SARS-COV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater transfer capacity than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
There have been cases of SARS-CoV-2 immunized infection, indicating the potential of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-Cov-2 with the other six human coronavirus reveals important similarities and differences.
First, the human-transmitted coronavirus have a similar incubation period and the duration of the current of the diseases they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus causing extravagant infections (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most common in human coronavirus, which cause extravagant infections, including non-specific manifestations, slight symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, which are common to both human coronavirus, which cause extravagant infections, and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus who cause extravagant infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transfer of SARS-COV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that cause extravagant infections, SARS-COV-2 can be found in cal samples.
We still have to answer the question as to whether SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in certain circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronavirus, which causes extravagant infections.
However, the future development of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-COV-2, including transferability, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after people pass.
All four human coronavirus, which cause extravagant infections with symptoms of light shape, were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, perhaps these people were well adapted to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could be the only survivors of the human coronavirus pandemic in the past.
Human coronavirus, which causes severe diseases in humans, and people whose human coronavirus causes severe diseases, have simply not survived.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must be repelled in the human body to a sufficient extent to generate adaptive mutations that are counterproductive to the limiting factors of the host.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people infected, the greater the chance that the virus is fully adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to people by quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four extravagant coronavirus have been circulating among the population, causing ordinary cold to people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need a reservoir animal.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted to a person well enough, and their transmission to people cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and reproduce in their zooonic tanks and to seek access to sensitive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcements.
SARS-COV-2 has features similar to those of SARS-Cov/MERS-COV and four extravagant HCOV viruses.
It's very easy to transmit as extravagant HCV, at least now.
But he's more pathogen than extravagant HCOV and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to see whether he adapts fully to the human being and whether he circulates in the human environment without a container or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of the HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutional, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and storage media of the HCoV viruses.
Animals serve as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if they carry a close-born ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Precinct virus is usually well adapted and unpathogeneous in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier is constantly transporting HCV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural holders of HCOV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCV was only included in an intermediate medium just before or about the time when it was carried by a person, it was not well adapted to the new medium and often pathogen.
This intermediate medium can serve as a zooonic source of human infection and play the role of a reinforcing medium, allowing the virus to replicaulate lightning and then handing it over to people by increasing the scale of human infection.
HCV may postpone a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission within an intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to intermediate media and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural container carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS patient had contact with hunting animals (discipline) in the anamnese.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that IgG antibodies are more common to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The Himalayan cyvets (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in animal markets have become the first identified vectors of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that since the destruction of all cieves in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cyvets living in nature or on farms and not entering markets had not been determined in most cases by SARS-CoV, thus concluding that the Himalayan cyvets could serve only as an intermediate booster rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that, since 80 per cent of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that multiple forms of small mammals can also be used by intermediate reinforcements.
They all seem to be the dead end of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV identified a close nature coV bat mice, which was called atypical pneumonia by the coronavirus of the subservent bats HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatoCov HKU3) and which is present in Chinese pondow bats.
These mice are positive on the antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronavirus bats have 88-92 per cent of the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats have become bearers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) were also detected in volatile mice, but none of them, except one that refers to WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the receptor of SARS-CoV is the human angiotensin-convertible enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the bat fecals, uses ACE2 bats, cyvets and man as a receptor for entering the cage.
Curiously, the serums of recovering patients from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest parent of SARS-CoV in volatile mice, sharing 95 per cent of the homologology of nucleotic sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV, and bats are not the direct container carrier of SARS-CoV.
Philogenic analysis takes MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats, and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same medium of the medium, diptildiptidasis-4 (DPP4), to inject viruses.
The sequences of the RNC-dependent MERS-CoV polymerase virus are physically closer to the sequences of the beta coronavirus of volatile mice found in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats haven't found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The nucleotic sequence homologies of MERS-COV and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats are only 87 per cent.
So bats may not have been directly carrying the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that single camels are seropositive to neutral antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as to Middle East camels in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was removed from the palate of single camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV storage media.
It should also be noted that camels experimented with MERS-CoV showed slight symptoms, but massive virus exposure.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have not only released the virus by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main way to release the virus from volatile mice.
However, questions still remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome did not have contact with camels in the background prior to the occurrence of symptoms and are rightly related to human transmission or transmission of unknown channels that include unidentified species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide homoology of SARS-Cov-2 is 96.2 per cent consistent with CoV RATG13 bats from the Asian Rhinolopus affinis ponds.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the diffusion of sequences between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too great to attribute to them parental relationships.
So bats may not have been the direct container carrier of SARS-COV-2, unless almost identical bat coronavirus are found in the future.
It is assumed that the direct carriers of the SARS-COV-2 virus should be among the wild species sold and killed in the Uhana wholesale market of seafood, which involved many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating a likely case of animal transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenic sequestering have concluded that a group of threatened to destroy small mammals known as pangolines (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent beta coronavirus, a related SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new coronavirus genes of pangolines is 85-92 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also close to RATG13, with an identity of about 90 per cent at the nucleotic sequence level.
They are clustered in two sublines of the differentiation of viruses like SARS-COV-2 in the philogenetic tree, one of which is closer to SARS-Cov-2 with an identical amino acid sequence of 97.4 per cent.
On the contrary, the RSD of the SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 strains are more divergents, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences in the entire genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the definition of virus contigos in lung samples, which were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a sequence of genomes, comprising about 86.3 per cent of a full-scale viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangoline has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the diffusion of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than between SARS-COV-2 and beta coronavirus pangolines associated with SARS-Cov-2.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established in volatile mice, pangolines and other mammals.
While the highest hemoology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-COV-2 and the beta coronavirus of pangolines, related to SARS-COV-2, the SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 have the highest hemorrhology of sequences throughout the genome.
In theory, the high degree of likeness between the beta coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-Cov-2, and SARS-CoV-2, is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours a recombination between the beta coronavirus of pangolines, related to SARS-COV-2, and RATG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronavirus.
There is still no final decision on the direct zooonic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCOV viruses, the zooonic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from the coronavirus of volatile mice, while the parent viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found at the rodents.
It was reported that the bat coronavirus called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) identified by the North American three-colored pancake showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of volatile mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that his intermediate carrier might have been camel.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The Philogenic Analysis provided evidence of the events of the interspecies transmission of HCOV in the anamnesus.
When there was an interspecies transmission of the HCOV-OC43 virus around 1890, and people became infected by pets, a respiratory pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCOV-229E interspecies is not so clear.
Alphacoronavirus of volatile mice close to HCV-229E were detected.
There's an alphacoronavirus of alpaca between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacas, who were able to communicate with bats in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alpha coronavirus of volatile mice, related to HCOV-229E, in volatile mice are diverse and non-pathogenous, while alphacoronavirus alpaca has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coronavirus alpaca was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the alpha-coronavirus of HCOV-229E is likely to have been acquired from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic human viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nepah virus and the Hendra virus.
It's not surprising, therefore, that bats can be directly transmitted to the people of HCOV-229E.
On the other hand, while the alpha-coronavirus of volatile mice could serve as a gene bullet of the HCOV-229E virus, alpacas and single camels could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies from bats of single camels and from single camels to man.
The evolution of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies of gene fragments and interspecies.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly bats make bats "ideal distributors."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single camels decades ago.
He was well adapted to these camels, which from the intermediate host became a stable and natural container carrier.
These animals have a very easy disease and a relatively low frequency of mutations.
His occasional transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end MERS-CoV carrier because his transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, beta coronavirus pangolines are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be the dead-end carriers of beta coronavirus related to SARS-COV-2, as well as cyvets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies should confirm or exclude several possibilities for interspecies transmission of the SARS-COV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a container carrier for the SARS-COV-2 virus, almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
People can share the ecological niche with bats because of the carbon mining or the splitting of the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolines may be one of the intermediate reinforcements in which the SARS-Cov-2-related virus has recently hit.
People are infected with the virus by cutting carcases and eating wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of home and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 could take place in the third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for animal origin of SARS-Cov-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the part of viruses have also contributed to cross-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in the RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with single-chain RNA, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "measured-high" with an average replacement frequency of approximately 10-4 replacements per year in one section 2 depending on the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to the new owners.
The coronavirus have a corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even not viability.
I wonder if the nucleotoid analog Remdesivir is depressing the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNC-dependent RNC-polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-Cov-2 to be tested in clinical research.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
Moreover, the mutation frequency may often be even higher if the coronavirus are not sufficiently adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-Cov-2 mutations is probably lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus is supposed to have been adapted to another medium close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that vaccines and anti-retroviral drugs from SARS-Cov-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, a large RNC genome in coronavirus leads to greater plastic in genomic modification with regard to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies that are conducive to the emergence of new coronavirus if conditions permit.
This is facilitated by the many unique open reading frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the direction of 3 " end of genome " .
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirus randomly and often switch matrices during the replication of RNCs.
During the transcription of the coronavirus DNA in the host, which serves as a mixing vessel, the threads are often switched.
High-meteorologically comprehensive and subgenomic RNAs can recombin and create new coronavirus.
Philogenic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in coronavirus animals such as SL-Cov and batCoV-HKU9 bat Covice.
The interaction of the virus with respect to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the medium receptor is another key factor important for interspecies transmission.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-species events, of the SARS-CoV recombination.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV and cyvets, SARS-CoV is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to mutations of S protein on the RSD.
In general, the S coronavirus protein is interacting with the cell receptor, and the antibodies response of the host is taking it intensely.
SARS-CoV is amino acids from 318 to 510 on S1 which connects the virus to an angiotensing enzyme 2 (APF2) and its co-receptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus CD can recognize APF2 receptors of different animals, including bats, cyvets, mice and raccoon dogs, making possible inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, different from human viral strains and cyvets, of which 4 are in a receptor-related motive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-Cov cyvets have K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which can increase the relevance of the interaction of the schipovid protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30 per cent between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV in segment S1 protein S leads to a change in the relationship between protein S to human APF2.
Indeed, research using a cryo-electronic microscope says that the relevance of this link is 10-20 times higher than between APF2 and the S squirrel of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other couplings were needed to transfer SARS-COV-2.
It is surprising that HCV-NL63 is also linked to APF2 but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as the N aminopepticsis for HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetyltic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans following interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies of the HCoV transmission is also controlled by other factors of dependence and restriction of the medium.
The diffusion of these proteins between humans and natural HCOVs, such as bats, single camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful inter-species transmission of HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and to subordinate the factors of the vector restructation.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
An impartial full-scale screening of the dependency factors and restructuring of the SARS-COV-2 media can produce good results through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCV: Back to zero
The diversity of coronavirus bats provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCVs.
In this sense, the coronavirus of bats serve as a genetic bullet for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coded genes has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.
Of the SARS-CoV accessor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, since the bat viruses of SARS-CoV-related bats have been isolated, but it has been established that they code the ORF8 divergent proteins.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide division characterized by SARS-CoV coronavirus was detected.
This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with lines of alpha- and gamma-coronavirus, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNC-dependent RNC-polimeraz.
Localization of the recombination was also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic had been subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which had occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs, where HCoV recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in virus genomes, which are likely to result from the release of the virus from selective pressures, such as the immune system of the host.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in the prototype HCOV-229E by a double-nucleotide division.
While the intuitive open ORF4 reading box can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCOV-229E, the alpha coronavirus of the alpaca display a single nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCV is also due to the pressure of sampling on their storage media.
When infected with bats, the symptoms were poorly expressed or absent, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and volatile mice.
It turns out that bats are anatomical and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of the provocative response from volatile mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by the coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of the killer cells in the bats is depressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor of the natural cell killer NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expressivity of the molecules of the main hystocompatibility complex of Class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is ensured by the high metabolic activity of volatile mice, can suppress the replication of coronavirus while simultaneously influencing the exoribonuclease reading, thus creating a sampling pressure for the generation of virus strains that are highly pathogenic when entering the new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in new proteins or protein properties to adapt the host.
Thus, it is not an accident that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the past 20 years.
The coronavirus are not pathogenic or cause slight symptoms in their storage media, such as bats or camels.
They are firmly replicated without causing a strong immune response to the host.
That is the secret of why we see immature media, and what causes serious human infections.
The severe symptoms are mainly related to the hyperactivity of immune response and citocinous storm, where the greater immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, immunized media do not have a replication of coronavirus.
The same policy of non-linking immune response can have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-Cov-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the acceptance of the I-type interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-Cov-2 infection, should be beneficial to people.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammasoma activation was disrupted by volatile mice.
On this basis, the inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasomas using MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The formation of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern under which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While beta coronavirus of volatile mice was found, the nucleotide homoology of which is 95 per cent consistent with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of volatile mice, whose nucleotide homoology matches 96 per cent with SARS-Cov-2.
Although it was found that cyvets and other animals in markets were transporting viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-Cov-2 were not installed.
The beta coronavirus of the pangolin were discovered, the amazing homological SARS-COV-2, which suggests that pangolines could serve as an intermediate medium or that fragments of pangoline beta coronavirus genes could be included in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by a person.
The coronavirus have received universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in volatile mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zooonic origin and HCOV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
The convincing evidence showed that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 originated from volatile mice and were handed over to a person through intermediate media.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and cyvets in markets, the closure of the markets of the wild and the destruction of cyt could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of pangoline beta coronavirus lines close to SARS-CoV-2, the pagolines should be removed to prevent zooonic transmission from product markets.
However, whether SARS-COV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolines and other mammals, and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in single camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov and SARS-COV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
As we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks of disease can emerge.
The world is circulating a variety of zooonic coronavirus.
In particular, the coronavirus of volatile mice with zooonic potential is extremely diverse.
There is a great deal of opportunity for the evolution and recombination of these zoonosic coronavirus, which in the future will lead to the creation of new coronavirus, which is easier to transmit and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new areas can be seized.
While many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses by teaching people to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized.
A better understanding of the ecology of coronavirus and their natural media requires constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronavirus to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of zooonic viruses.
SARS-COV-2 is still lacking in the zooonic puzzle.
First, if bats were handed over to the SARS-Cov-2 pagolines, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolines share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to a person, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate medium is to be played by a third mammal, it must be determined how it interacts with different species, including humans, volatile mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-COV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, pangoline or other mammals, it's expected that in the future SARS-COV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural media.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution of SARS-COV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspectations of disease" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief reference manual on diagnostics and treatment of the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and recommendations for combating the pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and set out the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspecting the disease" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the "Recommendations on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19" (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the CR.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as the coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), was launched, and the virus itself was called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-Cov-2 infection, our group developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The publication attracted great attention.
At the same time, we note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the "Recommendations on diagnostics and therapy for COVID-19" published by the National Health Committee of the CR (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were issued, with some of its provisions changing substantially.
Recently, the work prepared by Zhou with the co-sponsors has provided comments on our recommendations, which contain simple diagnostic proposals based on the clinical experience already available.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has also provided valuable background information on the pandemic that has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the "Recommendations on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19" (test seventh version) and ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (March 3, 2020), one element of epidemiological history with two clinical symptoms of disease must be combined to carry out a comprehensive analysis when confirming a suspected disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movement or residence in and around Uhany or other locations where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded for 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-COV-2 (positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its environs or from other locations where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded in two weeks at small sites such as home or apartment, office, class at school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external exposures to COVID-19; (3) the total number of leukocites is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocites at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed disease should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogenic or surological evidence, namely: (1) real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-COV-2; (2) full-scale sequesteration of the virus shows a high homogenicity of the new coronavirus; (3) positive results of the serotest for the specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the result of the test with a negative positive effect for the SARS-Cov-2 antibodies IgG, or an increase of the tittra at least four times on the recovery phase relative to the corresponding acute phase indicator.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020), a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in respiratory or blood samples was added.
The pathogenic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) releases; and then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers seeking an optimum set for the detection of nucleic acid in rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and promotes the inclusion of positive results of tests for specific antibodies in the disease validation criteria.
However, there is growing evidence of the need to exercise caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou ' s work, and others, should be updated as it classified persons with no clinical symptoms as a "low-risk" group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification of further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to keep their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspects of disease" and "confirmed cases," we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19 - day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths resulting from COVID-19 per day.
That's the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiological, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases of infection were reported, as well as 33 healing patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
On-line Brifingue, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjaby Sabrina Flora, told that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjaby, two died over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one died between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadolu that one of the victims was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, Director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was in treatment at the Kuwait clinic in Maitri.
On Saturday, on an online video, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Kwader, stated that public transport would be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped on 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - has still been authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March with two persons who had returned from Italy, as well as one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-COV-2 has crossed the millions of infections worldwide.
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-Cov-2 across the world exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people died from COVID-19 coronavirus.
The Congo came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first case of infection and Zambia recorded the first death from coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which there was no sign of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of contamination, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 in central-European time (800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded in the United States, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, with reference to Johns Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection were recorded on Wednesday in the United States.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobite, extended the regime of self-isolation of citizens of the city until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-exemptation, would receive wages until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the curfew has previously lasted only from 3 hours to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce curfews from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home-based self-isolation regime had been extended by order until 1 May.
Australian shops limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australia's Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased once in all the country's shops to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cash announcements as well as on the Facebook page.
Citizens reportedly started to make emergency stocks because of insurance that COVID-19 could lead to a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the number of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles trading network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the imposition of a restriction on four packages, "in many shops, toilet paper is still being bought too quickly - one supply within an hour," and called such demand "predictable," while ALDI in the Facebook post published on Tuesday called such a trend "unexpected."
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The Costco shop in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.
In order to fill the deficit, Coles started ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increasing the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale by Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australia Rhythiers Association, reported that the rhythmiers were trying to replenish the stock, but that was hampered by restrictions on the travel schedule of trucks by local authorities.
He expected a rise in the cost of products, as suppliers were trying to meet demand, but less and less favourable offers were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, owing to the depletion of stocks, some shops could not take stock of the environment.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said that stores were replenishing stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper was bulky, so the quantity of storage stocks was small and, after the sale of the entire product, long series remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stock.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelf could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelfs in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn't panic like that," says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing products of the Sorbent brand, reported that they worked 24 hours a day to ensure sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the absence of buyers during the week of the Labour Day, some real estate sellers began to offer free toilet paper to the first auctioners.
The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefited from increased demand, including medical masks, hand-defecting, galanteria, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the online store of the British Ocado supermarket also restricted the sale of Andres' toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
Although the term "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to:
"All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate sick people, track cases and mobilize their citizens," explained by Mr. Tedros Adana Guebreisus, Director General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "predictable."
He said in an interview on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus except flu has yet to be traced from its inception to its continuous global spread."
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international importance and then assumed its new status as a pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Faci, said it was a flash: "It's just the beginning, it's gonna be worse."
According to Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, more than 4,600 people died.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 is the currently present coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus by heavy acute respiratory syndrome -2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Ouhana, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an international public health emergency was declared, which was later recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been recorded in 210 countries and regions, resulting in the deaths of some 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughs, and impaired breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distraught syndrome.
The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive: recommended preventive measures include handwashing, plating in coughs, maintaining distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities worldwide responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure.
The pandemic has led to serious global social and economic consequences, the postponement or abolition of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread shortage of products exacerbated by panic.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
Disinformation on the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who resemble them, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there are significant incidences of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as a result of reduced travel and closure of heavy industries.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Huhan (Hubei capital), China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation of the situation was initiated in early January 2020.
The incidences were mainly related to the wholesale market of Juanan seafood, so the virus is believed to be of zooonic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. This is recently an open virus with a great deal of similarities with the coronavirus of the bat, the coronavirus of the pangolin and the SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease had arisen on 1 December 2019, and that it had not visited the market since that date.
Two thirds of the cases recorded in December 2019 related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in a publication by the South China branch of the newspaper Morning Post, which had not been verified, it was suggested that the first case of contamination had occurred with a 55-year-old resident in Hobei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had decreased but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly understated, in particular because of the many cases with low symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection had been recorded among young people, with patients aged 19 years and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the United Kingdom's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Wallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before the establishment of effective group immunity in the country's population.
Statistics include cases of contamination of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on 16 March showed that up to 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China and that such unregistered patients had become a source of contamination for 79 per cent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the incidence of actual contamination in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to be 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients are well recovered.
In other more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, and the most frequent period was 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not account for dead people who have not been tested - for example, in the case of death in their home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Italy ' s incomplete data indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID rate by 4 to 5 times.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) press secretary acknowledges: "We know that [the reported number of deaths] is lower than actual" and his words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the US, which is often recorded in pandemics such as the H1N1 epidemic, the first confirmed death in Huhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents, except Antarctica, had reported deaths, and several methods were commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease; they are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The mortality/prevalence ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases during the time interval.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the ratio of mortality to morbidity decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of the percentage of deaths due to illness (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of deaths from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to the University of Oxford Evidence Centre, the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper number of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO argues that the current pandemic can be monitored.
Pick and exact flash-point cannot be defined and may vary according to location.
Maceia Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to go to the platoon and then, when the number of infected patients ends, they begin to disappear.
In the current situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable projection as to when this occurs."
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Jun Nanshan, states that "all can end by June" if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-COV-2 "will circulate, possibly within a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is established, physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, a member of Vanderbilt University, says, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it's so easy to transfer," and that he's "may turn into a seasonal disease, blowing up every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can endure the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperatures (88%) and dry coughs (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetness in breathing routes (slime), loss of smell, oscillation, pain in muscles and joints, pain in throats, headaches, platoons, vomiting, bloodharcaniers, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims that it is seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems for approximately six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list immediate symptoms such as breathing difficulties, constant pains or feelings of bruising in the chest, sudden sense of confusion, difficulty in awakening and inflining a person or a lip. If these symptoms exist, medical attention should be sought immediately. The further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distraught syndrome, sepsis, septical shock and death.
Some infected people may have a disease without any clinical evidence, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend that persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis has been confirmed be placed under strict control and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the incidence of immature currents varies from several to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. Until there is complete clarity on the symptoms of the loss of smell: the initial estimates indicate that the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was initially 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as by small drops emitted into the air with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some open-cough studies, drops can spread between 4.5 metres (15 feet) and 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops thrown into the air during a conversation that can stay in the air for longer periods; respiratory drops can also be formed at a breath, including during a conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
Capleys can get in the mouth or nose of people around them, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (RHR), may lead to the dispersal of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, with subsequent contact with his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus may be transmitted through fecalia, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies that SARS-CoV-2 can be distributed. The virus is most infected within the first three days of the symptoms, although its spread may occur both before symptoms occur and at later stages of the disease.
There were instances where tests were positive in testing three days before symptoms were introduced, and this indicates the possibility of transmission of the virus prior to the expression of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of immunized disease currents, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from non-symptomic carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually affects two to three other people. The virus can survive on surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus could live for up to three days, on the map surface for one day, and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with a positive result of COVID-19 for households and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities advise them to wash their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new virus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases recorded in Huhan.
All signs of the new SARS-Cov-2 virus are found in nature in the native coronavirus, and in the face of the human body, the virus can be destroyed by a domestic soap that dissolves its protective skin.
It is assumed that it has a zooonic origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically clustered with Betacoronavirus, a species of Sarbecovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of bat virus.
At a holistic-genomic level, it is 96 per cent identical to other models of batic coronavirus (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the sequences of the genome of pangoline and human viruses.
A holistic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarities (92 per cent) exist between the pangolin coronavirus and the SARS-COV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate owners of the virus.
The virus may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by analysing a polymerized chain response with a reverse transcript (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Ouhana showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease current processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiation has issued a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics."
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-COV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time climate chain response test (RT-PCD) is being carried out.
It can be carried out on breathing samples and blood samples.
The results are usually available within a period of several hours to a few days.
The test usually uses nozzles, although there may also be lubricant from zeva. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to obtain approval for universal application.
In the U.S., the Cellex serological test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral mutations of the type of bat glass and the absence of pleurate.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for developing an international database of confirmed cases of contamination.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirrus, COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical characteristics.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the results of the chest CT and the testing of the PCR, and it was clarified that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in the contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus through X-rays and computer-based tomography, the development of span neural networks based on artificial intelligence has been developed.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining common personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using napkins in coughs or sneezing, which should be dropped immediately after use.
Those who may have already been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated, and many Governments recommend that they refrain from any short-term visits to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and limit the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is being disseminated among the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected; health workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and eye protection, and surveillance is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (AI), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements to limit this type of human surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been developed and proposed for voluntary use; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked to develop solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as the recording of user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he received a notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, the nose and mouth strip, which is actually ineffective.
So far, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after a toilet visit or heavy hand pollution, as well as before food, after freezing, coughing or sniffling.
This is necessary because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens up its protective cover.
Furthermore, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat hands on alcohol with at least 60 per cent alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be defected by a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface begins to operate a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen transoxide and 0.2-7.5% yod.
Other components, such as benzalconia chloride and chlorexine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an institution, such as an office or a day-care facility, all the space of the facility, including rooms, toilets, public premises, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend, in coughing or sneaking, that the mouth and nose of the elbow or napkin should be covered and that the hygiene items used should be dumped immediately.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks because the use of masks may limit the volume and range of the exposure of the excess products that are dispersed in the air when talking, chishing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist from the University of Leeds, "the use of medical masks can reduce people's inclination to touch their face, and the touch to the face with dirty hands is the main way of infection." The masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of touch to the face.
Several countries have started calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, USA, recommend wearing non-medical tissue masks, China specifically stressed the importance of using one-off medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Thailand's health officials call on people to make and clean their personal tissues at home every day.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the streets without masks closing their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Vietnamese Government requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has pledged to all visitors to the grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks have been produced per day since mid-March, it was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask while entering the street; people who could not buy masks had been advised to wear them on their own in domestic conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, jobs, stadiums, theatres and trade centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding people's places, using endless greetings and physically moving away from others.
Many Governments in regions, especially those affected by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by U.S. government and health organizations, has been reduced rapidly, from 250 (in regions where no COVID-19 data was available) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited gathering in groups of more than two persons: older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system were at increased risk of contracting the virus in serious form. CDC recommended that they remain at home as long as possible if there was an outbreak in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance" thus clarifying the purpose of the measure of reducing physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term "social distance" was understood to mean that people should be completely excluded rather than being in contact with other people in alternative ways; some agencies had published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations have been made to engage only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are confident that he has no virus or symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for home-based self-imsolation.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be quarantined themselves.
High-risk individuals have been ordered by a strict quarantine system.
Persons who may have been in contact with the infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region that is heavily affected by the epidemic were encouraged to quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is designed to track and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
The outbreak of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the epidemic's peak known as the levelling of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Non-pharmaceic interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include measures of personal prevention, such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-imsolvation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and removal of mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as cleaning up surfaces; and after China ' s severity of the outbreak has become apparent, more decisive action has been taken to contain outbreaks, such as isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, and a system of warning of the movement of infected persons was organized.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected persons on self-isolation and heavy fines were imposed on those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has increased and fines have been imposed for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines. The British and U.S. model has shown that there are serious problems with mitigating (delaying but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (stopping the epidemic).
An optimal policy to mitigate the impact of the disease can reduce the health system ' s peak by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
The vaccination may be the preferred method, but it needs to be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-retroviral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
The adoption of non-receptive cold drugs, drinking enough fluids and rest can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, injecting fluid and breathing support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment of other virus diseases are also considered for use in COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and domestic funds" could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-Cov-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and the adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for primary health-care clinics and services to facilitate the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-emergency procedures, where possible, for the detection of virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the enhancement of intensive therapy through training of staff and the increase in the availability of IWL and coke devices.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection - the so-called "zero patient" - might have occurred.
The first known case of contamination of a new coronavirus infection was likely to take place on 1 December 2019 in the town of Huhan Province of Hubay, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus in Hobei province has increased gradually over the month.
Most of these were related to the Huane Seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories was that the virus had infiltrated the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zooonic origin. On 26 December, a case of widespread pneumonia of unknown origin was recorded at the Hubei clinic, with which Dr. Zhang Tianjin had been working, reporting the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the town of Uhan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the central hospital in Uhan warned their colleagues about "a coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and a doctor, Ai Feng, received a reprimand from his superiors for raising panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhana Municipal Health Commission published a public notification and informed WHO about the situation.
Uhana health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was sufficiently large to initiate an investigation early in January; at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, facilitated by the Chinese New Year ' s Holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections per day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already experienced symptoms; as of 26 March, the United States had stolen China and Italy from the largest number of confirmed cases worldwide; as of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of contamination.
Owing to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted their free movement and have established border controls.
National responses included measures to control the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay of home, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As at 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people were isolated in the Philippines, some 59 million were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were isolated in some form, and two days later this figure rose to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world ' s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Ouhana on 1 December 2019; another report, whose credibility was not verified, indicated that the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jisyan worked with an unknown type of pneumonia case, which was notified on 27 December by her clinic to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Uhan.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, revealed the presence of SARS as a coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Uhana Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such reports, the police alerted doctors in Ouhana to the responsibility for "smart spreading" of the outbreak.
Initially, the National Health Commission of China argued that there was no "clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transfer from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later named Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, "People's War."
The events of the "most large-scale quarantine in the history of mankind" were unfolding, on 23 January, a health cordon was announced and a ban on entry into and back to Uhan was later extended to a total of 15 towns in Hobay province, affecting a total of some 57 million people.
The use of personal transport was banned in the city.
In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) have been cancelled.
The authorities have also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Khuoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients, was subsequently built.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also reassigned 14 other institutions in Ouhana, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools have been closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside Hubei province.
The schedule for public transport has been changed and museums have been temporarily closed throughout China.
In many cities, the movement control regime was introduced and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) had experienced some form of restrictions on movement in the open air, after the outbreak had entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one case of intra-country transmission had been registered on mainland China, five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister, Lee Kejiang, reported that the spread of intra-country transmissions was largely stopped and China's outbreak was controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei other than Uhana were lifted, two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provide companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute "minute silence" was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus announced by the National Council of State and coincided with the Queenmin holiday, but the central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online, while respecting physical distance to avoid the re-emergence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, which were largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
The followers of Shincheonji arrived in Tagu from Ouhanya, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and on 29 February this figure has increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers had confirmed the existence of the virus.
The outbreak affected the number of travels, hence the flight schedule of airlines has been changed, and South Korea has launched a programme to screen the population on the availability of the virus, to monitor contacts and to provide quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best organization in the world.
The screening methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through a mobile application by all those coming from abroad, a head test for the virus, the results of which were ready for the following day, as well as increased testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea ' s programme is considered to have been successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that cities have not been isolated there; initially, South Korean society was divided by President Moon Jae-in ' s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea recorded the lowest total number of cases per day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that since 1 April all newly arrived from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April, 121 countries sought assistance in testing the virus in South Korea.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict inter-urban travel, but the intensive movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the centre of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealing the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had linked their disease to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak there could be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members reported to have been positive on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called upon the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent and to release temporarily all prisoners suitable for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths per day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronavirus had been recorded every hour in Iran and one new death from coronavirus every 10 minutes.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence rate in Iran could be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the mitigation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease fell into Italy when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome had a positive result.
The incidence of contamination has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 infections was later discovered, beginning with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lomé on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté said: "The entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be closed.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend business and cancel sports activities." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy at that time.
All major sporting events, including the A series football matches, were to be held in private until April, but all sports events were postponed for at least one month on 9 March.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conté ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Rehabilitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics with regard to the medical priority protocols that may have to be used.
On 19 March, Italy beat China by the death rate from coronavirus, taking the first place in the world, after declaring 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus contamination in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
One CNN report notes that this high mortality rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors - the large number of older citizens in that country and the lack of opportunity to examine all those who are now sick of coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus in the calmest of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020 the British Government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not responding quickly and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that he refrain from all visits and social contacts that were not of primary importance, inviting people to work from home and to avoid public places, such as pubs, restaurants and theatres, wherever possible.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than Pound2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures for social distance, prohibiting the collection of more than two persons and limiting travel and active rest in the air only in cases of extreme need.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed with the involvement of the police, the imposition of fines and the looting of populations.
Most of the enterprises were ordered to close, except for enterprises that provide "people's lives," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, fuel stations and garages.

Despite this, the testing of the population in the United States was not initiated immediately, and as a result, the true scale of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, by the absence of a federal government authorization to use non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done on the basis of the appointment of a visiting doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been carried out by 13 March.

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and control the spread of infection.
WHO noted the apparent differences between the situation with the outbreak of an atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, during which Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the spread of the disease on the one hand, and the current crisis, where the central Government "regularly provided updated information on the situation to avoid panic in the eve of the New Year of China."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Ouhana, the representative of WHO, Goden Galea, noted that although "this measure was clearly recommended by WHO," it was also "very important to demonstrate compliance with the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most widespread location" and called it "predicted in public health history." On 30 January, after confirmation of the ability to transmit infection from human beings outside China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries, WHO declared a public health emergency of international importance (PHEIC); this situation was the sixth since 2009, when it was first applied during a pig influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the announcement of PHEIC was due to "the emerging global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement."
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to provide $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need for urgent assistance to those countries that "have no systems to identify those infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries."
Mr. Tedros also stated that "a demonstration of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for our weakest epidemic," and called on the international community to "make a choice: investing today or paying in the future" at a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire United Nations system in response to the problem."
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, as WHO states, will enable "to focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to cope with the outbreak of the disease in a broader social and economic context."
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to help address the situation within the country and assess the "seriousness of the disease and its disease," organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits, to assess "the effectiveness of response measures at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that "while it is too early to call the pandemic, countries should nevertheless be ready to do so."
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus proliferation would be increased from "high" to "very high" - the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet ready for reality: time to proceed.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready, and also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the worst scenario of events.
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify the declaration of the global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the declaration of the pandemic would mean that "we actually recognize the fact that everyone on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus."
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of the pandemic ' s coronavirus.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO "is deeply concerned about both the alarming high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in this regard." WHO is seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the situation, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, Director-General of WHO, was requested to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 persons on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to use life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, refugees and other unidentified groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The digital hub contains information on country-level policy measures (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gouva and Eduardo Bolsonru, son of President Jaira Bolsonru of Brazil, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubay.
A number of provincial leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have shown dissatisfaction with the response of the political reconciliation to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus had begun in Huhan, but took sides in the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had arisen in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump's administration called the "Chinese virus" or "Uhana virus" coronavirus, stating that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and "discussed from the failure of the US President's administration to control the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast has access to the US government telegram, which contains a communication strategic trick, apparently invented by the National Security Council, and there are such references to the strategy: "It's all about China.
We are requested to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television speeches, such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, which stated that China ' s efforts to help countries affected by the virus were part of the "advocacy" to gain global influence.
The Head of the EU Foreign Policy Department, Josép Borrell, warned of the presence of a "geopolitic component that includes the struggle for influence through piara and so-called generosity policies."
Borrell also stated that "China is actively promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the US."
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and some reports suggest sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by the U.S. sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of transferring assistance for other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy, also had disputes with regard to medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has assigned hundreds of IWL vehicles to Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union in respect of the Crown of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that "China alone responded bilaterally.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the dispatch to Italy of Russian military nurses, specialized de-infection transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous high-level political source that claimed that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "unhelpful or little useful for Italy."
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression of world public opinion at the "geopolitan and diplomatic" level.
President Lombardia Attilio Fontana and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy Luigi Di Mayo rejected media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
The Press Secretary of the Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov, stated that "in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rates, they will also be able to provide response when necessary."
NATO Defense 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries - NATO ' s largest military exercises after the end of the cold war - will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise (Defender 2020) ": "In the current public health crisis, these exercises threaten the lives not only of the US military and many European participating countries, but also of the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be conducted." The Iranian Government has been severely affected by the virus, with some two dozen members of Parliament and fifteen other current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for assistance, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in dealing with the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic has generated calls for the United States to adopt social policies that are common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single health and childcare system, paid family leave and increased funding for public health care.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election at the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic has led to a deterioration in diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "unmarked and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine facility in specially designated locations by the Government.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President's actions or called for Mr. Moon's impeachment for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban an indefinite right to govern by decree, suspend the work of Parliament, and conduct elections and punish those accused of spreading faecal information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus was cited as the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of products in panic and the disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Food and Drug Quality Control issued warnings of shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in the performance of suppliers.
Several locations also had panic purchases; this had led to the loss of essential goods, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, which in turn resulted in a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protection has increased 100 times.
This leap has resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It had also caused a lack of personal protection worldwide, and WHO had warned that health workers would therefore be under attack.
In Australia, in response to the pandemic, the buyers of the Daigou system were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have resulted in a shortage of child nutrition in some supermarkets and have subsequently been banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, in both areas it has been possible to avoid severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade in critical products that had been successful had avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe, as well as in North America.
North Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but industry believes that agricultural production prices can rise.
The food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Ouhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to ensure full nutrition for the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to maintain food stocks in case of emergency also exist in Italy.
The damage to the world economy has affected China: According to media reports of 16 March, China ' s economy was severely affected during the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, resulting in a decline of 20.5 per cent in retail sales.
The mainland China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, it is believed that the virus outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agatha Demarai, an Economist Intelligence Unit, market volatility is expected to continue until there is a clearer picture of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed the impact of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
One assessment made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis suggests that the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and negative impacts could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take urgent measures following a sharp decline in oil prices due to the fall in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears about the outbreak of coronavirus, various United States stock indices, including NASAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Doo-Jones share index, showed the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Doe index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day drop following the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The stocks fell again because of fears about the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
The Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in relation to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights owing to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative influence on cruise industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Cun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
A number of events involving a large number of people were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year ' s Festivals; private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the new year ' s events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent large numbers of people; for example, the Ban City had been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and districts of China, the authorities extended the new year ' s holidays until 10 February, directing most enterprises not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared a state of emergency, closed the school until March and cancelled the New Year ' s celebration, and the retail trade sector was hit globally: the shops ' working hours were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retails in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the attendance of trade centres fell by 33-43 per cent compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of visitors ' temperature test equipment and cancellation of activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave 14 to 22 million more people behind the poverty line than it would have been in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China in the midst of the Ouhana epidemic.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves in their country's provinces or locked up in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought assistance from the Government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, an outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent. The self-isolation measures introduced in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who received daily payments. The study carried out by the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost jobs since the introduction of severe isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers sought a single social benefit; almost half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a Government-subsidized reduced part-time work schedule.
The German part-time pay scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The arts and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic, which affected organizations and individuals, whether formal or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have sought to support their (often publicly funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, and, where possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed around the world indefinitely, or access to them had been limited to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, extensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and emerging phenomenon of the spread of the virus - the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican also declared that the events of the Old Week in Rome, which were held in the last week of Christian repentance, the Great Post, had been cancelled.
Many eparchies encourage older Christians to stay at home and do not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders have been encouraged to perform outdoor service.
Rome ' s Roman Catholic diocese closed to visit its churches, chapel and St. Peter ' s area, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also abolished worship and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourds.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the Crown and the holy sites were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited access by foreign pilgrims and its own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the Seanavirus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "replaced beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021." The casinos and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and the poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast live, were either moved or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players moving online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and entertainment industry has also been affected because various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offshore activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing its results on the Internet, to organize live live live live live online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative occupations to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There are many web-based images on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smoothing the anxiety that characterizes periods of uncertainty.
Since the inception of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as members of the population of hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February news reports (when most cases of infection were still limited by China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received a fair retaliatory for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased.
Many people in Huhana and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China ' s citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported in both offline and online settings.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to face the severe outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition at an early stage, insisting that Chinese citizens should not enter their country to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, hehteg #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#Chinas of the Non-Arriture of Japan) held leading positions on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for what he called the "Chinese virus" coronavirus; critics consider this to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Ouhana to New Sanjara.
Students coming from bordering China in north-eastern India and studying in large cities in India reported cases of persecution associated with the outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatia Janata Party, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and thus "God avenged them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them "dispute," and in China, xenophobia and racism against non-China citizens reappeared due to the pandemic: foreigners began to call "foreign debris" and "outcome" objects.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have posted their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus into public access.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on the pre-printing servers, such as bioRxiv.
The spread of infectious disease is an infectious disease from a returning pathogen whose range or mode of transmission is often unknown.

The smuggling of wild animals and animal-borne diseases are health risks associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-COV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies that are produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the PCR, which recognizes the crownavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only for the detection of the SARS-COV-2 virus by the RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control purposes.
Antibodies tests reveal the number of people who have suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat them at the hospital or not at all.
The exact mortality rate from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by such a test.
As of March 2020, owing to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very controversial.
These differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
By means of a polymerized feedback chain reaction, the test can be carried out in real-time (rRT-PCR) on samples from respiratory tracts obtained in various ways, including nozzle oil or wet sample.
The results are usually available within a period of several hours to two days.
The O-PCR test carried out on lubricants taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, still continuing to reproduce in the lungs.
In the case of infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, materials from lower respiratory tracts may be taken as an alternative by sucking a catheter, or the use of predatory (mocroto) products may be used.
One of the early tests of the PCR was developed at the Charita clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerized feedback chain with a real-time reverse transcript (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR clinical level (PoyerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the "E" gene common to all beta-Conavirus and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-COV-2. China's company BGI Group was one of the first companies to be authorized by China's National Drug Administration to use the SARS-CoV-2 emergency detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel for real-time RRT-PCR (2019-Nvel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panels in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test set produced incomplete results due to married reagents and a narrow test area performed by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Quality Supervision Authority as part of an emergency application permit. US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCD throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing for COVID-19 across the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations were stated; the sampling and processing of analyses should be performed in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Vierology and Biotechnology of VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service and it was reported that on 12 March 2020 the Mayo clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be carried out for 3.5 hours for a large amount of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to perform the Abbott m2000 tests; previously, the FDA issued such authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a duration test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses amplification of insulated nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of variable temperatures, this method can identify positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently some 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day, and Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibodies test that is specific to nucleocapsid protein (N-Belcom) of a new coronavirus, and there is hope that results can be obtained in 15 to 20 minutes, such as express resistance to influenza.
A survey of specialized literature in March 2020 concluded that "the pentgenograms of the chest have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, whereas the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur."
Typical signs identified during the CT include bilateral long-range sub-polarization tricks by type of "match glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterial distribution.
Sub-operative domination, the symptom of a brilliable bridge and consolidation are evolving as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Huhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincided with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a method of testing the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics." As of March 2020, the initial screening CDC recommended using the PCR method.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. The analyses can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by local diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-capacity automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one sample of blood is usually produced by skin cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection phase is not required for testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and are now able to extend their antibodies tests.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency clearance test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test kits, which can be detected in the blood samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of controlling the virus.
The test activity is several hundred samples over a few hours and therefore works much faster than the regular PCR analysis of the viral RNC.
Antibodies can normally be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, Britain discovered that none of its antibodies analysis kits were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of having to stay at home: "Emergency offices pass a sample test on the patient," the patient spit back and receives the results of the test some time later. The British NHS announced the launch of its home-based suspect testing scheme, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient of other hospital visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if used for the patient's transport. During the express test at COVID-19, the medical officer takes the analysis using all appropriate precautions.
The express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that it was ready to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they could do only 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is assigned by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koh of the Institute, Germany ' s overall test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it was proposed that express testing be carried out in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the calendar week, 12/2020 SARS-COV-2 received a total of at least 483,295 tests, up to the week 12/2020 inclusive, and 33,491 models (6.9 per cent) were positive. Researchers at the Israeli clinics Technion and Ramamba Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Huhan on 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory of 2,000 m2 square metres to detect emergency cases called "Hoo-Yan" (in Chinese CLOUT or "Light Eye") that could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jiang and completed in only five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation in such an accelerated pace, there would have been 47 per cent more cases of Hubea disease, and therefore quarantine costs would have also been twice higher.
The Huo-Yang laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened after the opening of the Huo-Yang laboratory, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day and open multi-plicating schemes of the Originami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19, using only 93 test pieces. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, owing to the lack and insufficient number of reagents, massive testing in the EU, Britain and the United States has become problematic.
As a result, some authors applied to test sample processing protocols, which provide for heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for five minutes to release RNC genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the per capita testing by the United Arab Emirates was now higher than any other country and that most of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to rapid testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of a mass testing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yang emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, which has been deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RRT tests per day and is the world ' s first laboratory of such a large scale outside China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of testing kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in a lack of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient numbers of sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts argue that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increasing demand for testing from the rapid spread of the virus, many private U.S. laboratories in which hundreds of thousands of samples were produced were overloaded and supplies for lubricating oil and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The U.S. CDC test kits had "advantages" and therefore the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the cause of the inaccuracies of the results could be a failed sampling or incorrect use of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would call off the low-performance kits and replace them with other sets - the Shenzhen Bioeasy series. Eighty per cent of the tests that Czechs acquired in China had produced had been incorrect. 1.2 million test kits acquired by Slovakia in China had also been found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that they should be dropped into the Danube. Atesh Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had a "high level of error" and the Ministry "not to use them." Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but was declared unfit for use in early April 2020.
Quarantine measures for those whose tests have yielded positive results on SARS-COV-2, as well as monitoring of the people contacted by such patients, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where COVID-19 died for the first time in Italy, conducted two testing cycles for a total population of about 3,400, at about 10 days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
Entry into the municipality was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and shops did not have to be imposed.
Many of the events were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries had been able to identify more patients with low symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, forward their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 WHO monitoring laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The next graph of the column "% of positive results" depends on the country-specific testing policy.
A country where only hospital patients are tested will have a higher positive impact as a percentage compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other conditions of equality.
Handwashing, also known as "hand hygiene," is a process of hand-cleaning to remove pollution, fat, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
The regular washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal or oral way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or ordinary cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., slim eyeballs) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands with soap should be washed: before and after defecation, after the baby's venoming or diapers change, before feeding the child, before food, before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash, and the World Health Organization recommends that hands be washed:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the bathroom.
After snotting, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Hand-hygienic hygiene refers to hygiene related to medical procedures.
The washing of hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clear hands from pathogens (battery, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces respiratory infections,
and reduce infant mortality in domestic childbirth.
The 2013 study showed that better hand washing could lead to a small acceleration of the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by learning simple habits such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the use of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea can be attributed to washing hands with soap, and washing hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARHs) provided that appropriate habits are developed in every house, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the main cause of under-five mortality, which takes the lives of approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Nearly 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap in front of food and after a toilet that has become a solid habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The washing of hands also prevents the occurrence of impetigo - a disease that is transmitted with direct physical contact.
A slight negative consequence of a frequent washing of hands is that it can cause skin drying, and, by the way, damage.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too frequent handwashing could lead to skin cruising and skin scheming - a disease known as ecema or hand-dematitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often handwashing can also be considered a symptom of sedentary-compulsive disorder (CSR).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important in order to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after discharge (defectation, defecation), after washing the baby's berries (replacement of diapers), before feeding the child, before receiving food and before/or after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of cuts or wounds, after sneezing, coughing or freezing, after contacting animal wastes or animals, after contacting garbage.
In many countries, the process of washing hands with soap is quite limited.
A study on handwashing conducted in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families with soap were common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, had been recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US was closer to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest rate was recorded in China, 23 per cent; and there were several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing of hands at school hours was one of those methodologies that helped to teach children to do so.
The emergency health care programme implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of a large-scale effort to improve child health and education.
This national programme is based on degelmintization, which takes place twice a year, as well as the daily washing of hands with soap and the daily cleaning of fluorine teeth.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or cleaning are added during the process of washing.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, as fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the clean-up process.
Solid soap, because of its multiple use, can also contain bacteria that can be affected by previous use.
A small number of studies on the fall on the skin cover of bacteria with a contaminated piece of solid soap indicate that there is little likelihood of such a fall because bacteria are laughing with the foam.
The CDC still claims that "a liquid soap with a manual dosor is the preferred option for washing hands."
Anti-bakterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial agents such as triclosan, to which there are many resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic strains are not selective in relation to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection devices, complex compounds may contain acid (acousus, acrobin, dairy) as a pH regulator, as well as anti-microbial active benzoic acid and other cushions (aloe faith, vitamins, manthols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis carried out by the University of Oregon Public Health School showed that in terms of preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the skin, simple soap varieties are as effective as conventional anti-bacterial soap containing triclons.
Hot water is comfortable with human skin temperatures still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are multiplied much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, to remove natural fats containing pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to the widespread view, research has shown that the use of heat water does not affect the reduction of the microb burden on the hands.
A hand-defecting device (sanitaizer) or hand-held anti-septic is a hand-in-hand hygiene device that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand-to-hand hygiene (also known as alcohol disinfectants, antiseptic devices for hand disinfection or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these tools are made on the basis of ansopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of a castle, such as a carbomer (acryl acid polymer) in the form of gel, or humidizers, such as glycerine in liquid or foam, which makes it easier to use these tools and reduces the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of a diluted hydrogen transoxide further increases the anti-comic robot activity. Defectants containing at least 60-95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol disinfectants kill bacteria, including bacteria with multiple drug resistance (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis stick, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinuirrus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a reduction log of 3.5 equals a reduction of 35 decibels) in their arms 30 seconds after application and 99.99% in bacteria (a reduction log of 4-5) in their arms 1 minute after application. The hand-infection devices are the most effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol disinfectants are virtually ineffective against Norwegian-type (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol must be used to carefully process and feed the skin on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers over the entire length, grow for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
Fingers on both hands should also be carefully washed, and the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the choice be made to wash hands rather than to use disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily polluted.
The increasing popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not serve as a substitute for the full washing of hands if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
The frequent use of hand disinfectants on a alcohol basis may cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain mitigating devices and (or) skin humidifiers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigating substances to the composition of the means.
In clinical trials, alcohol disinfectants containing mitigating components caused much less irritation and skin dryness than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
Allergic contact dematitis, contact cap syndrome or hypersensitive alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of an irritable contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free means do not purify their hands from organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that disinfectants for hands are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soap and water, as pathogenic microorganisms are still in their hands when using such devices.
The effectiveness of a disinfectant for non-toxic hand depends to a large extent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than for alcohol or alcohol.
Most recently, it has been proved that the drugs using benzalcony chloride have persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to be losing efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive side-by-side skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Evil or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, this may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, the ash is a disinfectant, because when in contact with water, it forms a alkaline solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the Centers for Disease Control in the US recommend the use of handwashing techniques, including the following steps:
Put your hands under warm or cold water.
It is recommended that the water be accurate because the water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands by raising them with a lot of soap, including the bottom of your palms, as well as areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
The soap removes the microbes from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (and not just one water), people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Three hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you hold your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Pull your hands under the drain.
Hand polishing in standing water may cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands clean towels, or let them dry on your own.
The wet and wet hands are more easily polluted; most often people leave areas such as thumbs, wrists, areas between their fingers and under their fingernails unattended.
Artificial fingernails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that a wet lotion be used to prevent skin drying, which may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash hands: the discharge of water from a hanging canister or bottle pump with holes and (or) the use of ash, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries, where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as canisters and other low-cost options.
A knife-shaped crane is a simple structure consisting of a container hanging on the rope and a foot lever that should be pressurized to lick water, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some disputes over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Snapkins and Towels, which was the subject of a comparison of the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryer with warm air and more modern hand-flow air dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a hot dry dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the finger cushions increased by 194% on average and 254% on the palms.
It also turns out that after washing and drying hands in a air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger cushions increases by 42 per cent and on the palms by 15 per cent.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on finger cushions is on average reduced to 76 per cent and on palms to 77 per cent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors in toilet rooms and toilet environments with each type of drying.
The air dryer, which produces air with declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), is capable of blowing micro-organisms off its hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and sansule within a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hand dryer with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of up to 0.25 metres from drying.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess the various methods of hand drying.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria, depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers compare to paper towel dryers.
Peeling hands using disinfecting napkins can be an alternative solution during travels in the absence of soap and water.
The deinfectant for hand on alcohol shall contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemelweiss found it highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of disease in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash hands if they forget it.
According to one study, the use of such devices is indeed helping to reduce the level of contamination.
The medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water or gel used for washing and washing each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully rubbing their fingers off.
If there's dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Because microbes can stay in water on their hands, it is important to clean them well and wipe them out with a clean towel.
After the hand drying, a paper towel should be used to close the crane and, if necessary, close and open any doors.
This avoids re-polluting hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (Microbes) and prevent their spread.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread micro-organisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other basic procedures can reduce the incidence of cancer associated with catheter by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard washing and hand-treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
Whitby co-authored the review.
If proof of compliance is required, commercial devices may be used to measure indicators and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization refers to "five points" when hands need to be washed:
after contacting blood or biological fluids,
the use of anti-septics, and
After the patient's care procedures, adding antiseptic chemicals to the mouse when washing hands ("medical" or "anti-microb" soap) helps destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in a highly antibiotic-resistant environment; "cleaning" hands in front of a surgical operation requires a crane that can be switched on and shut off without touching its hands; and a little chlorgexine or iodide should also be used to polish hands, sterile towels for hand drying after washing, a sterile friction brush and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and pretentious to the elbow usually for two to six minutes.
There's no need to lose hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During the stripping process, the water with the precipice must not fall back on the hands.
Once the washing is finished, the hands will bite the sterile tissue and wear the surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash hands or use anti-septics before and after the treatment of a sick person.
In order to combat staphyloctic infections, hospitals found that the first 20 per cent of washing hand was most useful, and that very few additional advantages had been gained when the number of washing hands had been increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to washing anti-bakterial soap, washing hands with conventional soap results in more than threefold increases in the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food, comparing the washing of hands with a alcohol-containing solution and washing anti-bakterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the handling of hands with an alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial pollution by 26 per cent compared to anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions to reduce the number of influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficile dispute, and activities to develop hand hygiene in health facilities may include handwashing training, improved availability of hand-held alcohol solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff of the need to wash hands.
Further research is required on the most effective measures in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to regularize the habit of washing hands.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are not every private or public toilet with hand washing cranes, although there are cheap ways to make hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene may also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promotion and stimulation of soap-washing can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are needed to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that health surveillance at the community level is effective in improving the hygiene situation in lower-middle-income countries, while public marketing campaigns are less effective; one example of advocacy for the washing of hands in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund, "Three Star Approach": it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools that encourage the washing of pupils' hands using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that minimum standards are met, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-held personnel is one of the possible measures taken in the framework of the hand-health information campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, the United Nations Children ' s Fund promotes the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies examined the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to DALYs (the life without disability years saved).
However, one study suggests that the stimulation of washing hands with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health - especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene novelists: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse, and "the founder of modern care for the sick."
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting the hygiene of hands as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the outbreak of pig influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the organism from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "right handwashing techniques" were distributed in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "to wash hands" means expressing its unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding on Jesus Christ's crucifixion, which later became more widely used in some English communities.
In "Macbet" Shakespeare's play, Lady McBeth begins to wash her hands randomly in an attempt to purify himself from an imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with the crimes that she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe any unethical act tend to wash hands more often than others and are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after the seen will participate in any other "depressing" compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religion, the washing of hands is both a hygienic goal and a symbolic meaning: the symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha ' i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Woodhu in Islam, and religions also prescribe the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe the mandatory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Monitoring of production factors in relation to COVID-19
Monitoring of production factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health policies to control risks and combat coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control depends on the workplace and the job, based on risk assessment, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that posts with lower risk have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of illness, observing respiratory ethics, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of disease in society or international travel.
Such a category may include employees who communicate with the public, such as in schools, in a highly populated working environment and in some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic prevention measures, include high-efficiency air filters, protective screens and available personal protections in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical personnel and morgues who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are at high risk, with risk increasing to a very high level in the conduct of aerosol-related procedures by such staff or in the collection/treatment of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering safety equipment, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as personal protection tools suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have different effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own disease, the need to care for others or the fear of possible contamination.
Commercial templates can change both in respect of types of goods on which there is demand and in ways of acquiring such goods (e.g. buying in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for Preparedness for the epidemic and Response can be used in the organization of protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors, emerging homes and communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for and respond to the epidemic may be consistent with national or state recommendations.
Some of the goals of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Response is influenced by the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used for occupational safety and health for the grouping of such tools, depending on efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be addressed, the most effective safety engineering equipment is then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Security equipment means separating staff from work-related risk locations and does not rely on the employee ' s behaviour, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some risks.
All types of personal protection shall be selected according to the threat to the employee, be treated according to size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, regularly checked, maintained properly and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) considers that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
The basic responses to the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory labelling, including the closing of their mouth with hand in coughs and chimes, provision of napkines and garbage containers, preparedness for remote or replacement work, where appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of persons potentially infected is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff members with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain at home until the heat ends, the lack of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of roasting drugs or other drugs that eliminate symptoms, and that they ensure flexibility of the hospital questionnaire policy, allow staff members to stay at home to care for sick family members and ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who are not supported or suspected of having been infected with COVID-19, but there is a risk of contracting SARS-COV-2 due to the spread of disease in the society in the business area or the recent visits of such a person to the COVID-19 distribution sites.
These categories include workers in contact with the public, such as schools, high-density workers and some large retail shops: engineering and safety equipment for such groups and groups at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of door-to-door windows for customer services without exit. Administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings for communication by virtual means, the installation of replacement schedules, the cessation of non-critical visits to COVID-19 distribution sites, the development of communications plans in emergency situations, including a forum for responding to concerns, the provision of relevant training for workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the correct use of such tools, the provision of resources and the working environment conducive to personal hygiene, the requirement of regular handwashing, the limitation of access to the workplace, the provision of relevant training for workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and protection measures for workers, including the use of protective clothing and equipment, the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of hand-of-of-of-careers, the use of personal devices, the use of personal-care devices, including the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use
In rare cases, workers from such a risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, the safety of workers and other passengers requires such measures as the isolation of a sick person from other people for a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, the provision of a sick mask or the request to such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin at a cough or a cup.
Secondary crew members shall wear one-off medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protections if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves used and other one-off items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces must subsequently be cleaned and disinfected; in commercial navigation cases, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include the postponement of travel in case of illness, self-immolation and immediate reporting of the medical centre on the ship when there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination must take place in an isolated room of such a person, and in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends that short-term closures be conducted for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
Where there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as exercise of physical or choir singing, reception of food in cafeteria, increased distance between couples, adjustment of time of arrival and care, restriction of minor visits, use of a separate location of health facilities for children with symptoms of influenza.
In addition to social distance strategies, long-term non-attendance measures may be considered at a significant rate of spread in the local community. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate risk to health is considered low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as those prescribed for ambulance paramedics, including appropriate personal protection.
In the event of close contact during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their formal belts and equipment before reuse by domestic cleaning aerosols or by washing, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and the disposal of used personal protections, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical personnel who are in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged contamination of COVID-19.
They have a very high risk of contamination in the conduct of aerosol procedures, or in the collection/treatment of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or alleged contamination of COVID-19.
The procedures accompanying aerosol formation include umbrellaing, coughing, bronchoscopy procedures, some dental procedures and surveys or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers include personnel handling bodies of persons with proven illness or suspicion of being infected with COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such staff perform autopsy, they are transferred to a very high-risk category; additional engineering safety equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated facilities for patients with a confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures accompanying the formation of aerosols.
In some health-care institutions and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated with respect to the precautionary measures for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to defined waiting areas, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends the use of respirators to workers who interact up to 6 feet with patients with a confirmed disease or suspected infection of SARS-COV-2, as well as those who conduct procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosol.
In the United States, approved NIOSH respirators for a person with a N95 filter or a higher class need to be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort to the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respirator rather than physical fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
WHO recommends the wearing of surgical masks, protective glasses or protective screens for the face, coats and gloves for patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease without aerosol procedures.
In the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, N95 or FFP2 shall be used instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the lack of availability of personal protection facilities worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, access to a patient infected by COVID-19 only for those who provide immediate care, the use of only those personal protections that are necessary for a specific purpose, the long use of the same respirator, while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protections, and the recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

THEMA: [Covid-19] Pressure relief and preparation for the future
DATE/WAME MANAGEMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
EXPENDITURE: CC0: No protected rights
We live in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We've seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in e-mails, calls and chats, a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, wonderful people are working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was told that we appreciated our work.
I was reminded of the importance for the world of the opportunity to address Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that is possible through your work, whether to ensure the viability of the sites, the payment of our colleagues or the protection of community security.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and today it's more important than ever before.
At such a time as to achieve meaningful results for peace, it is not only what we do, but how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and of your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting in the coming week.
Adjustment of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to lift the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, then let it be like that.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
On our expectations, it will be necessary to work about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are received.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work properly for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you care for your family, buy food or go to the doctor's office, your well-being is our priority number one.
We're not following your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
It is not necessary to make a hospital list or rest time: simply inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, inform Brian of T&C Ops to ensure that T&C is able to provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to honour our obligations to our contractors and staff with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will receive payment in accordance with normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This implies, inter alia, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the job as a way of directing their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring remarkable results, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what we expect and can adjust your actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
Such activities should always be supported.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (other than others) carry out critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to shift the emphasis on support, which is essential to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are simply focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work twice as much to catch up with the pandemic.
You don't need to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to establish new goals and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with APP (annual plans)?
In order to meet the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budget-setting, allowing staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all those who need or want to work.
This extension allows for a significant reduction in the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps immediately after the confirmation has been received.
Thanks to the APP team for leading this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a lot of precautions, we hired an anti-auvalous cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used the medical class antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules requiring caution using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in DC County (DC) is on the Web of WeWork, which shared with us and all the staff in DC its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. completely moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions given in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we also discussed the rental of a place in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the duration of meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If required for longer sessions, consider the possibility of splitting them into a course of several days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send advance material for consultation.
Use video communication by default to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as GoogleDocs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point - a person who will monitor the arrival of questions in the chat room and monitor the list of speakers as well as the record keeping (or joint inspection).
If appropriate, please contact the Technical Support Service via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when you buy the snacks.
Join #remoties in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring web-based eergonomic manuals to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community ' s grants to cancel mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons," until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of undertaking agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimana, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
Universal sentiments in the global community are not only a disappointment at the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief in relation to mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, and not only.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor impacts and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take advantage of the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together by joining each other.
We're together in this situation and ready to help everything we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such e-mails and other important information from COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been greatly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, activities, key workflows, information coverage problems or other assistance, if necessary, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, e-mail Brian Judan.
No such change should be seen as abandoning our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable it to continue its work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for important work to be done in future weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with maximum impact as soon as such need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
An angyotensin-reversible enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (s) of cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the relevant enzyme angiotening enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiottensine II and increasing the Ang (1-7) by making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Anthiotensin-preventing enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-King Peptidasis domain M2 and a C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-D-D-D-R-R-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-C-C-C-C-D-C-D-D-C-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-R-D-R-R-D-R-D-D-R-D-D-D-R-D-D-R-D-D-R-D-D-D-
ACE2 is a single-passed type I membrane protein, its enzyme active domain reaches the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 injection domain is slapped from the trans-embraked domain by another enzyme known as the masterdase, and the soluble protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually removed with urine.
ACE2 is present in most of the organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the alveolar cells of lung type II, ererocytes of thin intestine, arterial and venereal stem cells and cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The biosynthesis ACE2 and RNC are also found in the cortex of the brain, the stripum, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to the ACE.
ACE splits the hormone angiotenzin I into a resuscitating angel II.
ACE2, in turn, slaps the carboxous end-of-the-art amino acid phenilalanin from angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyss it into a vazodylator angiot (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OHOH).
ACE2 may also separate a number of other peptis, including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotenzin, dynorphine A and greline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present at Hartnup disease.
As a trans-embrake, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-Cov (SARS virus); and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking the S1 squirrel to the SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 to the ACE2 enzyme house on the cell surface leads to endocysis and transposing both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the squirrel S of the thermal protein of the TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which led some to the idea that reducing ACE2 levels in cells could help to combat infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend that the standard treatments of APF and BRA inhibitors continue.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was due to a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced for patients who have received APF inhibitors who have been at greater risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the decline in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with a general risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be an innovation in acute lung therapy and appears to improve the lung hemodinamic and oxygen soaking from the acute respiratory deficiency syndrome caused by lipopolisacharides.
The half-out period rhACE2 is about 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with unsustainable classical inhibitors of the Renin-Angiottenzin system (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases where the circulating angiotrin II is increased. The intake rhACE2 was assessed in clinical trials for acute respiratory distraught syndrome treatment.
COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons ("contaktes") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications officially supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed in some regions.
Several options have been developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, particularly with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of users of applications.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user ' s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the Bluetooth support function directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, launched an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the Government, and North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!" application, which works on Bluetooth, which helps to track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the application was awaiting registration at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the communications tracking annex was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks, and similar applications were planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TrackTogether Annex and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an application with geozonation function designed to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise from application-based systems, including false reactions and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
Given the concern about the distribution of misleading or harmful "cronavirus" applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their applications related to the Crown to App Store to include only "official" or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
The participants in the confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through applications related to coronavirus; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the observation infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for such oversight to be limited.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for their public projects:
The surveillance must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The extension of monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by time-limit clauses;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 dissemination targets;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proof of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
should be guaranteed protection against abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Genzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple propose a joint plan to address the ongoing observation problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as the need disappears.
In some countries, web-based location tracking is used instead of applications, avoiding the need to load the application and avoiding tracing.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Networked solutions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with confidentiality, which use central servers only for communication purposes (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and card transactions, and then merged them to create text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contact with infected persons, but has also made information about the location publicly available, which has been made possible by significant changes in the protection legislation that have been introduced since the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites: countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
Tracking contacts where confidentiality remains a well-established concept, a significant amount of research literature on which is dated at least 2013; as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups have worked on decisions that provide confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts, which include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy track (DP-PPT/DP-3T), time contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile tracking mechanisms (ACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identification data never leave the device and all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to maintain confidentiality in collecting and using location data or crossing routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform is based on the studies presented in "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020, another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a confidential technology development company, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technology to enable users to share confidential data on location and state of health with other users and officials without endangering the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace reference code used in its official annex.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the work of the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Development of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of people infected by the Crown but to maintain data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with constant surveillance, first by introducing the system through the updating of the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Reposition of the drug (also known as reprofiling, diversion, modification or therapeutic diversion) is the reprofiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than that originally provided for in the development process.
This is one of the research areas currently being used to develop safe and effective treatment methods for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the reconvalescent plasma. SARS-COV-2 contains some 66 proteins exposed to drugs, each of which has several liganda-coupling sites.
The analysis of these connecting sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-aurus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 are Papain-like protease, RNC-dependent RNC-polymerase, Helika, protein S and ADF-ribofosfatase.
Hussein AA and the co-authors examined several candidate compounds in their doll study, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochin is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorohine and related hydroxychloroxin would be among the four products studied under the "Solidarity" clinical test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the tests for chlorine and hydroxychloroxin would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA allowed the use of hydroxychloroxin sulfate and phosphate in accordance with an emergency application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical testing process and was permitted under EUA only as a pilot treatment for patients who were hospitalized but could not receive clinical treatment.
CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroxin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York School of Medicine in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroxin.
China's clinical trials in Huhan and Shenzhen have shown that the favipirir is "so effective."
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had an average negative result in four days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had 11 days of illness.
In Ouhana, a study was carried out to monitor 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of whom received a favipiravier and the other half were Umyphenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results of the drug ' s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to supplement its stocks, and that military resources would be used to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of buying a drug, which could be less effective in the cases of disease that had been launched.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of lopinavir and Ritonavir (Caletra) anti-aurus drugs concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been identified."
Preparats have been developed to inhibit HIV transmission by linking to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicines to find a connection that will connect with the SARS-COV-2 protease. In the scientific community, the reprofiling of drugs that have been specially designed for HIV and AIDS therapy is criticized.
WHO has incorporated the combination of lopinavire and rhythmonavire into the international test of Solidarity.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections, and then Gilead Sciences found that the remdesivir has anti-vavirus activity in vitro with regard to many pneumo, paramixo, and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with anti-retroviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that the remdesiver can have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are under way, including two at Cleveland University Clinics; one is conducted on moderate patients and the other on patients with more severe forms.
Three clinical trials are currently under way for vitamin C injection for people who are hospitalized with a serious COVID-19 form: two plasma-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of Placébo (Italy).

Tocilysumab (anti-IL-6 trailer): approved in China.
Also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against the SARS-Cov-2 virus to be obtained in the past 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread worldwide, resulting in significant investments in vaccine development and research in its connection.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI ' s vaccine development initiative are to provide the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under study and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I security studies:
Nucleic acid (NDC and RNC) (stage I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRN-1273)
A virus vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, Type 5 adenovyrus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are being used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); 37 additional candidate vaccines have been declared but are not readily available (some of them are expected to be in the planning or development phase).
In phases I-II, pre-safety testing and immunogenity are usually randomized, plasma controlled and several sites, while identifying more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the tests usually involves more participants, including a monitoring group; at this stage, drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness while simultaneously monitoring side effects at best doses.
Of the 79 active candidates (approved at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on a person (not yet in the stage of pre-clinal research).
On 24 January 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modified virus proteins to stimulate immune response.

Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-recipient COVID-19 RNC vaccine.
The vaccine candidate ' s fee was developed within 14 days of continuity from China.
In late March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
Around the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of US$ 192 million specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, which would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing of PittCoVacs, a possible COVID-19 vaccine on mice, stating that "MNA introduced SARS-Cov-2 S1 sub-unit vaccines, causing strong responses to anti-gen-specific antibodies [wealth] that had emerged two weeks after immunization."
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Pharmacist School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine that could be produced in the form of a nazi spray.
With bacteriaphags, DNA will be multiplied within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers, combined with the resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits other than those for disease prevention.
Another random study conducted in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to assess the effectiveness of animal vaccines characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need to control infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
The sanctions against SARS and MERS were tested against animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that are safe and effective for people.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world, and there is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that had been conducted at that time could become a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic devices against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one DNA-based MERS vaccine that passed phase I of the human clinical trials, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in the process of being developed, two were adenovyrus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S-S).
Social media spread the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 was not a new virus, and that it already had a vaccine.
Social media publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequence of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughs and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, pain in the throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly spread in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released in the air in coughs, sneezes or conversations.
Although these drops are formed in the event of a breath, they usually pose a threat by falling on the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through air at long distances.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live within 72 hours on the surface.
It is most infected within the first three days of the occurrence of symptoms, although it can be spread both before symptoms occur and at later stages. Standard diagnostic method is a polymerized chain reaction with a real-time reverse transcriction (RT-CRPD) on a sample taken as a noso sip.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with a suspicion of illness and to those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks vary among the population: some agencies recommend not using them at all, some recommend their use and others require them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local prevalence has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breath.
Emergency symptoms include a difficult breathing, permanent pain or feeling of restraint in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, sneaking a person or a lip; if the symptoms mentioned above are present, immediate medical attention should be sought.
The symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, smashing, or pain in the throat, can also be observed.
In addition, various percentages are characterized by stomach symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some cases of disease recorded in China were initially manifested only by a sense of consolation in the chest and a growing heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress through pneumonia, polyorganic failure, and eventually death.
It's called an incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people have been exposed to symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and it is reported that symptoms do not occur in all infected persons.
The role of such immunized carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with immunized periods of disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, and Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were immunized.
China ' s National Health Commission began to include unsympathic cases in its daily report on 1 April; out of 166 cases recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) refused to be immature at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
There's more drops in the air in loud speech than in normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that drops can be distributed at a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) in open coughs.
The virus is generally not airborne, but the National Academy of Sciences assumed that bioaerosol transmission of the virus was still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located outside the human rooms showed the existence of a viral RNC.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (RHR), may lead to the dispersal of exhalation products and thus to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through fecalia, however, this risk is considered low; virus is the most contagious when symptoms occur; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one patient usually affects two to three other people. The virus can survive on the surface from hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on the map surface the virus could live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent, when properly used, have a very useful effect in controlling contamination: soap destroys the fat protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and can remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconyl chloride and chlorohexane gluconate (surgery disinfectant), are less effective against the virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, the saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients had the first test showing the highest concentration of the virus in blood, and the sixth patient had the highest levels of the virus in blood on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new severe coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases recorded in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in natural coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens up its protective cover.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates the host cells through an anthiotensin-receiving enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of light type II.
The virus connects with ACE2 and enters the host cage by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein, "sipa" (pedler).
12 per cent of infected people who entered the hospital in Huhana were diagnosed with acute damage to the Myocard, which is more common in severe forms of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammation and immunization of the disease, but acute damage to myocard can also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2receptors are present in large numbers in the heart because they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venereal thromboembolium (25 per cent) was observed in patients with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse projections. The autopsy of patients killed by COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocitose infiltrates in lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism towards ACE2-expressive epithelial cells of respiratory tracts, patients with heavy COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyper-retrophying.
In particular, it has been found that T-cells pathogenic by the GM-CSF are correlated with the recruitment of fantastic monocytes from IL-6 and heavy lung pathologies from COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy also detected lymphocytic infiltrations.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
A full-time chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on the respiratory samples obtained by the nozzle, but a sample of the nose or wet shall also be used.
The results are usually available within a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at a two-week interval, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop tests using a polymeric chain response (PCD) to detect the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect current infection as well as possible past contamination had been under development but had not yet been widely disseminated.
China ' s experience in examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing for its use at the end of this month. The diagnostic instructions issued by the University of Zhunnan University Hospital indicate methods for detecting infection based on clinical and epidemiological hazards.
Bilateral long-range sub-polarization tricks by type of "match glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterial distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Suburban dominance, the symptom of a brilliable bridge (long-tracking of a partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are evolving as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic damage and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Main results of the pathological autopsy study:
Macroscopia: plevitis, pericarditis, seal and pulmonary
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light form of pneumonia: lung drain, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, intersticial infoculation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudat.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distractic syndrome (RDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Living pneumonia: the organization of exudats in alveolar areas and light intersticial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse Insular Clearance (DVD)
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of contamination include staying at home, avoiding people's places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing the rules of respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with non-washed hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a napkin in cough or chishing, or, in the absence of a napkin, cover the mouth and nose of the inside side of the elbow area of the arm.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a good hygiene procedure be conducted for the hands.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of infections to persons with immunized periods of disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and enterprises have been closed, restricting the movement of citizens and eliminating major public events.
Recommendations on distance also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no proven effective drugs against COVID-19 since the vaccine is not expected to be completed until 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are to reduce the epidemic's peak known as "plate out" .
The CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, as well as before eating and after freezing, coughing or sniffing.
CDC also recommends the use of disinfecting alcohol (with at least 60 per cent alcohol) for hand-treatment, but only when soap and water are inaccessible. WHO provides two prescriptions for local production to regions where such disinfectants are not sold.
These formulations use ethanol or isotopes with anti-microbial activity.
Hydrogen transport is used to eliminate the bacterial dispute in alcohol and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic hand handling.
The glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown supporting therapy, which may include infusionic therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that the virus is infected wear a normal medical mask.
Extracorporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
To strengthen immunity, personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets are recommended.
Supportive therapy can be shown to patients with easy symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the US, intensive therapy and pulmonologists compiled the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment of COVID-19 was available.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend a choice for paracetamol (acetaminophene) over ibuprophene.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in health facilities, when implementing procedures in which air cape emissions, such as intubation or hand drying.
CDC recommends the placement of medical personnel taking care of people from COVID-19 in an air cell (AIIR) - an additional measure, in addition to standard precautionary measures in terms of contact and air. CDC issued recommendations on the use of personal protection (SIZ) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protection: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. From the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial use, but the FDA allowed the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency application permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but when not instructed, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, in the last instance, the production of masks on its own at home.
In most cases, the shapes of COVID-19 flow are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is required.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalised patients with respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an intense air flow or two-tier positive air pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as the IWL.
Some doctors choose to invasive mechanical ventilation of lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nasal rubber with intense air flow; the risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in heavy form requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent of patients had been hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent had died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually re-enacted.
The task of artificial ventilation of lungs is complicated because acute respiratory distracing syndrome (ARDS) developed under COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming increasingly problematic.
IVL, with the support of inhaling pressure and PFCs, is necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage to the ventilation resulting in the development of pneumotorex.
In earlier fan models, high PFCs may not be available.
Research into potential treatment began in January 2020, and several anti-retroviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivaire seems to be the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Controversial drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of illness.
WHO recommended volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorization for the use of reconvalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where human life is in serious or imminent danger.
It has not been subjected to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to control the outbreak of the disease.
For entry, users must enter their name and identification number.
The annex may detect close contact with surveillance data and thus determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-imsolation but also sends notification to local health authorities, the large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence, such tools are used to track infected people and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the mobile phones of people who were allegedly infected by the Crown.
Quarantine and protection measures have been taken for persons who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the German federal government agencies and Robert Koh Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Galler, explained that cellular network operators report that "40 per cent of people still move across the territory."
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia ' s President Kersty Kalulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: "Intensified social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession - ideal conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being."
Disease may occur in a light form with slight or missing symptoms that resemble other common diseases of upper respiratory tracts, such as the ordinary cold.
Patients with a light form of disease are usually recovered within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of having severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although no such data are available for COVID-19. Some COVID-19 people may have lungs and cause pneumonia as complications.
For those with the most severe periods of COVID-19, rapid progress can be made in acute respiratory distracing syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory deficiency, septic shock or polyorganic failure.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
Trombosis abnormalities, especially the increase in protrombin times, were described for 6 per cent of patients admitted to the hospital from COVID-19, while the kidney function was violated by 4 per cent of the group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 are raised by liver enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the average time between the occurrence of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days for patients transferred to the intensive care unit.
According to early case studies, the average time from initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Hystopathological studies of post-mortem samples of lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cellic fibroicsoid exudats in both lungs.
Pneummocytes have seen viral cytopatic changes.
The appearance of the lung was like acute respiratory distractic syndrome (SORD).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were the rise of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of patients hospitalized had previous health problems; access to health resources and socio-economic conditions in the region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary according to condition due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
Inadequate estimates of cases in light form may lead to an overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Chickens have had severe symptoms of COVID-19 generally 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive therapy or die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had reduced their lungs by 20 to 30 per cent and their scan had detected injuries.
After recovery, it can also lead to "after intensive therapy" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who had recovered from the virus were immune to it.
According to other coronavirus streams, this is considered likely, but it was also reported that after recovery from COVID-19 the coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been a prolonged period of illness rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, animal-born and infectious.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the virus was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, describes 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the time of the spread of the disease, are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the parameters of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO adopted the ICD-10 emergency code: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed infections of SARS-COV-2 and U07.2 - for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-COV-2 infection - the ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain time interval.
According to the statistics of the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections was 6.9 per cent (153,822,240,191).
This figure varies from region to region: some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the mortality rate resulting from the transmission of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect indicators of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all patients who have suffered infection, the presence of such antibodies shows how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillion d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 persons (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the Carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population can have antibodies based on donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The greatest risk group is that of men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has been reduced only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertension among men at younger ages than for women) can lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of deaths from COVID-19 occurred among men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ODS, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially designated the disease as COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana Gebreisus, explains: "CO" means "a crown," "VI" means "virus," "D" means "disease" (disease), and 19 years when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid sending to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO further uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
And the disease, and the virus itself is usually called the coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Ouhana, China, the virus and the disease were usually called "a coronavirus" and "a southern coronavirus."
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical locations in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms "seated respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official titles "COVID-19" and "SARS-Cov-2" were published.
Owing to restrictions on standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as tampons, for the taking of lubricant from the nose, as well as parts of the IWL machine.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a vent valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame, while one of the local proceedings was re-assigned and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and faecal information about the origin of the virus, its extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects have become high on the Internet.
People may be infected with another animal virus.
Research did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
To date, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or medicines to treat it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARY Trial Programme (SOLIDARITY test), which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered most effective to date.
The vaccine is not yet ready, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 enter human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous SARS-CoV studies.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole-virio vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response from the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-shaped protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNC or RNC vaccine, new vaccine method).
Experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical vaccine test for four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code from a virus that causes the disease, and the anti-teleosavimization was identified as a potential problem in the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were under way.
The vaccines approved for malaria treatment were assessed in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroxin or chlorine.
The reprofiling of anti-aurus drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III remdesive studies were carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs had been carried out. For the same purpose, several other existing COVID-19 antiviral drugs, including remdesives, chlorohin and hydroxychloroxin, lopinavire/ritonavir, as well as lopinavire/ritonauvir, in conjunction with the beta interferon, were also under consideration.
As of March 2020, preliminary data were available on the effectiveness of the remdesiver application.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chlorine used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorohine.
The Uhany Institute of Virus Sciences recommends a daily dose of one grams, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to a lethal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for hydroxychloroxin and chlorochine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also refer to interferon, ribavirin or umyphenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high ribavirin doses are needed to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro.
Nitasoksanid was recommended for detailed study in vivo by demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-Cov-2 at low concentrations. Studies showed that in order to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, it was necessary to replace the squirrel with the trans-embrake of the trans-embraced ser 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research into the use of chlorochin and hydroxychloroxin with or without azitromicin has serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study; Ozelthavir does not inhibit SARS-Cov-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
There may be hypercytokinemia as a complication at the late stages of the heavy shape of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroxin may have hypercytookiemia properties, and a small study by the National Health Commission of China has included tocilysumabe in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug has reached the second stage of an unconventional test carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with severe forms of disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis for ferritine to detect cytokin storms, it is designed to counter such factors as are considered to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by an antagonist of interleakin 6 receptors based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refracter cytokin syndrome due to another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no evidence that the Tocilysumab is an effective means of treating cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of COVID-19 patients to people who need them is now regarded as a non-vacatory method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results have not been successful.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibodies therapy can protect against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-telodependent cytotoxicity and/or fagocitis, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent serum may be increased, consisting of a liquid part of the blood of healing patients and containing antibodies against the virus.
