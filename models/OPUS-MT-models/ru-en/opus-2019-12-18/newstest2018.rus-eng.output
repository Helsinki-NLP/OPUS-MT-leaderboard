President Vladimir Putin of Russia signed the law establishing administrative liability for breaching the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of the failure of customers to comply with their obligations in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs could not receive payment under existing public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take the issue into special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unfair customers who entered into unfunded contracts, they tried to evade their obligations to pay and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, 97,000 submissions have been made, 45,000 officials have been subject to disciplinary proceedings and 533 administrative cases have been brought before the investigating authorities for the conduct of procedural checks, of which 46 have been brought in criminal proceedings.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-million-dollar contracts.
Basque debt has resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for a much more modest amount.
This is a typical case.
The manager of a small company won the social service competition for several million rubles.
The man invested all of his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money in due course.
The result is a growing financial coma of salary, tax, credit that would result in bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought assistance from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
The problem has now been maximized in a number of regions.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total amount of public and municipal debt identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with the local authorities, where all violations that have been discovered by prosecutors are thoroughly investigated and measures taken to address them without delay.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Jaroslav and Ekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ amending the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with regard to the administrative liability of the employer ' s officials for breach of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement to ensure public and municipal needs, which was signed last week by the President of Russia, would greatly improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Attorney-General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article that provides for a fine of between 30,000 and 50,000 roubles for breaching the employer ' s official ' s time and for payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been administratively punished for a similar offence, he is awaiting disqualification for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit issued a warning on moving to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory State policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "Prevention for traveling the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until 28 August 2017, calls upon Afro-American travellers, guests and citizens of Missouri State to be particularly attentive and cautious when travelling across the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently taken place throughout the state and brought here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, declaring a warning on the movement of the group prompted a recent law in Missouri, which made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, and the fact that State law enforcement agencies were disproportionately targeted by minorities.
"You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of skin colour, beaten and killed, told by the newspaper Kansas City Old, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints more often than ever before."
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the organization vis-Ã -vis the U.S. state.
The Group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he was out of petrol during a state trip, and Missouri State police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Missouri, according to which the possibility of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
"The point of warning is that people are aware of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money to bail or report to their relatives that they travel across the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, making the State sixteenth in the State as a result of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to the new law of Missouri State, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in connection with housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, should have increased the number of racial checks.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown officers fired a police patrol in the Egyptian town of Isna, reporting Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement personnel.
One of the intruders was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law abolishing free baggage for non-return flights
The head of Rosfort Oleg Safon stated in an interview with the RBC television channel that "preferably" refers to the adoption of a law abolishing the free passage of baggage at non-return flights.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have baggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has baggage," he stressed (the TSS citata).
In doing so, Mr. Safon noted that, despite the fears of citizens, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of the top clothes and mobile phone in the handhold.
"Would it be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the top clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad or even to some computer that's not gonna have a relationship," said the head of Rosfort.
Earlier, Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the free passage of baggage at a non-return flight.
This means that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-return rate themselves.
Vladimir Putin ordered the elimination of Baikal contamination
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at the Baikal Defence Meeting, reported that large areas of the lake had been severely polluted in recent years.
It commissioned the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementing agents to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full-scale remediation of contaminated areas.
"There is also a need to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out," quoted by the "RIA News" of the President.
He added that the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation should carry out a verification of the detection of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by recreational organizers.
"I want to stress this: not everyone in a row to check, but it is also a measure to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Office of the Attorney-General reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental surveillance.
Remember, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated that there was a need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories with special protection.
The residents of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, were informed about economic problems.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donska, immediately proposed to address the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Government of Buryatia it was recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economy had proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in Southra.
In the village of Sociv, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, Rahtinya, together with residents of the Berez region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honour of the Holy See, Nikolai Chodist.
His location is a river bank, the temple will be well seen from afar, so he will serve as a travel beacon for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed and church bells are available.
The fleet ' s game REB provided escorts.
The temple is named after Saint Nicolas the Wondership, as it is recited to the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
At the same time, in the Seventh, fishing gives settlers jobs and feeds them.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as local sightings.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why is Singapore complying with laws?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but smokes are carefully stored in an iron box with him from his office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urna - 100 feet [100 m] - and throws the bulls out there.
It's 500 local dollars for garbage in a public place, reports Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, it's just a reflex, you can't throw a phantom from a candy on a bridge, you're gonna be fucking fast.
And now there's a video camera all over it.
Indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, like a museum.
Chang tells us three months ago, his neighbour's 18-year-old son drew graffiti from the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?
Imagine.
He got ten hits with a wooden stick on the lambs and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the unbelievably severe laws, the A ' F ' s explorer has dealt with the site.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, explains counsel Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has a long history of not giving a damn about both the EU and the US.
If a person carries or sells large quantities of drugs, he is given a hangover.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Premier, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
But the guy ended up hanging anyway.
After that, our country's drug couriers are moving hard.
In Singapore, it is stated that the laws are binding on all, not only modest and ungrateful people.
It doesn't matter who you are, a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a member of the European Union.
One option in this case: if you find a glass of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk through Singapore and you meet a bunch of warnings all over the place, you give a fucking diva how many bans are in this city-state!
For example, the gum is only sold in pharmacies and can be bought strictly by a doctor.
There's not gonna be a gum in the tourist's house, but it's worth sticking "skin" in the subway, imposing a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two men with white slippers on my neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to a fine, the urna is often sentenced to "shelf in the palaces" for a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6,000 roubles are paid by a criminal who forgot to clean water in the public toilet, and when attempting to repair a small need in the elevator of a residential home, a special detector works to block the doors and send a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are the prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive pouring of the room plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they are fined 5,000 Singapore bucks.
Anyway, there's a thought: no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
It's not like that, it's trying to trust me, Mohamed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years I haven't seen anyone get involved for their violation.
Why do they keep it?
So citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
Let's say if a minor sells cigarettes in a bowel, they'll be punished in a chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the intruder will get hit with sticks on the back, and the seller will be kicked and imprisoned.
It is because of such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that correct?
As early as the 1970s, we were in chaos on the roads - motorists ignored the lights, drove as they wanted, driving drunk as they wanted.
After the imposition of fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, drinking whiskey, knows that if they stop, the cop won't let go for bribes, impose a fine of the cost of the apartment and send it to jail for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson named Singapore "Disneyland With Death Penalty," a guest from the United States, horrified the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a frightening net airport" and "cultural nature."
Descending things like this are not natural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
First days in Singapore, and you're just afraid to throw the paper on the sidewalk, you're gonna catch up if you come in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and suddenly, the "shake break," the bus stop has plastic glasses.
"What's that?" You're surprised.
And here we go, the Singaporeans laugh.
Anything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught in place, but you must know that if you are assessed, you will not be taken back, because you have broken the law.
Most often, it's enough for a person to act normal.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, I moved very cautiously - motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw trash in the urna too.
Singapore, however, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth through the recruitment of dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll figure it out.
That's human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was wearing a wheel until they were fined.
Although Singapore was the main one, it was not fines, but voluntary compliance with the law.
And we have people in Russia who would also like clean streets, no debris in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
In the rest, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at them.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue Freedom.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand that as well as everyone else, from here on, the deliberate theatre demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at the Fairdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump government, knew no doubt what he had done when he put a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with journalist CNN Jim Akosta about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller hasn't tasted the statue himself.
Half the owners of pleasureships and artists who depict the Statue Liberty would lick him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to use her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the conclusion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller yelled at Akosta: "I don't want to go in deep history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sparks the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller correctly described the facts, but as he himself said, it wasn't really about history.
It's about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest ones: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds wishing to breathe freely, / the unfortunate departures of your sobil shores."
Never before were the "unforgettable dumps" so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, he made it clear that Trump wasn't expecting these people in America.
This dispute about the sense of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the ceiling after her death - knew very well that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to establish a link between the French and American republics by means of a banal classic figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Expelled.
The connection of poems and images was a brilliant feminist movement and a devastating attack against American naiveism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right ones, though, to change it back.
The loudening Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Crusader who announced Trump's arrival in 2010, held that freedom did not invite anyone, but rather she was an early neoconservator carrying America's flames to the dark world: "Water is moving forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch isn't needed to light the way to the US."
Limbo's usage is really at the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as if it had been seen by man-made, unhappy, but full of hope by people on decks of ships after a long and often heavy journey.
That means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to the words of hope and hospitality they want to hear.
And, of course, it's not the prospect Miller and Trump would ever want to admit.
Their torch does not need to light the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
The 2017 World Championship: Neil Blake values the Scottish members of the British team.
Eilede Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scots in the UK team.
Neil Blake, the director of the game of the British Federation of Light Athletics, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game."
The record number of Scottish passenger tickets was selected at the London Championships of 2017, starting on Friday.
Blake thinks there's something special in Scotland and the British Federation of Light Athletics should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand it and we're gonna support it while they have potential," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's connected to what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Light Athletics thinks what they've done has to work with.
The British Federation of Light Athletics: with what they did, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why the circumstances have happened, but it's quite brilliant."
Some of the Scottish passenger tickets claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buchert, which will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Ailead Doyle chose her team as his captain.
"Alyde is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"A lot of lungs, whether they're Scottish or not, and where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling pride and determination to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Alyde put in her were wonderful."
The owner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, who at his fifth World Championship will run 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British team are "incredible."
The previous record of the number of Scottishs at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in the middle distance and beats five British and two European records last year, is heading forward.
She's gonna run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who's gonna be involved in the 1,500 m race, is another Scottishman who needs to be noticed: behind his back, he's got a good season where he won the British team's selection contests and the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship when Lee McConnell was the only Scottish member of the team.
The captain of the team says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for exit into the final.
"The captain of the team chooses other members of the team, so it was in any case a great honor, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, "that's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottishs who joined the team.
This shows how much we've achieved.
And they're all strollers that will try to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it's to get support from fans and take advantage of what we're gonna be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to go to his arena and compete, and the atmosphere is gonna be amazing."
Facebook critical lockdown: You don't have to go to public office if you're not ready to listen to criticism from voters.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He was, of course, annoyed by criticism.
But he didn't shut his mouth with his critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said: "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech and of us, the deaf and the dumb, to lead us as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to see Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that.
The subordinate governor called this lawsuit null and void, and the commentary on the Internet was written in the spirit of "Well and what."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
He's second in the approval ratings of 50 of the country's governors.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactioner.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his constituents and to make jokes, showing his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared to be an official public forum and held by the administration for taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Chas defended the Governor ' s actions, claiming that blocking comments was just their renewal.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and heyters that hate the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, a teacher, businessman, pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible by appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramana's lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary to the article in the Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it's what's called a twist instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What subordinate governors call "centralized spam-ataka," others would probably call "active life stance."
Facebook is easy to edit its image by simply blocking critics or washing negative comments.
It's much less dust work than before when people were required to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical transmitters, or arrest and shut their mouths to protest.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic were taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James C. Casherys, the president of the Laudon County Review Board violated the First Amendment by robbing the voter in her account in Facecbook.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevinu filed claims with the American Civil Liberties Union for his Facebook and Twitter behaviour.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington's time, the era of affordable postal spending made about the same coup as today's Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the alias "Jurikola," "Valeryus," "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online project, his office was shut down by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty looks forward to living comfort at Renaissance Club.
The former European Champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for family convenience for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who led a neighbor at the Archerfield Links club, moved towards the final round last year until Paul Ils lost, was attached to the new site and served as the representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi club.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we've seen it come to success with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job doing this place.
He's a strong supporter of this game and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
English Ils looks forward to the opportunity to stand up for the first time for the Champion title, even though he won his 32-year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour tournament.
"It's a really special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't try to win "Extremadura Open" again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it."
Returns to battle in Gary Orr's native land, joining the European tournament for senior athletes after he was 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first appearance in Scotland since the tournament "Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open" in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said Helensborough Orr.
"You want to do well, but you feel this extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are so far."
On the field, the trio will be joined by the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Wussem, and the major champions for senior athletes Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrans are two of the six Scottish people on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McLister, Bill Longmier and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free and parking costs Â£5 per hour if one person is in the car and Â£10 if two or more people are in the car.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Suitable tunnels above highways capable of absorbing car carbon monoxide are already being tested on British roads.
The country ' s transport agency, as reported by Autocar, reported on the positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
A 6-metre high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the major measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, English are planning to expand the network of electric charge stations, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, increase the use of commercial transport on electric traction and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution is due to transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorud changed the punishment of a disabled Mamaev to a fine
Mosgorud changed the penalty for a disabled person, Anton Mamaev, sentenced for four and a half years by a colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
It's reported to the TASS.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to replace the period by conditional, explaining its request that Mamaev's disease "disturbed him from being imprisoned."
Anton Mamaev, a 28-year-old, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving his sentence in the general regime colony for the robbery suffered by a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released a man from detention at a visiting hearing in SIZO.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold land
Bardin Degey doesn't use the stove while preparing for lunch.
She doesn't even use a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebel province of Papua, a housewife usually simply puts sweet potatoes called "nota" in the house.
In half an hour, a hugged club gets up and eats with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degey sits on the ground floor - she doesn't have any furniture - and that's where she's doing her housework, such as washing clothes with mutant water from a nearby swamp.
The fence serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of four wives of her husband, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
There's a lot of polygamy here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk in the village after five nights," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highland of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined with Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands to the occupying forces.
The ongoing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which retains strong control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and Papua New Guinea ' s independent State is located in the eastern part of the island.
Enarothali is a city as remote as the abandoned city; the road includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, Nabira, and then a five-hour stunt on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses covered by bamboo fences; roofs of gorrified steel are painted with rust into a variety of redheads.
Few Indonesians came here, let alone journalists, and almost none of them are foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, my pago was worshiping a god named Uga Tamei.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degey, pointing at his bright, hand-held turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We only wore leaves on our body."
Papua is Indonesia ' s poorest province, 28 per cent of its population lives below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world ' s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Panama, a high province of approximately New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can absorb forest stocks valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, has caused one misfortune to the papuas, guaranteeing that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their strangled presence here.
According to an investigation into the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of papuas threaten the existence of this gold dwelling and are ruthlessly repressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings of indigenous residents of Papua's highlands in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Only last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - especially as alleged in another report, rape and electric shocks - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is hard to estimate the number of victims because the incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is researching Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Giakis have been protracted as Papua ' s resources have attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province ' s 3.5 million population is 83 per cent Christian, but demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely populated Indonesian islands - Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Yavan shop, barungi, sell a roasted chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local residents are trying to resist competition.
"The migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua," explains Abet Yoo, a 20-year-old Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, due to work.
"The indigenous people of Papua, the Mama (women) of Papua, have lost their market."
President Joco Widodo of Indonesia, known as Jokovi, pledged to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter received support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panamai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and the local population feels loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, waiting for him to fulfil our hopes for justice," says Yo.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokovi Paniai, he survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems at the fire in Enarothali when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlamps.
According to local pastor Jawedt Tebay, one soldier offended their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and witnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One kid, 16-year-old JuliÃ¡nus Eimo, was so beaten up that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About 1,000 papuas men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunters onions and performed vite, the dance of the papuas tribe Mee pago, running around and playing bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation started, soldiers were ordered on internal radio communications: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," he was said to be in an official document that the correspondents of the TYME magazine had seen, but which had not been published in local media.
Eremias Kayame, a 50-year-old, head of the Kego Coto district in Enarothali, felt at risk and called for calm by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told TIME, standing on the porch of my brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but he says that the bullet came from the front of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many gunshots," he adds.
A local resident, Alfius Youva, was hit three times, as his cousin told him to witness the shooting.
"I ran up to him and looked at his body to make sure that it was him," said darkly the magazine TIE Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, told the reporters that his officers were only "defensing" their base because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," stated in 2015 by the Papuan police spokesman, Pujo Sulistio.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news about the murders came to Jakarta only the next day.
In three weeks, Jokovi delivered a dusty speech in Jayapur, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, we're out of line.
"The majority of violations took place long ago.
Some of them occurred in the virgins or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to go through," he said.
Then, Viranto refused his words, speaking to TTIME on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through judgment."
Viranto, accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" of the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Paniai met similar statements with dark mistrust.
"I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been no change," says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm gonna be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired shots at villagers in the neighbourhood of Paniai District of Deiai.
In a clash between villagers and the construction manager, who refused to help drive a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, a twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested before the company ' s construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at officers who responded with warning shots.
But local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we're afraid of retribution," said TIME magazine, the 20-year-old Dominggu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded quickly delivered.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniay has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is a source of disillusionment by mee, monks, dani and damal scattered across the entire area of the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (FM), the rebel army, which claims to protect the rights of the papuas by holding sporadic attacks and attacking the kidnapping of people on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top PPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Panama under the pretext of "protection of national independence."
Some people never came back.
The population of Papua Paniai is considered to be a "smart, forgotten place."
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A little rice sold to Enarotali is too expensive for local residents.
The bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers are worth only Rs. 10,000 (75 cents).
Economic disparities have increased over time between indigenous papias and new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabira airport.
Few existing vacancies tend to reach more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papias rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
"The young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua far from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskyudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for "insufficiency of coordination with the relevant organizations" despite having been given rare permits to conduct a video film.
According to Felim Keen, the Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokovi's election campaign to lift media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua face new dangers: denials of visas and blacklists," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "miscellaneous and widespread violations" in Papua, including shooting at Panama.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Armamanata Nassir, withdrew from the group ' s statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
Local residents want more foreign governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Kyus Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, local residents violated their silence by praying, "We want freedom," according to the source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the Popes say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniai," said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadows of threats from the Al-Ali Army, are trapped in poverty, and their education and health are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like the other papois, consider their voice for Jokovi to be a debt that he should pay.
"We don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never succeed, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"Delayed a member of our family," said Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire hit one of the world's world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave the 70-year-old-story structure at 337 metres in a dryer.
It's the second fire that's been through a tall building, a coincidence called "Fuckel," in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and no operational news was available on the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and we took about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor, told the Reiterian of the skyscraper called George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Department, fire brigades drowned the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The incident could bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in high-rise exteriers around the world.
In an investigation by the Faquela administration following the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected by the flaming was the external panels used to process and isolate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the grenfell-Tauer flaming panels in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed some 80 people.
The increase in tourism flows to Ida Virumamaa in June was minimal
According to data provided by the correspondent of the Ruz.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from the services of North-East hotels in June 2017, an increase of 125 or 0.6 per cent over the same period of the year.
The number of local tourists has declined and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
For example, foreign tourists increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,794 tourists in June.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The largest increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region was 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 Russian guests stayed at Ida Virumamaa Hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to the fans who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans at Instagram, who was responsible for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he hasn't commented on the rumors, but today he posted a piece of the article of the newspaper "Vedestination" in August 1st.
Photo by Malakhov signed the "boss milksus" tag.
Article on how to prevent a worker from being burned and to pay attention to his condition.
When we recall the many reports that the lead was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who had begun to re-form "Pose Say," it becomes clear what he so transparently implied, writes "KP."
The television director, Andrei Malakhov, was reportedly currently on leave and did not sign the application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The termination situation can be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, handing over RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a mine car exploded near the military block in Girishk's leaving the night before last night.
We're aware of 20 dead.
There was a new sp on Friday morning in Girisch.
Armed criminals attacked the exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver took a video of his shark camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Scomal (Greg Skomal) sealed a video shark that bit him with an extenuation camera for GoPro.
Rolick posted on Facebook a unit of the American Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Scomal is a member.
The incident took place on 2 August off the coast of Cape Kod in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
A man tried to take a shark to a cell during the underwater navigation that was kept on a special stick.
After observing a man, an animal of more than three metres long sailed to him.
The shark started biting the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator had done the same to determine whether the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also observed that such behaviour of the marine animal had proved to be new to scientists.
The reason for the mass fight at the Ural Military Centre is known.
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region visited the Elalan Training Centre, where a mass attack took place, to investigate the incident.
Some details of this slaughter have already become known.
According to Mash's pub, which appeared on Vkontakte's page, the Uranian military contractors number 31612 were severely beaten because of an unattended bed.
It all started with the fact that a private man named Sayane was demonizingly ignoring an officer's order to fix a tortuous sheet.
The officers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys broke up in the bed and sink barracks, knocked out the glasses.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass fight.
The CSB denied information about the stabbing.
The study showed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States were carrying prohibited items on a plane.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board the aircraft through the United States Transport Security Administration inspection points, including at least 6 per cent landing on a plane, having been neglected with prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carrying firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which covered more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers were more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were Millenials compared to less than 15 per cent of the X Generation.
It's the most important thing that ATB personnel pass through is food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had carried out special inspections of sharp objects, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country in order to know how many of them had accidentally carried smuggling through airport searches, and how many of them had knowingly done so.
Most often, consciously or unconsciously, are expected to drag smuggling through searches by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are quite complicated and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what fluids they can carry and what quantity they can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what the ATB takes is forbidden fluids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATS could be considered banned from carrying a book.
Liquids are allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
EPA Pruitt does not intend to postpone the implementation of Obama ' s emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15 state action, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama regulations aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants that lead to formation.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position brought before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute began around the 1 October deadline for States to meet the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "responding to local solutions or obstacles to economic growth."
PrÃ¼itt, who had been appointed President Trump for his current position as the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent opponent of environmental tightening.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms against the chemical or gas non-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is the next legal defeat of the Puitt's return course.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority by attempting to delay the implementation of the Obama administration ' s policy requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by drastically changing the course on ozone standards, he had simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the states in an integrated process for the timely implementation of new standards.
"In previous EPA administrations, EPA was often unable to meet the target date, then awaiting claims from groups of activists and others and discussing the time frame for the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power that he gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point again use his "delayed powers and other statutory powers" to ensure that the rules "jcyjdfys" are clear and accessible.
The Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed an action against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
"The changes in the EPA course - after our lawsuits - are an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who were directly affected by their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delever, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as D.C. joined the New York claim.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar light.
The resulting person could cause serious breathing problems for those who are sensitive to it, causing thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmental advocates welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who was assigned to protect the air we breathe," said Laurie Anne Bird of the Biological Diversity Centre.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, and to protect those who polluted the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Pleasure Feds (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Rehabilitation Council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension should remain valid.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 against, handing over the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Council stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the re-establishment board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualifying of the WFLA at the World Cup in London, Russian lightballs were forced to act under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 persons admitted to IAAF.
WFLA was subjected to indefinite disqualification from IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, highlighting numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, read in "JO" the IAAF extended the sanctions against WFLA.
Disgusting defeat
Within the framework of the 3 tour of the Russian Fonbet Party, the new-osk-Himik PFL team held an exit match against the FC Kaluga.
A little more than 10 days ago, rivals played each other in Russia's cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The chemical didn't give up on the opponent, but the second relaxing at the end of the match led to a bad throat and fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the qualifier, with an account of 0:3, many pre-empted the easy victory of the masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the new Ossetians have been forced to be considered and acted against defence, but from the point of view of force.
In the 1st time, the qualifiers were more creative and had the advantage of holding the ball.
Another very good match was performed by Alexa Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and gave the partners confidence in his actions.
Unfortunately, the Himiku attack lacked effort and luck to put the Kalugi Defense deadlock on hold and to kill the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to take place at the counter courses.
The New Moscovans have been more active in the attack.
The alert calls for our team have been defensive errors that have allowed the qualifiers to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, chemist intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Qualhoan played its part - they had a better and more cold-blooded ending, waiting for their moment for the gate to be taken.
After a dangerous attack, chemist transferred the ball to the corner, which the owners of the field, without resistance, moved to the gate.
Yuri Dubrowin was the author of the goal.
At the reporting meeting, the chemical demonstrated a good game, but suffered an unfortunate defeat.
In advance, our team is waiting for another exit - on 11 August at 19 o'clock in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium, called Edward Streltsovov, the new Russians will fight the FC Centre's "Ararat," which includes Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmaelov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to support chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the New Ossetians - 6.30 p.m. near Magnolia (East, D.2, Corp.
Composition of Chimica: Sirotin, Manohin (c), Romaschenko, Shayunov, Homoutov, Goghiya (Oreskin), Dudayti, Rizhov, St. Belyan (Adoevts), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to published telephone transcriptions, Trump pressed Mexico on the payment of the wall at the border.
The Washington Post newspaper published phone encryptions between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique PeÃ±a Nyeta Trump insisted that he should stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the proposed wall at the border.
U.S. President ran him for publicly speaking against the wall, and he was told, "You can't talk to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, published in the decrypt, also revealed a hot rebate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should receive refugees going to Australia was "funny" and "reverse" and "tupoo" and insisted that, because of the agreement concluded by Obama's administration, it would look like an idiot because it intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation in the whole day."
The bodies of the martyrs in Abkhazia were sent by a plane from Sochi to Petersburg.
The aircraft belonging to Russia, carrying the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
At the end of the location, the flight will be met by members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city ' s mayor ' s office, and told journalists by the Deputy Minister for Ports and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Previously, MES representatives of the Republic stated that all costs associated with bringing bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to pay compensation in the amount of 500,000 roubles to the families of the victims.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership has expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the bombings to travel and reside in the Republic, but the relatives have sent only assurances to the Republic that local authorities have the right to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at around 16:20 a.m. Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsk Gudaut district in a missile-artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, after which they began to detonate large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, the storage facility was burned and caused uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
Two Russian citizens, Elena Poliakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timothy, born in 1962, were killed by the EP and were on vacation near the sero-water source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were injured in varying degrees of severity in the medical facilities of the Republic.
At present, seven people remain in the hospital and the rest are discharged.
A study of Russian influence on American elections will take place with a large jury.
The Russian Special Prosecutor's Office, Robert Mueller, convened a large jury in Washington to study Russia's influence on the election of the U.S. President in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will examine the Special Prosecutor and decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the subjects of the jury investigation that started work a few weeks ago will be the details of the son's meeting, then another candidate for President Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Vesellnitzka.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Mueller himself had previously promised.
They've already been examined by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the legal capacity of his lawyers.
Tramp Jr. had previously told him that he had been waiting for a compromise to be held at the headquarters of the candidate from Demparta Hillary Clinton, but that no disclosure documents had been provided, and that the adoption was the result.
At the beginning of August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr. ' s statement of meeting with Vesellitzka was literally imposed by Trump-old.
In the White House, it was specified that the President had not dictate anything, but simply used his authority to do what any father would have done.
The Penza Vice Mayor was detained in the workplace.
The Deputy Chief of Administration, Penza Irina Chishin, was detained for 48 hours on instructions from the Investigation Committee at her workplace, reporting to RIA Newsy.
No official reports have yet been received from law enforcement agencies on this matter, but the UK press service has assured them that they will be followed soon.
There's no comment on what happened at the Prince's Hall.
Irina Chishin is one of the five deputy heads of the administration of the Penza.
It has been in charge of urban development and land relations since April 2015.
Until then, she had worked for a long time as head of the Department of State of the Pennsylvania Region.
Irina Chishin is raising three minor children, and it is noteworthy that once again as a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there's no cosmodrome or launcher in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bustache is a tribute to the first man to have been in space.
Unlike the Soviet monuments that are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, are "showing around the planet."
In 2012, a monument was installed in United States Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was established in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited 1963.
The memorial in Karlyk Warah (Chehiya) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the centre of the city to the area before the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, the monument of Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
That's the name and name of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and it looks like it was 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists will lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
Ford Merkury passed by the viewers in the village of Monroe, Georgia, in 1948, and cried to the little Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns prevented her from going.
The main man, the middle-aged man in the suit in the thin strip, was long cigars and looked through the windshield.
The insiders were shaking for fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man drank.
"Get him out of the car!"
Prospicious splashs broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, is just a scene.
But when Roger's neck was thrown on a loop, almost all the viewers were really breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-examining the night that two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malk and George and May Murray Dorcy, were licked in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no man has been arrested in all these years - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgian Congress, which has been fighting for human rights for all its life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to Monroe's inhabitants that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the cold body of one of Morse Ford's lichen victims on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI ' s submissions received by En-Bi-Si News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But nobody was charged.
While the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that there are always two related motives of vigilante: politics and sex in the city.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling first allowed black citizens to vote in the Primeriz to be held that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, a black singer Roger Malcolm punched Barnett Hester's knife in the fight, and a white landowner, apparently, because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors that he was in town, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to have had wasn't from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loya Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorcy.
But when they drove out of prison and drove to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"He finds out he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," one of the FBI reports concludes.
"It is also clear that there has been a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, who have not only participated in the murders, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt at electoral rights," he says.
"They've all been killed to send a signal to black people in town: if you register and vote, you'll be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green runs an annual play that reproduces the lens at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, he captures the viewer and tells us about the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to see and harder to turn around, but Green thinks it's important.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own uglyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year's play began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites, the other blacks - gathered in the room and listened to the year-old play review.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He's been the main member of the clan for years, but he says the role has never been easier.
"I think I'm sick because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
In the room, actors Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Ruscon screams back.
There's a hit.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are smashing their whims.
Green laughs louder than everyone else.
"What is it" asks Ascon.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I interrupting?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the white guys said "nigga."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black actors.
"You're gonna have to say firm 'r'.
And the energy changes in the room: the discomfort changes the sense of partnership.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but also for the memory of four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n," it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
Spectacle ends harshly and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then quiet.
The woman in the mourning black clothes is standing above the bodies of the actors and performing the sad song Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted by word.
In the hundreds of yards, half a hundred viewers wipe tears and sweat out of their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of black and white viewers.
One couple came from Achi, New York, to see the show; many people live very close.
They've been through Georgia's heavy spirit for almost eight hours while Brooks took them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsy.
Until then, the murder was only a story, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were licked, it seems that their ghosts are in the air right now.
When the song's last note is quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Kids turn to their heads, touch the paint of blood, and the dead bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy wrestles, like to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw's hugging Marbo, a man in a costume who played the main doll-clan.
Nick Rascona embraces two other actors and suddenly, crying, falling into their arms: the emotional burden of the play finally fell upon him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that."
Later, the audience will have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta have a lively discussion of the black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski's hard to find words to describe how she feels after the play.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and the actions... of people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called that the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, took general attention.
He says he's already started planning the next year's presentation.
"The development inspires us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't draw from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who don't study their story, who don't know their story, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Naval for violations of the "aggitation Saturday"
The SimÃ³nov Court of Moscow fined Alexei Naval for 300,000 roubles for violating the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2, paragraph 8, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, "Receiving the organization of a meeting."
Previously, Judge Simonov of the Moscow Court of Hizir Mussakaev had completed administrative proceedings against Leonid Volkov, Chief of Staff of the oppositionr Alexei Naval, who had been held accountable under the same article as Naval.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "aggitation Saturday" that the supporters of Navala held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
When they saw the accounts following the Saturdayers, the police considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately hidden its true essence - a public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazouyev requested an end to the administrative proceedings due to the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain omissions in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the very "aggitation Saturday" but received a summons requiring him to report to the police station for an event held with his active participation.
The same subpoenas were received by Naval and another fellow oppositionr, Nikolai Lyskin.
In Mordova, the bride and three wedding guests were arrested.
The Mordova court arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the National Investigation Committee Office.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old Saransk man fired several times at the guests of the events that had come to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (Huliganity), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (e), "and" of the Criminal Code (the attempted murder of two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner from hooligan motives).
According to Interfax, the local media reported that a man had opened fire because the wedding guests had chosen to bathe and passed through his precinct to the water.
Minenergo will tighten the demands on the suppliers of turbines for power plants.
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to critical equipment providers, in particular turbines for power plants.
When the gas turbines are launched, the turbines of the nuclear power plant, the oil transponders and the oil production of the equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access with the Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The Government ' s draft decision has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only apply to "critically important energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document include information and access to management by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfair partners and hackers.
The EU expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On 4 August, the European Union Press Service stated that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to a scandal over the supply of Simens turbines to Crimea.
This has been reported earlier by the Week Arguments.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been increased by a scandal with the Simens turbines allegedly brought to Crimea by circumventing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It has previously been reported that a final decision will be taken before the end of the day, and this decision has been taken, sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life.
On Friday, the British Education Group of Pearson announced that it would reduce 3,000 more jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the launching of a new restructuring programme aimed at addressing the challenges faced by their business.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon's head of company, will largely occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it planned to reduce the cost of another 300 million pounds (US$ 394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to restore to life the business that had hit the fast transition to digital learning methods.
Last month, a company that agreed to sell its share in the publication of Penguin Random House to its partner, the end of Bertelsman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 per cent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato's soldier died as a result of a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as stated in the NATO message.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh.
This explosion, the last of Afghanistan ' s massacres this month, killed more than 30 people on Tuesday as a result of the bombing of the Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the bombing that took place on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-made improvised explosive device."
All the wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American military hospital at Bagram airfield.
The respondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as "Islamic State" (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces deployed nearby in Bagram.
The United Nations reported that at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber in a car caused at least 30 deaths in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had attacked.
On 31 May, a powerful explosion in the centre of the city resulted in the death of more than 150 people - the most serious number of human casualties in the country since the Taliban had been removed from power by United States-led troops in 2001.
Violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump estimates whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after lawsuits, rescinds the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Environmental Protection Agency reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama era law, according to which States should limit air-polluting emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency because of this step.
In the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement so-called ozone changes - 2015, stressing that this step demonstrated the agency ' s willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them," said in a statement by Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Columbia, filed a claim alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump ' s administration is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations imposed by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme, which Tramp says, for brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have led to resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency says that the use of ozone-containing air "can aggravate the function of lungs and increase respiratory symptoms," for example, asthma.
The Association of European Business has opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Business expressed opposition to US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
In the view of AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European Business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies ask the police to limit the movement on the Pskov coast.
The Pskov people's election sent an appeal to the UMRD chief of the city of Sergei Surina on the problem of movement along the Grand River.
The deputies of the pride of Constantine Bolotin, Grigory of the Party and Valerie Lesnikov believe that motorists are preventing people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the Territory safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the pedestrian track and travel freely along the coast.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements have been made for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, at night, the central coast patrol is conducted by PFP and friendly personnel.
As a result, the number of vehicles passing is smaller, but the traffic is not stopped completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to remove hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to prohibit investigating authorities from removing servers and hard disks from working computers in enterprises.
This was announced by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, "it is necessary to exclude, in order to investigate, measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard disks from working computers and servers."
Putin pointed out that if investigators had such a need, "there was enough to remove copies, assure them and use them in the course of the investigation."
The Head of State added that the conditions preventing the continuation of the business could not be met until taxes could be paid.

British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Faj in a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in his 92nd year of life.
This was reported on Thursday by the newspaper Indipendent.

Something in the Danish State, Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean AndrÃ©, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margaret.
This year, the four have a golden wedding, but the couple's agenda isn't a precinct, but it's a win-win dispute.
His Highness refused the title of the Prince Consort, and he made an announcement to the Queen that he had never complained of the title of the Crown King.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the official wife of the Queen.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on Washington to stop shagging Moscow.
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, they responded to Mike Pens, accusing Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the foreign policy department some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold-war strains that were inadequate to modern realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop moving the Russian Federation.
As the "Arguments of the Week" was written the previous day, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d'Ã©tat in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive fight.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match up to Â£147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN office premises in Los Angeles while Garcia, a non-forgivable World Boxer Council, had not walked through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization champion in the second halfweight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former World Championships in the four weight categories, Erian Broner, on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are included in the five best boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriago on Saturday at seven o'clock on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posted for the photo, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would have been the case.
"I used to be in a half weight," he reminded Garcia.
"I went up to the category for Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm short for 140.
I want to go down to half the time.
And he's gonna have to get up to half a pound, and then we're gonna have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's get them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy that he was following, that Lomachenko should spend his debut fight in weight 135 later this year in order to schedule for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), which is also interested in fighting with the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their battle for the title of the World Champion in lightweight at the Forum on 23 September.
"The fight can be on the PPV because all the fans asked for it," said Garcia, after expressing their willingness to fight later on the channel that offered the best financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko's "great boxer" and maybe he's gonna visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately put Garcia in praise and said he thought the champion in three weights from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of impact, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension in front of their own unit.
"This fight has to take place.
No other fight is causing so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for some of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."

Putin instructed the Attorney General to check Baikal.
President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to carry out an inspection of Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.

In addition, the Russian leader requested action if violations were identified.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden were published
The latest results of the tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 per cent of the protesters have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all have confidence in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of the age of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for failing to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be underage.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published 2,481 tests between Seredia March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the tested "believably 18 years of age or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person was "probably less than 18."
Tests are carried out only when the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past months.
"We don't see much difference with statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite relevant," he said to the Local portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that 442 "most likely, the age of 18 years or more."
However, after considering 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had publicly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, which consists of making the x-rays of the wisdom and tomography of the knee joints and giving them to the dentists and X-rays, has also led to criticism in some jurisdictions.
One of the skeptics is the endocrineologist from Claude Marcus University of Carolina, whose work is part of an assessment of the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have passed through puberty sooner or later.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we need to use the way we measure now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define him with confidence, we shouldn't pretend we can, he said Metro.
However, Geranssen, an agency of forensic medicine, argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: "It can be said in general that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a person is 18 years old, then he's about 10 percent."
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin announced that he would be willing to consider whether to run for the presidency of Russia in the 2018 elections, and that he would be passing the Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Cheremusha of Buryat region.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkut province, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential election is held, we are all asking you to run again for this office."
"Okay, I'll think, thank you," said the president in return.
On 28 July, the Press Secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, commented on the statements made by some media that Vladimir Putin's election headquarters would be headed by President Anton Wyno, Chief of Administration of the Russian Federation.
Peskov called these assumptions "nothing based on, hypothetical reasoning."
"Until there is no headquarters, until the headquarters are established far, until the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"Until it's on the agenda," Peskov said.
Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justis, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Trump, which would go to another party.
"Do you like it or not, but the Democrats have left me" said Governor Justis.
"I tell you today with many prayers and many thoughts... today I tell you, the people of West Virginia, I can no longer be of use to you as governor of democracy."
Ming exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I'll change my registration for the Republican," added Justis.
"As coach, I'd tell you the time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justis did not support the candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that it owns coal mines in five states because it inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday night that "the transfer of Governor Justis to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more disturbing than working to make our country a great again."
"Taking into account only 15 governors and controlling the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justis's statement is just another rejection of the party, which has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," reported in the CBS News statement by the representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ronna McDaniel.
Mr. Beautiful found the house because of social media.
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat called Mr. Beautiful, weighing more than 14 kilograms after becoming famous because of the Internet.
This is reported by Maschable.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat asking him to find his master was published on Facebook in a pet account, because "he was obviously fed by someone before."
In the comments, the users noted that the expression of the animal's face could become a new meme.
The publication has received more than 3.2 thousand lakes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Beauty.
As a result, he was placed in the hands of Angela Frazi (Angela Frazee), who promised to do more than his weight.
In an interview on WNCN, an American woman told me that she had already had such experience: she took a cat home of about 10 kilos, and now he weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The animal's photo post has collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could make a career in a model business.
Cou praised Russia's "better" apology for the doping scandal.
The international expert on the lung athlete, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday for what he called Russia ' s sincere apologies for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not the right time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, Dmitri Schlahtin, reported to the Congress of the International Association of the Elementary Feds, which had taken place on the eve of the World Championships on a light athlete, that his country ' s exclusion from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen from the competition.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Pleasure Feds voted to retain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of State-funded doping.
"I thought today's response, today's report was very sincere," the report was told to reporters by President of the International Association of Pleasure Feds of Coe.
"All the advice and the whole convention enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it had been through extremely hot times and was now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said that he also liked it, that Russia accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we're moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," said Coe.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Pleasure Feds, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Cup on a light athlete, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the ad hoc commission of the International Association of Pleasure Feds, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met to rebuild Russia.
According to him to reporters in London, following a report made to the Board of the International Association of Pleasure Feds, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient numbers, and suspended coaches are still doing their job quietly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
A Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) journalist, Vasily Murravitzki, was arrested for two months and handed over the SBU.
An Internet officer at the Journal of Githomira is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating Ukraine ' s territorial integrity.
In doing so, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this "warbar politics" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libyan territorial waters to then, together with the Navy of that country, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposing cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobrauk accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his subordinate orders to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe those threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Head of Europe's recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraja.
Italy ' s authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration since the publication of statistics on the number of illegal arrivals from Libya in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that the resources for receiving migrants had been exhausted.
Skype's large-scale malfunction
Skype's global failure has now been recorded in several countries around the world.
The users started sending complaints to programme developers on Thursday, 3 August.
In Microsoft, it was stressed that specialists were already actively working to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, and clarified the Newity RIA.
Remember that Skype also failed in June this year.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of Ukraine ' s team on light athlete have been suspended from participating in the FM.
Olga Earthk and Olesia Povech, specializing in short distance, are excluded from Ukraine's team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Light Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision has been taken by the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Passenger Federations (IAAF) against small arms.
The Ukrainian delegation was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation by Coach Earther Sergei Basenko.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects a sportsman using doping.
Powch is the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European Championship in the centafe 4 to 100 metres, and the Earthman is the winner of the 2012 European First Party in the centafe 4 to 400 metres.
The Peace Championship on Light Athlete in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How football financial rules will affect Nemara's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world's record transfer Neymar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. German.
Any further consequences may arise along the chain, for Pari Saint-Jermen, by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power the command is prohibited from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament.
From the Financial Fair Play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the SCW will eventually have to show that Neymara's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid Euro222 million ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
The "UPW" can certainly break up to hire Nymar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team from the rich energy of the ruling Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP led Michelle Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in great debt in their quest for success were, in fact, cheating and risking devastation if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on the club's debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then to spend seriously in order to improve the team and create a world brand - has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which covers 2018, clubs may be liable to losses of 30 million euros.
And despite the shame that Platini was removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
"It's gonna work, "FFP is alive, and we're gonna go ahead and tighten the rules," announced last week to Associated Press, Andrea Traverso, which controls the FFP in UEFA.
Although the SCW will pay for Neymar's contract once, it may, for the record, distribute the amount for the duration of its contract.
Neemar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, heavy sanctions were imposed on the "FPW" as well as on the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
A fine of Euro60 million (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, was ordered to limit its team to the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that might try to decorate its financial inspections by blowing up their income on the account of companies associated with the owners of the club.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored the SCW, if funding had been considered to exceed standard market prices, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the funding of SCW from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been distributed.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings in SCW could come from the organization's 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But the "UPW" and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be the ambassador of the World Championship, and such a manoeuvre could easily be found by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on SCW mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, individuals familiar with the situation reported, UEFA did not have a preliminary discussion with SCW about Neymar's transfer.
They had contact with Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the provision of SCW.
According to the latest published accounts, between 2015 and 2016, SCW received more than 10 million euros at a turnover rate of Euro542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
The KPW expects Neymar's arrival to be an enabling ground for sponsorship, the sale of attributes and t-shirts with the team logo.
In the club, it is assumed that turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
No doubt angry by leaving one of the best football players, the Spanish league tried to stop Neymar's transfer, saying that the SCW would break the financial Fair Play.
"This is the obvious case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the Spanish newspaper "AS" by President La League Javier Tebas, in view of Qatar's ultimate owner.
Arsenala coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnesium, shares La League's doubts about government funding for the club.
"It's all the consequences of a good engagement, and it's completely changed the football landscape in the last 15 years," announced on Thursday, Wenger.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is becoming very difficult to keep up with financial fairy-players because the country can have many ways and many reasons for being represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the manner and place of the oath
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation, the President will decide - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have developed a committee of the State Duma on legislation and State-building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to determine directly the manner in which the oath was brought into law.
The solemn oath will exempt children under 18 years of age, as well as those who are incapable, from the finalized text of the amendments to the Russian Nationality Bill (at the disposal of the "Eztomy") which the Committee will consider on 11 July before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported on 6 June during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Viacheslav Volodyna, on the occasion of his accession to Russian citizenship.
The deputies introduced this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the repeal of the decision to grant citizenship to those subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, public calls for terrorism or public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, art. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of aircraft, trains or water transport, but only if the act involves terrorism (art. 211, art. 4 of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was that, in the form of documents for citizenship, a person was bound by a promise to comply with Russian legislation - to put extremism on the road, and he violated that promise.
In April, the draft law was introduced to the State by the leaders of Vladimir Vasiliev (the only Russian Federation), Gennadius ZÃ¼ganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (the "fair Russia") and Speaker of the DG VÃ¤Äeslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been revised once again.
It now states that the procedure for swearing in will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Previously, parliamentarians were about to describe the procedure directly in the Citizenship Act of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State Serb and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event was to take place, a list of places where a Russian herb could be placed, was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, heads of State bodies, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the U.S.A.s.
To make a solemn pledge to those who wish to acquire Russian citizenship will be made after officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport of a person will only be obtained after the oath comes from a finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from 18 years instead of 14 years.
The rule in which the oath of oath would be discharged by incapable or limited legal capacity, as well as by those who could not deliver, read or handwrittenly sign the oath text, was maintained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons,"
The amended bill also lays down a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine who are considered Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a declaration to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A waiver of "other" nationality would not be required, as it is now, if provided by an international treaty or if it is not "for reasons beyond the control of the person."
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the First Vice-Speaker, DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklon, Pavel Krashinnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all "One Russia").
I think many of you know that it's impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Consequently, many people are awaiting a solution to their fate about Russian citizenship, explained the day before the head of the thought committee on State Construction and Law, Paul Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who in writing refused "other" citizenship and handed over the previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but "for reasons beyond its control" would not cease to be a national of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, being hired to work in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual nationality or residence permit of another country cannot become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is envisaged that the law should enter into force on 1 September 2017 and that the necessary regulations should be prepared by that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in the American summer Jark and Detective's Warehouse.
The current history is nostalgic at the same time as the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; the era of the grandge in the 1990s (about the time when prominent masters David Wayne and Michael Schvalter made a comedy of the "State" sketches for MTV); and themselves - that is, in 2001, before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Radd moved to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is at the same time the height and the embodiment of our era, with its constant reminders from Faisbuk.
But as a franchise, she seems anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking vegetable bank called H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached the age of majority; thus, the inability to return becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, have less emotional roots, and its patheticness is more unsystematic and includes riffs from the steel films of the 1990s, such as the "Rooking Cradles."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled rollers, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
A lot of plot moves are the same.
Good Cup, now writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't broken up with virginity.
And there's also a crazy and mean conspiracy that Ronald Reagan is involved in, which George Bush is now inciting.
As always, the best part of the franchise is a departure from it.
It's particularly fun to see the eternal young Radd who sings Matt Dillon's song from "The One," whose character, former big man Andy, looks old now.
This franchise could be successful by random madness in the spirit of "Seven Up" recursive series until it comes to what I think would be its logical conclusion: "A hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last scene the whole company would go to a movie at the premiere film "The Horrible American Summer."
Comrade Detective in the Amazon comes to another kind of nostalgia: memories of the cold war from the Americans, the blast blonde, or even "Blesska" with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheistism and Marxist Lenin Road.
The main roles - which was seen by Gregor and the idealist Josef - are played by Florin Pierresik Jr. and Corneliu UliÄ, and their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levy.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (police spend time watching the chess game, how Americans could watch football).
A team of famous votes for the cadrum, including Jenny Slat, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Seminyi, makes it interesting to play "gay the voice."
But Comrade Detective's holding on to the truth of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - which often looks like her.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not very funny and often.
If it were to be quicker, the Comrade Detective could better deal with his agitprop satire; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American Embassy, two fat people are sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
The imaginary communist star says that Western culture is capable of making a fathead out of anything.
The Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund for Russia's Super Bowl football between Spartacus and Lockomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Prime League (FRPL) Sergei Pstovkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the FRFL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that, to date, there were almost no tickets to the match.
The Spartacus-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30 p.m.
According to TASS, Spartacus is the current Russian Federation champion, and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young hustlers cleaned the furniture cage for 200,000 rubles.
A 37-year-old scientist with a furniture firm approached the police the other day.
The man claimed the theft of expensive tools from the zech, causing serious damage to its production.
Producing thieves has become instruments worth almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, perforator, hydravlica, swan.
The guards began to search for criminals and soon came to the people of the Bashkortostan Bashkortostan area of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the accomplices entered the premises of the enterprise, hacked the front door and delivered the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first car service to get hit.
They have already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement officers have been able to recover only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on the words of the United States of America and the Russian Federation.
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of State Detective Heather Nauert, in response to the statements made by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, concerning the relations between the two States.
Previously, the head of the Russian Government stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
In commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a low level, but noted that there was a need to look for "cooperative areas."
"Look at the truce in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," quoted by the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions amounted to a commercial war.
The new sanctions bill against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on the previous Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior raised roses from ametrists and quarks
The village unit of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new rings and three choker rings on velvet tapes.
In the Rose Dior PrÃ© Catelan line, two new rings and alumni, pink quarry and diamonds were released in gliptic techniques (hand-cuffing on stone) and a pasta dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Viktoire de CastellÃ¡n was inspired by the roses that had grown in his place in Granville by modeler Christian Dior, and by the Paris Gardens Bagtel and Pre-Katelan.
Tramp found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a sharp criticism of the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"Can you thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote Twitter.
On the eve, Donald Trump signed the new sanctions law against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They are particularly affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the US to make profitable deals and would further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Procopene, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) a request for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman's decision explained to RBC the intention to focus on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on.
According to Mr. Procopeni, such a move would be a "best investment of time" despite the investment appeal of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Procopene became the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the consortium NorvikBank Grigori Guzellnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gucetoria.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Porosenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, other than the UTB and the Winsconbank, became Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for blakemouth in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, the Russian Federation identified the reason for blakemouth in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, explained what had happened.
According to him, the peninsula remained without electricity due to the accident in Krasnodar province.
The truck in the accident cut off the power lines, resulting in the dismantling of the Cuban and associated Crimean networks.
The power failures of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists removed the trouble for hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the bracelet could have been abnormal heat.
Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakened inflation have caused rumors of possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain elusive and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family incomes.
The experts of the Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 against 2 for maintaining rates of 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of committee members this month in favour of increasing the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that rising rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the bracesite inflation, and stated that it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be higher than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of bracesite.
Since next February, the bank will close the emergency funding plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he reported that he was now expected to provide another 15 billion pounds - up to 115 billion pounds - under this plan.
In the decision-making protocol, the bank said: "In agreement with the main projections of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption."
On the question of rates, he reiterated that a "some tightening of financial policies" would be necessary in order to halt inflation, in "a little larger" size than markets expected.
At present, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be "simplistic" and "limited."
Bank projections for promotion this year and the following year are lower than projections made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank left its forecast unchanged by 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after recent unsatisfactory growth rates had weakened the expectation of an increase; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the bank representative, growth appears to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank ' s last report on inflation gave little reason for the joy of households that had been hit by high inflation and very little wage increases: according to the bank, pressure would increase before falling.
The Bank added that financial policy "can't prevent" earnings in the next few years, but expects that wages will be restored "significantly" by the end of his three-year forecast.
The economy is also determined to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods due to the low pound rate, which compensates part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was taken one year after the rate was reduced to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of the EU exit referendum, which led to a fall in the pound.
According to bank estimates, it is likely that four years will be required to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision at the rates, there was a growing noise around the anticipated increase in rates, as inflation was increasingly pressured on households that were already under pressure: three committee specialists asked to raise the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and was again offset in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure than the planned 2 per cent is entirely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco's Iot Brokers, said, "If you consider the recent drop in Swap courses, it seems that the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as the refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of the absence of a commission, and with a low rate, is more popular than ever."
The Public Health Service will record a disputed HIV drug of 100,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" drug to prevent HIV after the battle in the High Court on financing the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposition HIV prevention (PEP), pre-sex pill, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the Health Service during the initial three-year trial period of approximately 100,000 persons.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ' s ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay PREP despite its claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was called "the most important innovation" by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National Agency for AIDS Control (NAT) called it "the turning point."
Prior to the full launch of the program all over England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more dispensaries will join the programme in October.
Prepositional prevention (PPE) is a course of pre-sex HIV drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
At the time of PREP's adoption before sex in a human body, enough specific drugs are available to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be used daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender persons and people whose partners are HIV-positive and not receiving successful treatment.
The dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender persons and persons whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a doctor of general practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Hungarian dispensary participating in the programme.
The program will cost Â£10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug security contract this week after the international tender.
The study is designed to assess all the potentials of PPEs by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its suitability and its use on a large scale.
"This essential innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone for more than three decades in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Debora Gold, president of NAT (National Agency for AIDS Control), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEP, if properly targeted to people in need of assistance and at risk, is an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk of HIV will have access to a new, new opportunity that a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to many, many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Greene, president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now, first of all, care must be taken to ensure that the test is fast-tracked throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups is forgotten.
Now that we're equipped with a PPE experimental drug, we're going to protect more than 100,000 people in the HIV risk zone."
Sharon Hodgeson, the shadow minister of public health, said: "We very much welcome the start of the PRE test, it has been very late for months of delays and delays by the Government."
Data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the PPE.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people at risk of HIV and move us even further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tartarstan and Russia Treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a pre-established form of organization of supreme State authority in the Republic, expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a power-sharing treaty between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "have played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
We recall the agreement between Moscow and Kazanyu that had been in force since 24 July 2007 for 10 years.
On 11 July, members of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of the post of head of the region.
At present, Tatarstan is the only federal entity with a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only post called "President."
In Russia, difficulties have arisen in obtaining international driving rights.
HYDDD units lack international driving permits (IEDs).
In order to obtain such rights, it has to wait a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to travel abroad on their own car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The IED was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are laid down in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on a specific police or rental office: some require an IED, and others have enough national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers of international law do, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratification countries (e.g. USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IEDs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all units of HYDDD, reporting to Kommersant ' by conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, vouchers are simply not issued in the units of HYGARD, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can sign up on the public service website, but it's already been extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IEDs cannot be "for technical reasons" without details, but in Samara province, they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation in other cities.
Many mosquitoes have already faced the problem, and social media are increasingly becoming such messages:
Irina Burmistrova: " Guess why no international law can be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, 'cause all HYDPD offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to people who know!"
International law needs to be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, it's always a long way forward, and there's no ticket at all (there's a button, but there's no ticket).
I think the public service portal shows that Spb is free to go.
Has anyone tried to get to another town?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permit forms have changed, and new forms are being supplied to the units of the State Administration.
This may be the result of a deficit, but it is not clear what changes have been made, nor has this been reported before.
Blancie buys the Special Purpose Centre for Road Safety (CSN) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then brings them to the units of HICD.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Gonznak: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IED forms were produced, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was entered into on 18 July with the First Printing Palace Service for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the CSN just didn't get to hold a tender in time, and that's why there's a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently, not to Europe, but to the cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not yet clear, so people are reinsurance, so there is also a burning demand for international "browns."
Recently, it has become known that professional drivers will have to pass the qualification test.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The new model international driving permit (IED) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said on Friday, 4 August, in an interview with the "Audient" portal.
No respectable international company would even throw a bolt or chauffeur there because it risked losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that had joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"There is, in my deep conviction, no prospect of this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considered Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build smaller objects.
I know that since the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"So I think the best instrument in this situation - sanctions against companies that were so short-sighted to join the project" - was noted by the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a set of road arches of the Crimean Bridge.
A large assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed on the Kerchensk bank, with its assembly closed at 45 metres from the base of the construction.
"On a daily basis, the engineers prepared for the installation of the railway arch on the fairway supports," reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maksim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the site was proceeding ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Province.
In Spain, a civil servant who had not been employed for 10 years was fired.
What kind of angel patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was the head of Spanish official Carles Recio?
Permanent walk lasted 10 years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not his immediate boss.
What isn't happening in the world of bureaucrats?
The practitioners seem to have been used to all the people's services for a long time.
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the Sensation complained from Spain.
There, Valencia Carles Recio's archive officer managed to stay out of work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular salary.
And all the solids are 50,000 euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's "good times" are over.
He was fired by decision of the Valencia Legislature.
In the investigation, it turns out that an evil walker went to the office every morning at 0700 hours to celebrate in the electronic system.
And then I went home.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00 to celebrate again in the system that he had left.
That's 10 years old.
It has also become known that the walker spent all his free time trying to paint comic books at home.
Members of the Valencia legislature now think of how to punish Mr. Recio's direct chief, who could not have known how to "work actively" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are offered protection from the Presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRA proposes to limit the powers of the presiding officers of the courts and to introduce their selection.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be attached to the federal administrative and territorial branch.
The Supreme Court should also present its proposals within the framework of the presidential order.
The HRA has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was commissioned by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017 by the President after meeting with the members of the council.
In a meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public control in public detention facilities (see "J" of 9 December).
The work of the HRA resulted in 25 proposals, both on the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as on the financing of courts and legal education.
One idea of cremlevian human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If the candidate for the position of a judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judiciary, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the HR Committee, must present him for appointment without having the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to assign cases to judges.
Do it, allow experts, can use a specially written computer program.
Also, the HRS considers that the President is not entitled "to predetermine the results of the judicial qualification, initiate disciplinary proceedings and decide on additional entitlements."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "election of the judges themselves" and "Encourage their powers for a relatively short period of time with compulsory rotation."
All the presidents of the courts (from the Republican to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRS proposes to re-establish appeal and cassation in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the federal administrative and territorial office.
The HRS says that "it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the district level in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation but in the judicial districts."
Experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have "judicial districts" which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which, by doing so, guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are constrained by the use of telephone law.
The World Judges of the HRS suggest that the people ' s sittings be strengthened to deal with some "civil and administrative categories" with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained "J" by a member of the SHRC, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morvovska.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only to the HRC but also to the Supreme Court, which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time to execute an assignment from the Office of the Procurator-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, President VC Viacheslav Lebedev is due until 1 September.
To live a high life: half-ethage and sneaky designers turned this little apartment into a flat in Earls Court.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a simple house in Naitsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful model house in the style of Queen Anna, and in favour of a new design says Joan didn't pack her stuff or move again.
"I lived with my ex in Nightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceiling.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first view, 1,000 square feet of flat has been completely reconstructed.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom complex planning - to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and semi-ethage in order to derive maximum benefit from the generous height of the ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my claim." She says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Norting Hill architectural and dysair studio Duck & Shed to use 12.5 feet high and create a housing that would not only be a successful project, but would fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two premises one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-ethage that could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brif.
"The work with steel structures is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to set up the premises so that they could be one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to overwhelm the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed the use of spaces above and below."
This decision allowed Erfan to have two full rooms one above the other in the space - and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-enthage through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens the view on the great living room downstairs.
Green furniture with a gold separation, silver accents and rifle lighting devices from Serge Muya are making a project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding sight, simplicity and light.
The short corridor is marked with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protection panel looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
In order to create a sense of more luxury space, the beauty of the living room can cover the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the new kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a moving door, like in the garage.
"The engineering art has been used here," Earfan tells us about the armed steel of a wooden-wave shield door.
"It's counterweighted, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to slip."
With the reasonable use of storage space and facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, the floor area is exactly what you're selling, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be," says Erfan.
"The real estate dealer will come in and make calculations on the basis of the floor area."
Here, they were able to increase the area of the floor by using quality materials that give the space the shades of luxury.
"Materials are what we're touching, so they help create emotional connections with the house," said Erfan.
"No one falls in love with electric wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts."
This shows that, with a good design and an extended mesh, an apartment can turn from something normal to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Government of Russia has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The order was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission ' s main task would be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission has been appointed Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Bearev, approved a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy by 2030 in 2016.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries declined to eight years minimum
The increase in consumer prices in G20 countries has been reduced to the minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent, lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat previously reported a reduction of 0.1 per cent in the consumer price index in Russia.
Thus, the agency recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The price of inflation in Russia is calculated at 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - in the case of the agency, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal Taiga
The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, warned against the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donski, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It allows deforestation during fire fires, and the Government plans to take it in the fall.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored to ensure that the process of clearing "is not cut out in a row."
Donsk noted that the draft law included monitoring by the MES and the supervisory agencies.
Media: VSU fighters secretly agree with the Donbass militia
On the line of armed confrontation, a regular telephone service has been established in Donbass.
Fighters of the warring parties are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The U.S. soldiers and the Donbass militia have established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
This was reported on 4 August by Strana.ua, referring to the members of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publications, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their counterparts on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis.
Communication is not domestic: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements."
A simple result of such conversations is a truce on a certain front.
Journalists were aware of cases in which the congratulations on the birthday of an officer had been received from his or her formal enemy because of the front line.
The U.S.S. and MD. and LP. militia have been in the trenches on the line of distinction since spring 2014 when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has messed up the blocking of statements by the United Nations Office at Geneva concerning attacks against the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
The Russian foreign policy agency is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives that block the statements of the United Nations Sovbes in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The office recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August had been subjected to mortar fire by terrorists from the Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Filak al-Rahman during the month.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimous in the characterization of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime call for opposition to this structure, the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that "there would certainly be no ambiguity in the terrorist attacks of Nusra."
However, as stressed in the diplomatic community, "the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine on the UN Security Council alternately, turning the tone of objections into arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement to the press condemning terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should rest on the conscience of those delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the Security Council's failure to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to engage in new provocations and terrors, gives them a sense of impunity," stated to the MD and added that "I would not like those barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin argued for limiting the number of unscheduled business checks
Russia's President Vladimir Putin, during an investment project meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of unannounced checks of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned ones, as well as the need to limit the duration of inspections to 10 ducks.
"Unscheduled checks are generally carried out without appropriate coordination with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2-3 per cent is agreed to by the Public Prosecutor's Office and everything else goes on its own," quoted by the President of the TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, in the President ' s view, business cohesion should be given the right to defend the interests of its members in court.
"This, I hope, will give some positive effect to business-related or business-related offences," said the Head of State.
The JO reported that the moratorium on planning checks has led to an increase in the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, a survey was commissioned by the Russian President, Boris Titova, which revealed that there had actually been a substitution of routine checks (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as checks on citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More about business checks in "J" for small business on the other side.
Brothers fight for a real estate empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million - 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
The former director of Carlton's football club and the builder Colin de Lutis live in Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who sued the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court still has a fierce dispute about the terms of divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, brothers have owned 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Kollingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the family ' s list of De Lutis ' s property now includes office buildings, sections under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller and trade centres in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father Colin, who Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful reconciliation attempts, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, from which Paul thought Colin had excluded it.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he said he hoped to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenses are growing as snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been involved in the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including the Royal Counsel of Allan Myers, and the best ones.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they managed dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store at Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years) ."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to transfer their property to sons without conflict.
"Louigi often told me that she didn't want the brothers to deal with the trial," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lucis company group; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he got out of business, and Luke got 26 million.
Paul and Luke said that Mark were "not satisfied with the financial conditions of his office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul on Friday and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered a text message stating that, since the case has not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and break the name of our family in court," he wrote.
Colin wrote in mid-2016 that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "there is still hope for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have spread out.
"The decision on our case will soon be brought to trial," Colin wrote.
The new Chief of Staff, Trump, is planning to limit the flow of information to the President.
Others tried to do that and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
In that case, he'll be first.
Politicalo reports that the new head of the White House apparatus is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the Chief calm.
That's what Josh Douzi's reporter says.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the chief of staff on his first day of work, he identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it, in paper form or through briefings, because the president would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite true, but others have already failed in trying to reconcile Trump by tracking the flow of information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television began decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received fair coverage in the publications that could be reconvinced," said politicalo in February, Sam Nanberg, a former electoral officer.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that "in the words of six former members of the electoral headquarters to control Trump's habit of Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that his personal information was kept at a constant rate of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know - for example, if it weren't for them, Trump's Twitter would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff had saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts had not been wasted.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House divided into rival factions, people constantly try to move their agenda forward by giving Trump material - reliable or non - that confirms their views.
Politico, just to this story, wrote in May about the tendency of the advisers to keep the President informed on an ongoing basis.
Here's one example described by Shein Goldmacher's reporter:
"The late and former Tramp officers say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone planted an article with GotNews.com on Charles C. Johnson's Internet promoter's website, in which Katie Wells' deputy chief of staff was accused of "staying a few leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson's always been lost on Twitter for aggressive behaviour, that he didn't present specific facts or that in the past he had launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Wells."
Goldmaher adds that the then Chief of Staff, Rains Pribus, and the Secretary of the Rob Porter's office, "was trying to build a system to control and document the flow of the papers that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
Maybe he'll be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his assistants still fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The prison prosecutor's office is fighting an HIV examiner.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the decision of the Kalininian Court of TÃ¼meni, which ended the criminal proceedings against a local resident who had died of HIV from a minor daughter.
The result is that the child was killed because the mother was HIV-positive and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV-seekers.
The case against a resident of Tumeni was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (the cause of death by negligence), in April, after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection 4B.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother is HIV-positive.
"The woman wasn't treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," explained in the Tumenian Public Prosecutor's Office.
The criminal case came to the Kalininian Court of TÃ¼meni, which decided to terminate it on 25 July.
The father of the deceased girl applied for this, explaining that "he has forgiven his wife, has no claim to her, she has caused harm and apology."
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and filed an appeal requesting that the decision to discontinue the case be quashed and referred to a new hearing.
The girl died and the harm caused by the crime could not be solved.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the doctors' recommendations, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection," reported to the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In the opinion of the oversight body, she should be punished, or other HIV-seekers would follow her example.
As reported at the Tumen AIDS Centre, some 12 children living with HIV are currently not receiving health care due to the refusal of parents in the Tumen region.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV have changed their opinion - have allowed diagnosis, medication to be taken," told the press secretary of the AIDS Centre, Elena Losev.
She said that it was impossible to legally influence parents, and as a result not all HIV-positive children were found, mothers were not allowed to examine them, hide them, and run away with children from hospitals.
What risks HIV-seekers face
At the end of last year, the Petrburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV-seekers are referred to as people who deny HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Medicalians and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and their spread is seen as a serious threat.
The creepy photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August at the Greek railway station in Khmelnitzk.
A fun company of young people who got drunk was walking a bridge over the railway tracks, where the freight train was standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective selfie on the roof of the wagon, reported to the "ACTAM" in the police communications sector in the Khmelnitz region.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but due to his indiscretion, he caught the power line and got a shock at the moment.
Fortunately, the station's dispatcher, who immediately called the emergency, became aware of this case.
Prior to the arrival of the victim ' s doctors, he was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in a burn room at the Helsinki Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with torso burns 1 - 2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that there has been an increasing popularity of extreme silphies on the roofs of multi-ethage bridges, transport-driven bridges.
The police call on people to be vigilant and not to allow such photographs, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There could be oceans on ancient Venus.
French scientists made such an assumption.
The specialists created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the planet's surface, writes Science News.
It turns out that at Venus at the beginning of its history, there were oceans with 10% more water than it was now on Earth.
Previously, the "Celebrities of the Week" wrote that, according to scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed 4 billion years ago on Mars.
In the course of their research, foreign experts concluded that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in the San Francisco Park as a result of the shooting
In San Francisco, three people were injured by the shooting, handing over Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a large number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began to scream threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting people.
The appearance of the wrongdoers could not be considered because they had closed everything but their eyes.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, and there is no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured while shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.

The Louna rock band will present a new album in Barnaul.
The Louna rock concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
Musicians will present their new album, "Dive New World," which became one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The collective is preparing a concept show that will be the most visible in the band's concert history.
"Dive New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the famous novel antootopia, O. Huxley, "O wonderful new world."
The new songs do not rewrite the book, but they talk about a society that lives according to the anti-Utopia law, "distinguishing the wind of propaganda and imposed values."
The band was supported by more than 1,200 people on the Planeta.ru website to collect the money for recording the album.
My first album, "Do the Thunder!" Louna released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the film "Time X" and recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013) in 2013.
In the fall of 2015, the Louna band performed a symphonic orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with the Songs of Peace programme.
In the Luzinee Gevorkiyan (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (Bas guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (gitar), Sergei Poncratyev (gitar), Leonid Kinsbourski (barabana).
The concert will take place at the Faraon Barnauli Club on October 17, 1900.
The price of tickets is 1,200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the requested groups on the Russian rock scene.
The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band won a number of hits of the Dujin Fucking Parade on various occasions.
The Gypsies have overcome the rudders and have returned to the millions' street.
Some of the richest West Midland landlords are once again in conflict with the strong gypsies who have overcome the crows of the municipal authorities in order to retake the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering on the rich street of Solihall, which received a ridiculous name called the millionaires' street.
By bringing horses, babies and lots of houses on wheels, they returned after being expelled no further than in May, and they were not prevented from being rude by municipal authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in defensive structures and pulled its vehicles through a section that was left ungrateful to leave a place for the tropics.
The angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that he was "unable to solve this problem."
Anonymous local woman said, "They came here on Monday night after they were driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones in the skies."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are completely unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were kicked out, and they came back again.
More Gypsies arrived last night, and perhaps even more today.
"the municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Stritsbrook Road, and I don't like the fact that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
One local man who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and please, this attack continues."
There's more of them this time, and we've even seen a horse fall on the grass."
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Stritsbrook Road and cooperate with the Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to chase them away as soon as possible."
In order to help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police on phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
The rat is fixing a champagne wine factory called the New World.
The Ministry of the Republic of Crimea, the " New Light Champagne Wine " , has decided to amend the " New Light Champagne Wins " into the OAO, following the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's state of affairs.
The statutory capital of the stock society would amount to 5,55.5 million roubles and would consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
Crimea ' s Ministry of Agriculture stated that if funds were not available for the modernization of the plant in the next three years, the plant would be at risk of being stopped.
The value of the plant ' s major assets is around 60-70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles, and due to the nature of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"To get money from the owner is problematic, to talk about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations is difficult," said the head of the minselhoza Crimea Sergei Petelin in April of this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the projected privatization plan for 2017.
It was suggested that it be arranged and put on bidding.
The source of the Interfax in the Crimea authorities estimated the possible value of the sale of the enterprise of $40 million, and the investment of the investor in the modernization of $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of game wine by 2.8 per cent from the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lv Holitsin as a factory for the production of a game wine in his New World name.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The lower-urban third graders have destroyed more than 40 gravestones.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs officials in the lower-urban region identified the identity of citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the town of Lukkovo.
The third-class students were evil-minded.
The first claim that the gravestones were damaged by unknown persons was submitted to the Russian MOWD on 27 June in the Lykkovsk region.
A total of 24 persons have been contacted by the police.
As a result, criminal proceedings were instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, "Device, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, the police identified suspects and found two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching monuments fall, and that led them to hooligan acts.
Prevention measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone towards the ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
"If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," the Minister of the Interior, Mario Minniti, said in an interview with the Torin daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti's warning was issued the following day after Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that his crew actually cooperated with traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for a year, had refused to comment on the substance of the detailed allegations made against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogjo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue to operate in the search and rescue zone" states the statement of the organization on social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges that have been made now, only after we gather all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Uwenta vessel belonging to Jugend Rette since October.
His crew is suspected of being taken on board by a whole lifeboat by migrants whom traffickers sent directly to them and allowed smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as alleged in the prosecution file published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coast authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather from humanitarian vomiting than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes primarily that courts of the Uventa type will have a staff member of the Italian police on board who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Pro-Activa Rasprostery Aggregation from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not cause any "significant change or interference" in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning MÃ©decins sans frontiÃ¨res (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support Libyan coast guards and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The Russian Federation authorities have recently significantly intensified their Libyan policy and, with visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been involved.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal settlement of the Russian Federation ' s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Daygov, said "JO" what the objectives were for Moscow in the region and who was being held.
The contact group on Libya, which you are leading, is hardly known.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows about it.
And here's a cover of secrets.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the FF and the State Duma.
Her activities are supervised by the Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov.
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan track by the Speaker of the State Duma, Viacheslav Volodyna.
The arrest in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanique Chebotarev (in September 2015, 11 persons were on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group was established from military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, and our work was supported by Chechini Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it work out that you were the one who led her?
Since I've been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to lead the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of seafarers from the Chebotareva Mechanica.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and Tripoli (where the recognized United Nations Government led by Faiz Saraj - JO) and Tobrouk (Parliament's resolution opposing the Government and supporting Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya. - JO).
With the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (the Libyan Prime Minister - JO), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian seafarers.
It was then agreed that a contact group should be established to make better use of these contacts.
Its mission is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in a dialogue with all of us.
How many of them are in a contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now has five members.
Among them are people with experience in power structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to join the regional team of specialists, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of RAN.
None of our staff is permanently in Libya, and that is not necessary.
Whether there are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, whose side is it?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But in your contact group, ex-military members are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point for us, such as Misurata (where militias are based, playing a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi in 2011 and which have increased markedly in the years to come).
We arrived in Misoratu in January of this year.
We were scared, said it was Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation on our own, to analyse the real military potential for which we are responsible, why there are rumors like the role of Islamists there.
In Misurath, we met with all the members of the units that were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the militants of the banned "Islamic State" in Russia, "JO."
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to check that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of the IH in Libya, not the Khalifa Haftar who attributed this to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Islamic State" in Libya didn't win Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was operating on another front, Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte fought the structures under the authority of the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, in Doum, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardia.
We understand that you are in all Libyan regions and that you are likely to imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the holding of the elections that took place at the end of July in Paris, Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
The fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting has become a good signal to us has not been possible for so long.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And with regard to Russia's position...
Often they write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board that day by the Russian air carrier Admiral Kuznets.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurath, they didn't believe in a coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our challenge is to show that we do not support just Haftara, we are engaged in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to learn twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian, if he knows, very relatively.
But the fact that he taught us makes it easier for us to have a dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurath, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And that's how they speak Russian.
And they reach Russia, to some extent they have nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the possible immediate lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They're interested, of course, but, as I said, we don't take sides in this conflict and we don't want to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in some equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans have consistently called for Russia to contribute to its withdrawal.
The constitution-making process is now well under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions, achieve internal consensus.
The elections should then take place, as was the case at Saraja and Haftara's meeting.
If the elections are to take place and the legitimate power is finally elected (and now none of the parties has that status), the withdrawal of the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations Sovbes.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, which will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
On the other hand, it has been reported in the media that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees coming from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the Haftara troops taking control of the coasts and putting an end to the smuggling business of immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
Italians need Russia's support because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the south.
In this regard, tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
It's about Southers breaking the flow of migrants in far-reaching approaches?
So, conditionally, they turned back the buses in which Nigerian migrants went?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in continuing these flows.
We hope to work towards bringing the South together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and tribes in the south.
But, first of all, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical is he?
Would this be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but it is his own position that Libya must be a completely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to peace.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by countries that were not interested in Russia ' s contact with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, and there is a legislative, executive and judicial power.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed up all the cards and started active communication with both Tripoli and Tobruck.
We are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State Oil Company, the NOC.
The director of the NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosnepht.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll sell it over.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
In plans to resubmit the contracts entered into at Muammar Qadhafi.
These include earlier transport arrangements (rail construction), energy (electricification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, is this about the "oil-for-service" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is gonna be, I don't have to deal directly with these questions.
In fact, Russia's economy in Libya is not important.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
It is important for us to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to negotiate among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya will cease to be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task of helping the Libyan people and putting terrorists out of there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, no Russian and other countries of the former USSR are there.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records from Islamist and radical groups (in Libya).
Which of the States then are these fighters?
I wouldn't want to go into that detail.
Then let's make the question different.
How many Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, not more than 5 per cent.
The rest are the messengers.
Can Moscow negotiate intra-Lebanese negotiations on Paris's example?
There's plans like that.
We have been engaged in intensive negotiations with Libyans, several Libyan delegations have already visited Moscow, and we have indicated our readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are still due, and I hope that there will be clarity about the timing and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity raised money for a expensive gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Mazola, who has a CDC, a brain hydrocephalia and a total blindness, will receive a special runway on 5 August.
The Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosarev, and the Director of the Constantin Bobkov Museum, provide a useful presentation to Sasha.
The money for the gym was collected during the charity marathon, "Don't be tired of doing good," which took place in Melichov on 15 July on Chekov's Day of Remembrance.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, I received a letter from Sasha living in the village of Manushkino of the Czech region, saying, "I don't see any eyes at all, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runway to make my legs strong, and I'd learn a little bit to walk."
And Sashaine's dream came true!
After being served in a museum, the Confert Postscriptum will be held, a famous pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Gindin will perform purri from popular classical works.
During the philanthropy marathon in Melichov, the choir of the Venesen Dawood Poustini, the callers of the Ilya Drozdihin workshop, the students of the Moscow Conservatory of P.I. Chaykovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesinov, the artists of the Melichov Theatre of the Chekhov Studio were present.
An auction was held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with a marathon logo were organized.
The Melichovo Museum took the initiative to make Chekov Memorial Day on 15 July a single charity day in all the Podmoskov Museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Gitomir region, near the local football stadium, shot several times towards the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was pissed off by the noise, reported to the "FACTAM" in the Gitomir District Police Communications Department.
After that, a man went to a cafe nearby.
He had a conflict in the building, during which a man had used a rubber bullets machine, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, and his life was not threatened.
Police officers and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified his identity and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device to shoot rubber bullets sent for forensics.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 of the Criminal Code.
The detainee faces a prison sentence of 3 to 7 years.
Remember, in Kiev, a shooting attack took place on Lucyanovka in the street of Tatar on the night of 28 July.
Conrad Roy was sentenced to death by Michelle Carter for reports.
Massacuse's resident was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearings on Thursday, "My family was killed in grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at large until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, burning her hands and emptying her eyes.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor stated to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her life.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant impact on her actions."
The Prosecutor read statements from Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying: "No day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was obsessed with the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunts.
"Lucking the man who's been with me ever since my birth is the pain that's gonna stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case would appear to be a legal precedent, since there was no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case brought to the attention of the whole country when it became known that Carter's message had been pushed to suicide.
"Can you hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how to do it," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before he died when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she was suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and he banned her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published his special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prisons."
Eugene Bogchev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight."
One of the best basketball players in the Single League of the World Bank is the 33-year-old Keith Langford who left the NECS.
The departure of U.S. Advocates of the News commented on the President of INCNSA, Evgeny Bogchev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, told Eugene Bogchev.
He has a little baby, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in INCNSA and showed a high level in every match, all 100 percent.
So I let him go like a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played at the Kazakh club for three years, winning silver from the Single League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he was awarded the award to the most effective player in the Eurolig season.
He scored 21.75 points on average for the match.
This result has been the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Eurolig's history to receive the prize more than once.
Langford will shortly sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, inform Eurohops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second European star in July to go to the Chinese championship.
Previously on Chinese CBA, Jannis Bourusis moved the ex-centre Panatinaikos.
A sun-burned tourist from Podmoskovia was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigae
The Adageian rescuemen were being evacuated today by helicopter from the mountainous region of the Republic by a sub-moscal tourist who received the strongest solar burns.
The man was resting at the Fisth shelter, which is at a height of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, and breathing was also difficult.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The captain of the tour team approached the rescue team, who told them that the burns had been made by the man in the camp.
"Audi" is to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
One day prior to the announcement by Audi, BMW announced that it would offer software upgrades in over 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman stated that the company considered that "there were more intelligent routes than driving restrictions" with regard to European cities, including Munich, where BMW was located, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel vehicles.
"Dimler" said on Thursday that he was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a review.
European automobile manufacturers have actively promoted diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to improve compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered cancerogenics and may cause asthma.
The cost for motor manufacturers of equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust gas is also increasing, and it is difficult to maintain the competitive price of motor vehicles.
While German auto producers are under close scrutiny, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of following influential automobile manufacturers and ignoring signs of problem.
Companies try not to repeat Volkswagen's errors, which shut down the use of so-called "failment devices" that during testing could correct the quantity of harmful gases emitted to conform to the rules, and in normal driving conditions, they were shut off.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders were convicted and the others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested as part of the Audi engine development team.
The former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subjected to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to bypass European emission rules and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may pose serious problems to Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrahani, a coffee shop visitor paid false money.
The police received a report from a bank employee about the discovery of 5,000 roubles when the money was recalculated from the general public station.
A study carried out at the Centre for Scientific and Criminal Sciences showed that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, one of the visitors to the cafe who bought the chaurma was paid by bank note.
It should be noted that the cash register was not equipped with a means of determining the authenticity of the purchase.
At present, the police have identified persons involved in the construction and marketing of a known fake ticket to the Russian Federation ' s CB.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of the Astrahan region to be attentive to financial transactions; it is recommended that workers in trade facilities be equipped to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers found a "ad" planet where even iron can swim.
For the first time, after examining the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, the astrophysics were greatly surprised by its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
The experts noted that water molecules were so heated by the light of the star that infrared radiation was emitted.
The Hubble telescope sealed the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet shine in infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot tubs" - gas giants, by size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
As a result of this year, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas lining is almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the Lavand in Provence.
It has become the symbol of Provans and South France, but fears are now expressed that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda's growing worse because of dry weather and insect transmissions; this has led to constant headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CREPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "Lavanda in Provence is indeed in danger because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the fall of the rain have become much smaller.
It affects the life of the lavande.
And there are also small cicades that jump on leaves insects that transmit micro-bakteria; in a very dry weather, they get a lot."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavanda is not only attracted to vacationers; lavanade oil is very much needed in perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
That's why we have less parts of air oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improved water distribution and slowing of evaporation from soil, as well as plant spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water, and more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador Winter Universalidade 2019 met with the Kraslarian schoolgirls
The two-time hockey World Champion, Ambassador Winter University of 2019 Alexander Semin met with the starters of hockey and gave autographs to the fans the previous day.
The meeting was held at the Winter Universals 2019 in a thematic week devoted to cocktail hockey.
Any member of the tent could ride a horse at a site with artificial ice.
In addition, estafets, quiz and games were organized with the pranked souvenirs of student games, a dismemberment from the Aerobic Federation.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible at sports sites and stressed that the most important part of the early stages of learning was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
"It's great that there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the master of the Winter Universals 2019, where starters can directly ask the team coach questions," said the champion.
It will be noted that promoting student sports and a healthy way of life among red people helps the Ambassadors of the Winter Universal 2019.
The Universalization Shater will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reporting to the Zymni University Directorate 2019.
In Gosdepe, they commented on the words of Medvedev.
The official representative of the U.S. State Department, Heather Nauert, commented on the briefing by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, on the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found "to improve bilateral interaction."
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauert described Syria's Armistice Agreement.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Bear's assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, it certainly has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of the State.
Previously, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, the head of the Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
The bears also stated that the US sanctions would be in force for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the American "clean game" appellation, Trumpa, considers it to be.
The one who went missing in the Podmoskove was found in someone else's memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under very picky circumstances: he left the car salon to go to the bathroom.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
And I found Shamil on someone else's dad in Ramenski.
He was completely naked in his bathroom by the owner.
The Dagestan sportsman couldn't explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport went missing.
The identification of his identity helped him to report his missing person.
The medical personnel who were on the phone recorded a partial memory loss and brain injury from Khanmetov, reporting the Mash pub.
Maybe the athletes are waiting for other surprises.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil may have already visited his apartment, whose keys were also stolen from him.
July ' s oil revenues exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the July 2017 oil and gas revenues exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, reporting to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the ruble than the monthly average of June used for the valuation, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products at projected levels.
"The deviation of the federal oil and gas revenues from the monthly valuation, in accordance with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019, is projected at +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017." According to the Ministry of Finance report.
Thus, the total amount allocated to the purchase of foreign exchange on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 amounts to 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, daily foreign exchange purchases would amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during this period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange transactions on the organized bids of the Moscow Exchange on an even-handed basis during the trading day.
The acquisition of foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist underlines that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Members of the weekly Riodos newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or war-torn drug traffickers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to an office that had already thrown a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - no evidence, suspicion and internal feeling would be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of subjects that make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
Violence has not been overreacting, and more and more journalists have been killed in the country: according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, not less than 25 since President Henrico Pena Nieto assumed office in December 2012; 589 people have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, the founder of the Riodos, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is widespread - a large photograph of Valdes showing a middle finger, with the inscription "justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoza building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing shirts showing his smile, face in glasses or his firm punk.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, sleepless, paranoid.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office was organized in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated, according to the journalists ' protection committee.
As with most of the thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime killings each year, journalists ' killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed in grief, although they are much more dangerous around us now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, Ibarr says.
"It's really stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of 15 May, Valdes left Riodos' office in the capital of Culiacana.
He managed to pass only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corall was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name, which means "Twelfth river."
The shooter left in his car and broke it nearby.
Valdesa was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children left.
The rumors tend to go quickly to Culiacana.
But about Valdes, almost everything is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited in the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let's not say that every day in the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with two-storey drug muffins, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the state of the sea with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes knew very well about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by a feeling of guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder helped two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso LÃ³pez, a leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel fighting with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have pissed off the sons; the people alleged to have been gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were taken to kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story had been captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "I couldn't do journalism without touching the drug problem," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising.
Journalists liked that they were able to publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were encouraged to read about what no one else had dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodos received the prestigious Maria Morse Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for the courage to investigate Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it goes.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug deal in Sinaloa was "this way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rumpeviento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that you have on a journalist, either like that, or you're just making a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
Riodos' staff miss Waldes, a joker who fought like a truck in a port, a friend, a generous hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to stay alive.
They relied on his order.
He should always wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they're asking, did he lose his love for a single order?
His death made them doubt their calculations of how best to do his job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know about their wives, children, their legal business, and clandestine airfields for drug trafficking.
"These things were below the line," Bohorkes said.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-defense.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem is, the editor of the Riodos, AndrÃ©s Villareal, says that "the smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier" is happening.
Old rules, he and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak State institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodos gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to make cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadows of a tree of 104 degrees [40 degrees Celsius].
They were instructed by the state government to guard Riodos' office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Burjuz district of Culiakana.
Some journalists have asked half a joke whether these policemen are part of the 50 per cent of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the nearest Riodos issue, three main topics were considered.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of the former champion on the sides of Julio CÃ©sar Chavez.
They also had the disclosure of government spending concentrated in the Governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive Kuliacan restaurants, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been abducted or what happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew it was a favorite restaurant at the same time as drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, a number of PRI governors have been strongly accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at this restaurant, including when El Chapo's son Guzman slipped away from the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would be looking for Waldes column with the most reliable information about kidnapping.
"We'd already know what happened," 46-year-old Villareal says, for his artistic bodyization called "El Flaco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Waldes' office is now being used as a poster and striker warehouse to protest against the killing of journalists, because staff members have become someone they never thought to be: press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a local prosecutor ' s demonstration on another journalist the following morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of MichoacÃ¡n in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
That day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington trying to obtain international support for the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that she not be given any more tasks to cover the activities of the Government, fearing that anger would harm its objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its associates in the government and its indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalist, he wrote that reporters were not only killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they did so on orders from politicians and security services who conspired with organized crime.
The Artikulo 19 Press Protection Committee considers that half of the attacks against journalists were carried out last year under the orders of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everybody remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, they found a note allegedly written on the face of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboards and headphones were lying next to her cut-off head.
Some publications chose to close down as the newspaper El North in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of her correspondent, Miroslav Brich, in March.
Others continue to be "El Manyana" from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad JuÃ¡rez made a public appeal to drug cartels through a drafting article on the first page, entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they continue to see the dangers on the streets.
And sometimes they've been killed, as it appears, with a photographer, Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, together with four women, in an apartment in Mexico three months after running from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risky solutions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, midnight, when the last edition was ready for printing, Riodoza publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near Masatlan's resort town left 19 corpses confirmed.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
By sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news on Riodos' website via their mobile phone.
The next day, I had to redo the first page.
The sirens were pissed off, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the police guarding them were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
By sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was displayed on the whole of Sinaloa's view, Riodos officers continued his case.
"How can you think about shutting down, " said Bohorkes, "if the day Javier was killed, the practicalist asked me to send her outside to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, although he's a terrible one.
The researchers explained that the first found remains of an incredible creature, the size of the nosorog found by a Canadian miner, remained so well that the experts called it "My Lisa among the dinosaurs."
It remained so well that they could even determine that the color of his garlic skin was red-ished brown, and say that he had, in some way, a dark past.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as "the most well-maintained from Tireophor in the history of discovery and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world."
It's a fossil - a newly found copy of a nodozaur living in the middle of a small period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible well-being was stunned by researchers who call him "really wonderful."
This grassy tireophorus is the most well preserved fossil of this species in history, according to the articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at the Sancor mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He stumbled on something that seemed different from the rock's environment, and decided to look more carefully.
The minerals he discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, work has been carried out to locate an animal inside the earth's gloss with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,000 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the result can be demonstrated.
"It's just a little bit of a piss, and you can almost believe he's sleeping," told the lead author Caleb Brown, the researcher of the Royal Tyrrellian Paleontology Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most well preserved copies of dinosaurs, Mona Lisa, among dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, researchers discovered that it was grassy, even though it was covered by a pancier and resembled a walking tank, it appeared to have been exposed to significant risks from raft dinosaurs.
This powerful dinosaur pancier used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used protective equipment known as protective paint, which many animals today also use.
This would allow him to get in touch with the environment more quickly and avoid meeting the enemy, and experts say that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, 110 million years old, belonging to the Norwegian family, was widely covered in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirrellian Paleontological Museum.
The scientists have already studied the animal and given it the name Borealopelta markitelly in honor of the museum lab of Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours in his hasty excavation.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the cheques and pancier plates on his body.
They found a protective colour spread out by the protective method in the animal kingdom, which means the uppermost of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although protective colouring is very common, discovery has become unexpected because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur significantly exceeds the size of the present living animals with protective colours.
It may be assumed that this dinosaur was being hunted so heavily by carrot dinosaurs that evolution preferred the disguise of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colours - such as reindeer, zebras or armoured personnel carriers - are much smaller and more affordable, indicating that nodosauru had to fight for survival seriously.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur pancier shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mel Period were," said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur is also evidence that its skin should have been red-ished and brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the contents of his digestive tract, in order to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it slammed down the lung on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it was in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further into the land than they are now.
"This nodozavre is truly wonderful because it is fully covered by the remaining garlic skin, while at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the early melon period.
You don't really need to use imagination to recreate it, you just have to feel a little bit, and you can almost believe he's asleep."
A small period is an era when giant terods, rafty dinosaurs, standing on two legs, wandered around the Earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the tyrannosaur recs, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his threatening ancestors could hunt on a tyrophone.
These include acrocantosaurus, a monster with a length of 38 feet (1.5 metres) of six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified in the ole.
The material was found by Sean Fanck when he was working in a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum, it's the world's most well preserved tireophorus, along with the skin and the pancier, and it's intact, from the face to the femur bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch hips coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this grassy tireophorus was hard on what is now Canada until the spilled river took it to the high seas.
But dinosaur's underwater burial kept his pancier accurate to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular copy are so well preserved that the skin remains are still covered by the burgeoning pancier plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, the degree of preservation of the "red as a lottery gain."
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The skin remains are still covered by the burgeoning pancier plates that absorb the animal's skull.
His right front leg is pulled along the side, and five fingers on it are wrapped up.
I can count the scales on his head."
Michael Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents.
Michael Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia, then Odessa oblast in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did so without proof of his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on its YouTube channel with his performance.
Saakashvili addressed an event commemorating the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician referred to Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland, as well as to Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian migration service had deprived him of his nationality was learned by an ordinary politician while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former governor of Odessa District, Mikhail Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any questionnaires.
Weinziher and Olkhovic ' s investigation period extended until January
The pre-trial investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of Eugenia Olhovik and the head of the Tplus energy holding, Boris Weinziher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, an extension of the house arrest of the accused is being considered before the Basman Court.
The representative of the SC informed the meeting of the decision to extend the pretrial investigation last time.
"The complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to remove and examine a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation," the investigator stated.
He added that suspects regularly bribed Cami's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at not less than a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as former ZAO's head of the Complex Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodine, who was led by the Vimpelcom company until 5 September, handed over bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting maximum favourable tariffs on thermal and electrical power, as well as for creating favourable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodine fled the investigation and was declared a federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the depth of his soul.
Only a day after arriving in New York as part of a travel trip, St. Louis's crop sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on her phone.
She got into the post of someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Note that none of her tapes posted this information, puzzled, closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
There were a lot of user repeaters in her tape with @TheePharaah.
==Death==Reper from Big St. Louis covered the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spread in the street, where it would be four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death wasn't something new to her and her circle.
She postponed her phone, and later in the evening she went back to the tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father, the master of the poster, saying, "The police from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast, as a police officer stood before a group of protestors with a lazy dog.
In another video, another cop, she said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
"It's not a normal situation," according to his own memories, then Ferrel said.
"It's not like the murder we're used to, and we can call it typical.
At that moment, I felt a sign.
I was angry and crying."
She took the flight back and left home the next day.
When she landed at 11:00, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they'd both go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the subject of a new documentary entitled "Whose Streets?" which will be released on August 11th.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was going to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flower dress and sunflower, they remembered the conversation that had been held before this morning in countless times, "the experience of black people and their situation."
She remembers saying, "Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because the cop killed the 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't not take her," Ferrel said later.
"What's happening today is the culmination of what happened earlier.
She should know about it, see it and grow up on it.
It must not only be well understood as an asset and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their situation, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I got her out of it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made the first stop at South Florissant Road at a site across the street from a police station that was like a tent camp while activists were waiting for reports of the eventual non-incrimination of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected the bags and helped deliver them to the protestors.
A little bit in Ferrel's mind was shaped by a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noting that, as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Association of Sanitary Students, National Minorities, and was involved in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of the organizer.
It came by itself."
A few weeks later, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of his coroners at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferreer "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with a question, "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can play?"
This skepticism was brought by many people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and persistence.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already joined with his co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the death penalty.
His involvement has generated sympathy for the project with Ferrelle and six other local residents with whom the team of the Blue Street Project has maintained contact over the years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, it's what we say," said Davis.
"It was the most important thing for me, as these people will be represented, because it's what I'm gonna represent myself."
Although the project's objective was not to focus on Ferrel's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "it's not about the Savior Leader, but about how the community unites" as Folayan said, it was the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, there are unexpected personal aspects of Ferrelle's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
"But I knew that when you do this job and you humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's story is again discussing and emphasizing the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of Black Life is important.
Two of the three founders of the movement - the one who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Trevon Martin, in 2012 - are listed as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership support all this movement, " says Ferrel. "That's because we fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed with this assertion, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and many homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrelle was not selected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive characteristics.
"She was the man who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was on the first line, 'cause when "

Two Salvadoran football players disqualifyed for biting U.S. players
El Salvador's football team, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, received lengthy disqualifications for unsettled behaviour.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the North and Central American and Caribbean Football Confederation (CONCAAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
The first one was Henry Romero's protector.
The El Salvadorian bit Josie Altidor's attacker, then pinned him behind his chest.
Then the half-defendant Seren bit U.S. Advocate Omar GonzÃ¡lez when he put a corner in his penal square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren was disqualified by six.
The meeting itself ended with America's victory with a score of 2:0, handing over Goal.com.
Commutation: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
At the center of the Hall in Gallery Friedman in New York, people's faces, white, black and brown, all of which are awkwardly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey Harborg from the cheek and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort-Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called "Recognition."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art unites technology, information and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama reduced sentence only three days before his presidency.
Having analysed, through a DNA computer program from Manning, and used it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a deep, though not easy to perceive, manifest not only about the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the ingerent determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born under Bradley Edward's name, but from a teenage age she openly said she thought she was a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Act on espionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos were not available in prison, so only one of her photos was known: a green black and white selfie on which Manning in a platinum wig, clearly feeling awkward, sitting behind the car; with this picture, she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 project "Celebrations of strangers."
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of forensic evidence of a kind of husk and gum rubber, removing DNA from it, and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey Hagborg at a preliminary show of a new press exhibit.
At that time, Chelsea was not allowed to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her sitting muse in prison became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of comic books, "Awful Images," illustrated by Shawi Canungo, who showed how in the future the President would ease Chelsea's punishment and that one would be able to visit the exhibit personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book went out turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven heavy years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong and that the exhibition opens right now when Donald Trump announces war on people who reveal classified information in the government, and invents new ways to stir up on Twitter the hatred that he's supposed to mitigate.
When Dewey Harborg asked about the coincidence of all this over time, she said, "It's not a thing at all."
In an artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature downstairs (with a heart instead of a point above "i" in her name) calls for an end to "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the other hand, her mythochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar from pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist's scientificly expressed), Dewey Harborg hoped to show us how amazingly similar we all are, in any case in his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't determine what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video game "Light memories" is also displayed here.
"Daniel DNA can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in the same room is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
On it, King Kong Manning appears over the U.S. Kazar Building with a loud speaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win," it says.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got skin pricks when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - as it was visible in the comics - but when she comes, she'll be welcomed by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic symulatives, gathered together, like a crowd of protesters.
It's also deliberately done, like everyone on the exhibit up to the height (5"2, Manning), where the pencil was painted by genetic galpogroups.
"I'd have divorced them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, as the movement that stood for her liberation."
Professors of North-West University and staff of Oxford University are looking for police for murder charges
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at North West University and a staff member at Oxford University who are wanted as suspects because a man was found dead in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, warrants were issued on Monday for the detention of manslaughter without the right to release on bail of 40-year-old Windham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Durranlo.
According to the documents, Cornell Duranlo, 20 years old, died after he was subjected to multiple stab wounds.
In a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
The cop got a call, they came to the Grand Place apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now the detectives are investigating death from stab wounds, considering her murder, while the police are looking for two suspects.
Latham has been the associate professor of microbiology and immunology at North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Liaison, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering North West University campuses.
"Now it's a criminal case that's being investigated by authorized persons, and North West University is cooperating with the investigation," said Kabbaj.
Warren works as a senior finance officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: "We spoke to the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities."
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The chief of police liaison, Chicago Anthony Gulelmi, said that he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing," told Gulelmi.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the police phoned the manager of Grand Place, who just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The cops called the crime scene awful.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself had taken place on 27 July.
According to him, video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim have been in a relationship," said Gulelmi.
The Grand Place Manual issued a message to the residents, which reported: "The police are currently working on the chronicology of the incident, gathering information about the victim and examining a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map as soon as possible."
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled shortly.
"The defined stage of compliance has been reached, and RUSAD has been given the right to plan and conduct tests jointly with UKAD (the British Agency for Antidoping).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Moutko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the reactivation of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that might present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WAD shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian addoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of the WDA-ordered investigation of Canadian lawyer Richard Mclaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sports was controlled by the State.
On this issue, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no government program, and we won't recognize what wasn't there."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report without saying." added Smirnov.
WADA suspended RUSAD from pre-ping control in November 2015 after the Doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggly, stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire down in a 79-deck tower in Dubai
The big fire that took place in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch tower, blew up, sends Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 msk).
Local authorities reported that no injuries were sustained as a result of the incident.
At the time of the fire, the surrounding streets were closed to the skyscraper.
The reasons for the incident are not yet known.
It has previously been reported that the 79-storey housing skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world, is burning in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
Unbelievable Buzoya dress is a fan shake: pants that don't cover cowards.
Olga Buzova's "Dom-2" launch show hit the Europa Plus Live Championships.
In the eyes of thousands of fans, the new singer of a duet with Nasty Cudrey performed the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls went on stage in provocative "trousers" that were so designed as to appear to be the underwear of singers.
Buzova and Kudry were written on their pants.
Previously, it was reported that the changes in Buzov ' s appearance had been commented by a specialist from a Moscow clinic of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
Radio 4 reported on Friday, 4 August, citing foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN NATO gender also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilisation in eastern Ukraine."
Still, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was possible and that further escalation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that the relationship between the US and Russia was at a dangerous low level and accused the American Congress of that.
Ekaterinburg Metro is developing a new way of paying
In October, a bank card could be paid for travel to the ecaterinburg subway, and Paul Wedernikov, the CEO of OAO "I-Set" said in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce the same subway travel system for the 2018 World Cup as for other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want the fans from other countries, the mundiale guests, to use the metropole by using their bank cards without getting badges or standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his e-commerce start-up staff, but the interviews weren't working.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, unsettled.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
"He has never been consistent and objective," said Errett, managing a company in San Francisco of 75 Madison Reed, which deals with electronic hair-care trade.
She therefore appealed to others for help.
There is now a new type of start-up in the field of staff work that helps companies to figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to make express interviews, to approach certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymous and hot lines for complaints, and in some cases to allow informants to use top management and to direct them to the Directorate.
"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Errett told me that she had gained a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of "Glint" use.
In addition to the express interviews and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company ' s thermal map and shows in a visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber who was involved in a scandal when a former staff member posted a blog post describing the aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For start-ups like "Glint," it's a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internet portal, "Let's Talk About Pay," dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and conformity industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent Startap from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, against the backdrop of the fall in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among clients.
Like "Glint," Convercent allows companies to send individual-ordered surveys of staff opinion, to collect confidential responses in real time and to search the thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The public opinion court intercepted the power of the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is ill-treated or unethical, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of client boycotts, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan informed.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 employees work in 500 institutions, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that staff were aware of the rules and procedures, and to suggest a simple way to approach the company's head office.
Previously, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or a head office, file a formal complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
This was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported by James Vitrano, the head of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be found and dealt with quickly.
"I can draw closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management team of the Ruby Tuesday network.
"And we protect our shareholders from court proceedings with employees."
According to Queensland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of staff members in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical irregularities as a result of Dela Anron.
But only when "social networks have become widespread" did companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral transmission online.
"Presiding to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, charging companies with regular fees for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that won the approval of venture investors who supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent received funding of $10 million from firms such as the "Sapphire Ventures" and "Tola Capital," bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today ' s staff expect more jobs than before.
In markets with hard competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only a necessary minimum.
Staff want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they hear them, and that the work they do results, they're trying more to make such a company a success," says Nina McQueen, Vice-President for Global Benefits and Meeting at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies are doing well in their portfolio; companies are doing well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical instruments promise to increase the commitment and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they are supported.
According to cultural professionals in the workplace, it was important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback, it might give the impression that there are changes.
And if change is not quick enough, or not at all, it may be disappointing, and staff will lose interest.
"If you're gonna ask for 4,000 sentences, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews," says Russell Rat, the president of the management consulting firm "Kotter International," who had to see companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, "Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly surveys of staff members, is able to take action the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after feedback from staff members, poor decision-making speed and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has acquired new knowledge of its staff and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help it to better retain staff in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is being opened on the Krasnoarmey Prospect.
In Barnaula, a major effort was made to address the cause of the asphalt failure on the Krasnoarmey Prospect.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the newly planted carriageway (the crossing from the street of Youth) has been decided to "open."
We recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near tram routes was due to land in the area of an unexploded unexploded network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the Urban Committee on Road Economics, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out to complete the detailed survey and eliminate the prerequisites for the crash.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that there will be a need to re-establish the wallet of wireless communications and their concreteization.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
Breen's team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to talk on the same side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts out of their backs, shiny sweats after a busy first day of the sports camp.
For many of the team players, these minutes of undelivering are half-day breaks.
The players recorded for summer classes, after three hours of training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Vasserman football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, Coach Bruce Jim Maura said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meat cut."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working day - at least until the end of the Friday exam.
Therefore, the start of the first three trainings at the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be placed on an already tight list of players.
The negative effect of the absence of two trainings per day has been more days with one training, and Bruce is moving towards the beginning of the camp for almost a week than last year and is conducting training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they are scheduled to conduct 18 training sessions until 20 August inclusive before starting formal preparations for the first game in the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
Maura said that he supported a change in the rules of the National Student Sports Association, even though it had led to another point in the player ' s population.
"For three or four days, we're giving them this huge load, it's a serious test," said Maura.
"And they just got over it, they work, they're great guys.
I think that when we live by Saturday and we have more time, it's really gonna be great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is a difficult task, as its fields are in direct sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have overcome the protective grid behind the gate.
The Brewins players are supposed to take the hotel from this weekend, but Maura says that when the rooms are available during the season, there might be a problem.
"We're gonna have security," told Maura.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, suggesting that someone can take off the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have a video of training, it's very serious.
But we're gonna have security there, and we're gonna have security in parking number 8.
We'll do whatever we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the attack at St. Petersburg subway in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service by Vice Governor Anna Mittenina.
According to the end of July, three people remained in the hospital, transmitting TV Center.
We recall that the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolitan took place on April 3, this year.
The bomb detonated a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Asimov, were arrested.
Also, on the eve of the day, Rosbrenadzor recommended that the Metropolitan State of Petersburg review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against Facebook news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystification to independent experts and present their findings under the original posts, announced on Thursday the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight the so-called faeque news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was starting to use improved machine training algorithms to recognize possible Mystifications, send them to check and possibly show the results of the fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which the so-called fairy news has been disseminated, which many believe has influenced the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, prior to the September elections, they expressed support for the plan to impose fines on social networks if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what reports are challenged by independent inspectors, people want to have a broader context in order to make reasonable judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote in Sarah Sue's block, Facebook tape manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "connected articles" and work on other changes in the news tape to address the problem of Facebook news.
Create novel comics: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze" and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Built Valley in Kent County, he's been watching a rough story around, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a yorkshire with a cop hair and a tendency to historical documents, a novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The castle in England" covers the period from the middle centuries to the evardian era and talks about the families that lived in Scotty; each story illustrated one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevich, Bunadi May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Body of the Dead Man and Other History," a compilation of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the depth of his soul.
"I could've touched just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on a Jacobi," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because in those days the lights were lighted.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Ah, how I love archives!"
For a man who is so passionate about old papers, to receive support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and to live in the castle for four months, it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day, went through the archives and looked at the many treasures of the family and old things - for example, the heads of the hyena on walls or bottles in the mouth of centuries.
He went through the park and the ruins of the old castle, spoke to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on the illusions to his book.
Then, at night, he was "dranking whiskey and going to pee."
The story of Scotty's castle was not very well studied because the National Fund was granted full access only in 2006, when the last heir died, Elizabeth Hassi.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the staff had just begun to deal with the archive he described as "that the aristocrates had fallen into the attic for centuries."
The days, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who had what he had: "You think land disputes are boring, " says Rhodes, "but this is what two families fought for.
It happens, guys!"
In some stories, the castle is becoming the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the robotics, the hero departs from the newly built castle to join the 1381 Crusader Revolution.
"To report on the riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called "Kent and Sassex's Royal Families," says Rhodes.
"The Krestian rebellion began in these places, and I thought the riot was an appropriate beginning.
Maybe they were connected."
Other stories are closely linked to the castle story, such as the "Lister," which describes the Jewish priest, whom Darrel's family had been hiding for seven years during the British Reform.
Or "Contrabandist," about Arthur Darrell's 18th century smuggler, who believed to have staged his own funeral by stoned a coffin (it was discovered after several years when the coffin was dug up).
Darrels is the beloved family of Rhodes, of all Scotty's inhabitants: "Gentlmen seem to have been a perfect cheat, they've always been in debt and spent money on something they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrel men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of pretty guys who can take care of big estate heirs."
After completing work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writer's experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish dungeon, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmaki, a place where he was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then grew up again in the forest.
But Scotty's still a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose Rossius.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is evolving: following Sberbank, TTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this community organization.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will come from the ARB.
But this is not just an exit - all banks that have declared a break with ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions - the Russian Association of Regional Banks, which is headed by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Gosdum Committee on the Financial Market, recognized as the result of the last session and the most effective head of the thought committee and deputy of the number of bills prepared.
The outbreak of the conflict within the ARB took place during the debate in the Council of the Federation, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, including a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
Then Garegin Tosunian, President of ARB, said that the association believed that the bill was adopted for the benefit of the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which was indeed objected to by the representative of the CB: many of the leaders of the surplus banks, in particular the External Prombank, were part of the ARB's governing bodies.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main bank regulator has become a clear reason for the 15 largest banks to start preparing for joining the Russia Association, noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB will be low and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually taking place."
The contributors will be better.
What's the end of the case?
We answer immediately to the main question that arises at or near the slightest disruption or conflict in the banking sector: investors are not at risk of anything, but rather the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Leads the "Rossia" Anatoli Aksakov, known for his ploughing in all aspects of the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all CB management is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert assessments of the "regionals."
Human resources and institutional constraints are clearly not foreseen either.
There is no doubt that RBA is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential actors are deprived of their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest institution, established in 1991, an organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking law and monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that in Russia's open arms association, we are willing to accept new members under any circumstances, based on the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakova (which may, too much), who was still on 21 July at the press briefing at the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "the following day, the representatives of the retired ARB banks asked me to consider increasing the potential of our Russia association."
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of Association, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is under way, the proposals of both sides are being examined, and an extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared and will take place in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, while stressing that the chair was not holding, called it possible for the new leader of the updated Russia Association, Georgia Luntovsky, who was leaving in September as Vice-President of the Centralobank, to highly characterize his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his leave and arrive in Moscow for one day, at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Russian Association, where consideration is scheduled to be given to the agenda of the extraordinary convention of Russia.
The entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia will not be restricted
The Deputy Head of Mintrans, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-fuelled vehicles into the major cities of Russia would not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually upgrade the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
It's the same phrase at the slogan level - let's stop it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole town?
"For 20 years, I don't know if it's gonna happen," says the Prime Minister's words.
Previously, the newspaper Izvedia reported that, by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arkadia Dvorkovica had been charged with studying proposals on possible options for electric transport support submitted to the Government by the Director-General of PAO KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, the use of vehicles from the SAF in large cities and resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for obtaining greencards.
The plan aims to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions on the granting of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars to taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the US delivers Greencards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit candidates who own English, have the financial resources that enable them to maintain themselves and have the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the American media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
We didn't have time to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, and a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots was issued.
Yeah.
Sex robots are the focus of attention now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently issued a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users can choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples and the type of nails.
"People are joking about it, but firms are sending them to consumers in a large number, and soon we'll see them much more," said Sharkey at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex clubs have evolved from their inflatable gatherers into robots with silicone skin, warm to feel, and with almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "paint" their robots in their own taste, choosing everything from the color of the eye and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" over which Stepford's wife would seem very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex clubs have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix Robot allows users to build in robots of quality that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold's sex robots developed by True Companion, which are supplied with an already programmed identity, such as the Cold Farr, appear to be shy, and Dicky Wendy has a "measure" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits you well," "True Companion" reports.
So she loves what you love, she doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She's changing her mood for a day like a real man!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in a mood!
The emergence of sex robots is a source of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of the concern is the subordinate image of a woman, a rape association that leads to the possession of the Cold (reading: resisting) Fara.
"True Companion" Roxxy is compared to a vibrator only for men.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and growing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subordination as an option.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery may be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people aren't stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came up when women's rights around the world were threatened when there was a president in the White House who boasted about what was up to women.
The scariest part of the "Maidmaster's Talence" series is not graphic images, crucified bodies and blindfolded, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want people to feel like they're copying human body movements.
But it's not like the real women who are "characters" of robots.
They can't break up with or leave their partners.
They have no life, no biography, nothing that could point to independence or something that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Pukh) Jeter, who has been in charge of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which is starting on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, the General Manager of the Blue Yellows, Andrei Lebedev, reported this.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he wouldn't be here for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will make it possible to develop our young players," he said.
I recall that, with the direct involvement of Jeter, Ukraine's team took its sixth place on Eurobasket 2013 and first hit the World Basketball Championship, where yellow blues were unable to overcome the group phase, and the U.S. harvester averaged 15.4 points, 3 rebounds and 5 assists.
Jeter has ceased to advocate for Ukraine's team since his departure as the chief coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
The men's Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will have its band tournament match on Earth promised.
There will be five joints in group B of the Morzin Trust Eugenia: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team carried out two control battles in which the Dutch and Belarusians surrendered.
The great turn of Trump?
It seems very reasonable to imagine Mita Romney.
In the Trump era, the common place was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers sang columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're gonna blow up soon.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet from Chicago, who's been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unification in the struggle against the common enemy could have a strong effect.
At Trump's White House, all she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and weirdly found herself on the same side.
At dinner, it's certainly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it might be quite dangerous.
The Trump breathed power into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule could lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right Republicans, who, against the background of its standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I've caught myself missing the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today, with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 per cent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Trump and both seem very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in New York Park Park Department, and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don't need coffee.
Horses are thunderstorms and huge, glass fibre pictures on the central drum - grimacinating clowns and animals that look terribly at their backs - extremely evils, and ringing music, weirdly, is fascinated.
So many famous things in this city are disillusioned: the species from the skyscrapers are getting tired, the silhouettes of the buildings are too much to cause awe, and the reality of the city isn't gonna catch the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I found out that Suisse-Cottedge isn't really a Swiss ball (the theme pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" is not a big roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women of forty can have a great time.
If I could give the carousels an assessment, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to do that.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before I could run a terminal card, evaluate my "test" shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same plus the option to conduct a tip evaluation at 15 percent for the counter.
As a result, not only has a neutral interaction slowed down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor salesman at the university smiled at her, and I was tired of assessing my experience in giving her a credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison because of a doctor's visit for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat the wrist cuts he claimed to have received as a result of the fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office against an initial sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steinkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his friend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office announced its intention to lodge another protest this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney-General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretorius may increase by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect of the beating of a TV journalist has been given a subscription to the non-extradition.
Large law enforcement officials chose a restraining measure in the form of a sign of non-extradition for a man who attacked a TV journalist, Nikita Rozjayev, during a live broadcast from Gorkogo Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
"In the context of an investigation into the criminal case initiated in article 116 of the Criminal Code (Poboi) against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a correspondent of a television channel in the Central Park for Culture and Rest of the Name of Gorjkogo, a suspect who was ordered to take a restraining measure in the form of a sign of non-extradition and proper conduct," Volk clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up in respect of the suspect for non-compliance with the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the live broadcast to the HV Day, a man was approached by the correspondent and struck in the face.
As later turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the HV.
According to Rozjaev himself, the deserters, on the other hand, tried to hold the Moscow.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who put tents in an unsolved place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Seattle.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BBC that Bulgarian citizens were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed serious fines on anyone caught in a parking area that is not intended for that purpose.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may order a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the US Vice-President of the cold war rhetoric.
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly rolling towards the primitive ideological booms of the cold war, which are completely out of reality," as stated in the statement of the Russian foreign policy agency.
In that way, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the words of Pens about the "Russian threat" and the attempts to forcibly close the borders they had made in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "or with the West or Russia" and the lack of clarity about the alleged non-alterative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to remove Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another source of tension.
"Call on American colleagues to stop Russia's slapping and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests," is stated in the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldsher was hit by an ambulance accident in Podmoskowje
The accident took place in the Stupino sub-smoker, and the impact of the Scorch Carnet was caused by a collision of annomark with a paramedic.
Today, about 08:10 msk was struck by a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino Moscow.
"As a result of the crash, the ambulance turned off," TSS stated in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers work, the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son in the construction, wrapped in a cellophanic bag.
On the evening of 3 August, the section police received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in a small private house.
"The scene of the incident was visited by law enforcement officials and doctors who quickly brought the child to a medical facility," reported in the Odessa Head of the National Police.
Medics determined that the boy was born a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of the cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative activities, the identity of the child is identified as a 36-year-old local resident.
It is also established that a woman has three more young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously been placed under special consideration in the eyes of law enforcement officials.
The police are currently determining the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nicolae, a 21-year-old woman threw her underweight child into a garbage pipeline.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists in the Russian Estrada Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday in the coming Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the Witness.
I remember your half-mind.
The special tent in the Luzhniks, Gloria Gainor sang for a birthday girl, was a powerful sling over Moscow River.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
What's the point?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I've worked a lot, I've been walking around with tours all over the country three times, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
Released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not what, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks don't lie.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them, you're recording the new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to the Los Angeles station.
It's called "What are you so serious?" on a single song that was written together with Timati.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we're filming the video on it.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow City Hall.
The American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand on your new record.
Do you think you wanted him to be involved in your tournament?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I asked him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson (known drummer in various projects).
But for their long work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It involved fees ranging from Y35,000 to Y45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space as well.
And I found Max Baby's great drummer.
Actually, it's better to feed your own people.
Sometimes I want to get into one of them, not for what it's worth.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly categorized at the international level.
It's written by Western music magazines, invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another performance technique."
Your album goes to Los Angeles, American musicians work with you, but you can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, frankly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm truly sorry that I can't get to America.
I've told you that I've been studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the better you do.
We're not dumb enough, but we don't have that experience, schools.
For 70 years, our artists have never had the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They sought the best possible sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'm gonna apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy so I can go back there and work the most important thing.
The rest of Europe treats me favourably.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a pre-order, but an affinity, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sports Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
We've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already been sold.
On the "Randev Lyma Wycule," which will begin on 20 July in Yurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyma is a great singer and a great woman who can serve herself with a beautiful vocal, even a whisper.
After the tournaments and the commemorative concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Wassonic's creativity once.
You already have two albums with his songs in your CDography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's gonna be completely different.
I want to write some 80-90 songs about the same performance as he did himself.
Just voice and guitar.
No other oranges.
I'm gonna have our famous musician Timur Wedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlevic Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it works.
You and the songs of Boris Grebencherov gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write down the album of his stuff?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I've crossed him several times and asked him if I could sing one of his songs.
He said, "Grigorius, I write songs to be fulfilled."
Please try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to write that one down.
Until I have this task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do that.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I guess until you realize his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of actors that I'd dream of having under my wing, but they're independent, past people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Sereza's a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he's got his own development strategy.
And in my center, there are now Alexander Panyots, whom I was driving in the Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be truly unfortunate if it did not reach the heights that were worthy.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, take off the clips.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buying them songs, crying to poets, sometimes their tracks go into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they don't reach high altitude, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return their money into them.
Although I'll be pleased if one of them gets commercial success and pays me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if it doesn't happen, I'm not gonna cover anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, run, prove how I used to prove it.
If tomorrow you're invited to make a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you?
I'm still invited there.
These are mainly closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a luxury man, and I was convinced to fly to Syria on the plane that was then broken.
If they say tomorrow that we have to go somewhere else in the interest of the State, I'll fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this has been the case with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and should be together.
I'm sorry it won't work, at least soon.
I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine in a year.
We've met nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with a few Ukrainian artists, they worked together: Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of people are gifted, and it is truly regrettable that now they cannot fully absorb their talents to a broad Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian singer to Russia, such as Slavu Vacarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely for the moment...
Andrea Ohlopkova was moved from the cosmodrome.
As "JO" became known, the technical director of the East Andrei Ohlopkov cosmodrome began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (GTCCP) entitled Chrunichev.
He had previously been de facto involved in the construction of the East cosmodrome, but because of his disagreement with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure Operations (CENCI), he had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Philes where production coordination would take place.
Mr. Ohlopkov's changer will not be available: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished and the function will be separated by the units of CENCI.
The fact that the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of Technology of CENCI, Andrei Ohlopkov, had moved to work in Hrunicev's DGCCP, was told by the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as by a government staff member.
"He's been working on a new post for a few weeks," explained "JO" in the industry.
It was not possible to obtain an operational comment from CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information "JO" has officially been confirmed in the HPCTC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, stated at the enterprise.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work in CENCI in 2013, with a space service behind his shoulders, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, he served as First Deputy Commander at the rank of Colonel on the "Server" cosmodrome.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: the regional merchants allegedly received from his handing over the State orders but failed to comply with their obligations to clean the separated parts of the launch vehicle in the Arhangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technology development responsibilities in CENCI have been extended to various projects, but the main of them has been the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Butpenco, in an interview "JO" explicitly stated that the situation in East "was critical as early as October 2013."
The fact is that a strategic error was made in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Alliance-2.1 missile was planned for the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and was scheduled to be completed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be tricky: CENCI specialists had begun to install the technology equipment parallel to the facilities that had not been built.
Andrew Ohlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks that existed and the postponement that took place (in December 2015, the Union left only on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source "J" on the cosmodrome: "We would still not have made a single move from the East but would have been building."
Dmitri Rogozin's vice-premier, who is in charge of making a cosmodrome, called Andrea Ohlopkov his "space Susanian" joke, but he almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Ohlopkov was remembered and made clear: for example, in an interview "JO," he suggested that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spexline) should be debarred from the status of the only East executive and work directly with sub-contractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in the same basket of Spetzstroy?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibilities of the General Contractor to complete the construction and construction work on the launch and technical complex scheduled for the fourth quarter.
According to JO, Mr. Ohlopkov ' s transition to a new place of work has led to disagreement with the CNNCI leadership on how to complete the construction of facilities and space complexes, as well as on how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best for everyone," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
The government staff member, in turn, calls the decision weird: "He was one of the best professionals, finding him an equivalent replacement would not be easy."
According to JO, this will not be required: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished and its functions will be separated by the units of the ECDIS.
Two specialties will be introduced in music schools
In the future, children ' s music schools will be able to receive two courses at the same time.
According to the Vice-Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of Saintoslaw Bluebenko, this may be done by recounting students with repeated discipline, while the issue of the other classes in the second occupation can be resolved through special grants, and the RIA News is referred to.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we will work with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will enable the two professions to be developed, but at the same time it will not be contrary to the existing legislation in the field of education," said Bluebenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Ned Talk" with the children's centre "Sirius," a teacher, Maria Andreeva, reported that she had to pay for repeat subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory at the CMS.
The girl told me she was studying in the violin and piano class and had awards in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old luxuriant was detained on a wall on the skyscraper.
In Mexico, 17-year-old luxury Kirill N., who climbs the roof of the tall building, reports the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
A young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed the three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed into one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
A young man was already held on the roof.
Members of the Ministry of Public Security put him on the ground on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute for Migration.
They find out if the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man climbing up to the altitude has become popular on the Network.
Users called a young man a spider.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolates can help to ease the VHC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: diet, rich in meat proteins and dairy products, can help alleviate symptoms for those suffering from intestinal disease.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 3,00000 in the United Kingdom, leads to the cradle and grinding of the stomach, the chronic or bloody nose, the loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
Usually, in order to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid of the protein triptofan contributes to the production of immunum cells that increase the tolerance of the intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunized cells in the intestine were being monitored to ensure that harmful microbes from food did not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of launching an inflammation process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body and without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammable intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in the intestines have increased the tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria needs a triptofone - one of the building elements of the protein - to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of a normal microbial intestine, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptofan was contained in the power of mice, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptofhan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inclined environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Servantes-Barragantwas' post, studying the variety of increasing tolerance of immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and the other group that belonged to the same line, but was held separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mice intestinal microbioms - bacteria, viruses and fungus communities that usually live in the stomach-cheese tract.
The DNA of mice intestines was sequestered, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but missing from mice without them.
The mice produced in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbioma and did not develop this kind of immunized cells were received by L. reuteri, and immunized cells appeared in them.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then moved small fluids - without bacteria - to undisturbed immunized mice cells.
Immunic cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of triptofane processing known as indol-3-methyl acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofane in mice food, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptofane level was halved, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increased tolerance of cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their stomach-intestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of triptofane from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans as in mice, but in humans suffering from inflammable intestinal diseases, defects were found in genes associated with triptofan.
She says: "The development of these cells may need to be strengthened, because these cells depend on the inflammation processes on the inside surface of the kishk.
High triptofane levels, with L. reuteri available, can potentially lead to an increase in their population."
According to JosÃ© Mourenu, Manchester United hired geniuses in the face of Nemanyi MatiÄ.
Manchester United hired genius in Nemanyi MatiÄ's face, thinks JosÃ© Moorinue after a half-defendant debuted in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The game, purchased for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, started with a win of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season game of United in front of the Super Bowl WEFA game against Real Madrid on Thursday, and gave an impression as a semi-defendant, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira went forward when they wanted to.
However, since MatiÄ did not participate in the pre-season tour "Chelsea" in Asia, he was seriously short of preparing for the game, and he only took 45 minutes, which, according to Mourena, required further development before the start of the premier league season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius about how he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourena.
"We'll help him prepare sooner than later."
Just like Matic, his fellow-new players Victor LindelÃ¶f and Romel Lukak started playing at the Aviva Stadium when Mourenius began to form his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Indicent newspaper reported this week that Mourynew wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I thank the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've done a lot of work for me."
Former social democratic leaders in Lithuania are persuaded to remain in the ruling coalition
The former Presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the ex-Premier of Algirdas Butkjavichus and Gediminas Kirquilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seima of Social Democratics, Ceslovas JÃ¼rschenas, appealed to one party to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parlament newspaper, a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition because of tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and Green.
And here are three senior experienced comrades who addressed an open letter to one party, which, inter alia, says: "It is clear the disappointment of the party partners with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the environs has created for us, not very lightly, but still the conditions for the further realization of the social justice objectives that we have set forth in our initiative in the Government's programme and for maintaining the political dominance of the left centre over the right parties."
In the view of the former party leaders, the debate has so far "fellowed an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party ' s reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamaev has been fined
Mosgorud reduced the sentence to a person with disabilities, Anton Mamaev, from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirazev Court.
In so doing, Mosgorud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motorist from a former Special Forces combatant.
Mosgorud reduced the sentence to 200,000 roubles by his decision to Anton Mamaev.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which is also a criminal offence, and accordingly such a person must be prosecuted," explained "JO" to press secretary Mosgorood Uljan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account the health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, which provides that the penalty may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasilia Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would warrant a change in the gravity of the sentence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with the decision of Mosgorud.
I'm disappointed by the decision of the court.
The only legitimate solution would be justification, and it would continue to fight for justice.
His counsel, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out an appeal against the judgement before the Court of Cassation of Mosgorood and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
Remember, Anton Mamaev, a 28-year-old Moscow, with spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure last fall.
The disabled claim to have bought a motor operator from a friend for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motorist, among whom the former Special Forces combatant, claimed that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov had taken possession of their property, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timirazev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilil Seroshtanov to three years of colony and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment and serving his sentence in the general regime colony (under art. 162, art.
After the disabled was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Attorney-General ' s Office, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moscalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timirazev Court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Moscow.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final "Forum of Action" of the Russian People's Front (FFA) in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, inform the "Extellares" source in the UNTSO and confirm the head of the Alexei Anishim movement.
He said that, as a result of the Forum, the Frontwicks were planning to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment and to propose a strategy to address them.
The news interviewers in ONF note that the report of the Head of State will contain a "deep analyst" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the News, the final UNTSO forum will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of the event is not yet determined - it is usually placed under the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key activities of the UNTSO.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one per two federal districts, in Rostov na Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatiya Ulan Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward at these events, we will develop systemic proposals to address environmental issues, and we have told the "Expoients" of the interviewee at the UNTSO.
The Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Olga Timothy Movement, who chaired the State Environment and Environmental Protection Committee, reported that the "fronty" would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNTSO Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we grew up a strong team of environmental experts, saw gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontomatics" are also being reported on the work on the priority projects of the ONF, and told the "Ives" by Olga Timothy.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would also be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the work of the ONF Mediaforum, which had taken place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Environment Year will go into history, and most importantly, what needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for years.
To keep these issues from falling out of the agenda, Olga Timothy added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrei Koladine, noted that, by raising environmental issues, the ONF was acting in line with the Presidential agenda.
Many of the things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, said Andrew Koladin, "The News."
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
In the future, through ONF, the regions will be able not only to solve their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, added an expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the waste dump in Balashina (also closed) and the coal dust at the port of Nahodka (a bill to ban open coal transhipment in populated areas, one of the authors, Olga Timothyev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the issue is further enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
The head of the Ecology for All charity, Leonid Bochin, needs clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State.
A member of the HRC, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Tsiplenkov, stressed that a responsible approach to environmental problems was needed in order to successfully address the environmental problems of society and business, and that there was little legislative effort.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more strategic step, the situation will change, Serguey Tsiplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the tendency that environmental law violations were a cost-effective solution for business.
The British inventor put himself in a microchip to get into the house and the car in the back of his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so he could open his house door, go into the office, and even start a car with a simple whistling arm.
Stephen Northham, a 30-year-old, lived a tiny chip between big and index fingers, and now, through his firm BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives on the basis of technology.
He joined with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist consultant from the Royal Prince in Winchester, to ensure that the process of activation is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology looks like a microchip that brings cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northham also replaces locks in houses and cars with a 300-pound chip per lock.
A married father of one child has already installed technology in his home and in his vehicle, "BMW Z4" which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House's claim was paid to taxpayers in thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces provided to the magazine TIME, the White House's decision last month to bring a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost a total of $24,000 to taxpayers.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One," when the president was on board, became the central element of an event held on 17 July at the White House that demonstrated American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior White House officials examined technological products from all 50 states.
The helicopter that took place in Connecticut was placed near a yacht from Maine State, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a machine truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Seafighters (HMX-1), the Division responsible for the management of the helicopter, the White House Military Office ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to see that you knew because it was an unusual press event," wrote the HMX-1 commander in an e-mail to his superior, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 hours of the day and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return the flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit ' s security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the records received by the TIME magazine whether the second crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was in conflict with the order.
" Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it wasn't," the commander wrote.
"Looks like you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The event "America Made" was announced as a formal event by the White House, and the Hatch Act did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of the health sector that had been developed at that time in the Senate and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask them for one thing in the interest of photo opposability.
Trump has already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane passed backwards during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account has been blocked by reports alleging the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the "America Made" showing products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 is often used as training flights around Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight carried out for the "America Made" event was counted on the crew for the required training flights per month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours on that day as part of the "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits represented at the event.
Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in the organization of a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly rate for the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D reimbursement rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records indicate that air flight time was 30 minutes each from its airfield at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that.
"To calculate the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement is totally wrong," says Walters.
"These approximate rates include personnel, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allotments."
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the REND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House press secretary Sean Spyer spoke in defence of the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week the things made in America," said Spyer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, of course, it is entirely appropriate to draw attention to this."
It was unclear whether Trump had interacted with a helicopter looking at the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in a driver's seat in a firefighter.
In the White House, Trump contacted Sikorsky for a press talk about his own company's food fleet.
"I know "Sikorsky," said the president.
Moscow will grant grants to the resuscitatory units of urban hospitals
Every year, the "Save Life" grants will be allocated to the rehabilitation and intensive care units of the Capital Medical Clinic.
Funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobite, visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he gave a thank-you-you-go letter to the Traumaologist-ortoped Victor Procco, under the leadership of which a major operation was carried out to reconstruct the adolescent's foot.
Sergei Sobinin also reported on the decision to provide grants to the rehabilitation and intensive treatment units of urban clinics every year.
The funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital commander, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is now one of the largest hospitals in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment to enable doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Colombo Rural Hospital.
Currently, the health units are designed to receive more than 1,000 patients.
In addition to resuscitation and in-patients, there are day-care units.
There are 2,800 hospital staff.
The total area of the clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year, the medical institution became a member of a pilot project to organize short-term residences (MTS).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the course of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time frame for the rehabilitation of patients.
They only spend a few hours after surgery at the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with fixed medical assistance at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff in the clinic carried out 8,500 operations with varying degrees of complexity.
NSA reported no buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
In Nazbank, Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no requests for the purchase of the Ukrainian Sberbank's daughter.
This is reported on Friday, 4 August, by TASS with reference to a representative of the media service of the NSA.
The NSA confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Procopeni, was withdrawn to agree on the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank's shares by proxy (through Paritetbank).
"No documentation was received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank's shares in the NSA," noted in the report.
On 3 August, the Belarusian businessman Victor Procopene withdrew his application for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it became apparent that the Nazbank of Ukraine denied Russian businessmen Said Gucelaini and Grigori Gosellnikov the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" by Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision that the businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify that they met the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka Consortium and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceri, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Gucerie.
The five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were sanctioned against "docks" in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country to the benefit of maternal organizations.
The third season trailer, Narco: in the popular series of Netflix, after Pablo Escobar's death, the Kali cartel plays a central role.
Although the second season of Narco revealed the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix was far from complete.
The flow service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been introduced by the first trailer demonstrating the evils of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the Agency ' s attention was drawn by the richest organization of drug traffickers, the Kali cartel.

The third season of Narco will be released on the screens of September 1st.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated at the United Nations.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, have declared the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heisom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women were running for provincial council elections, three women were fighting for the post of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year ' s election, power passes for the first time peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Hayesom stated that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million were women.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office confirmed the indictment in the Nikita Whites case.
The Russian Attorney-General ' s Office confirmed the indictment in the criminal case against the former Governor of the Kirov region, Nikita Belyov, accused of obtaining a large bribe.
This was reported on Thursday, 3 August, by the agency, transmitting RIA News.
The material was referred to the Moscow Regional Court of Presney for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, there was a tightening of tourist fines for inappropriate behaviour.
The Venice authorities have increased the penalties for bathing in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around town in a bathing suit or with a naked tors, they will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros, the TASS will be handed over to the Russian Travel Operators Association for a picnic in a public place or for a bicycle ride on pedestrian areas.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose a fine for the inscriptions on Euro400 monuments and for the garbage of Euro25.
To inform tourists of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be made available through the special company Enjoy, Respect Venice (#Enjoy RespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through announcements and posters on the website of the city council, on the billboards and in the largest tourist gathering sites.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser, Paula Mar, fines will be handed over to the embassies of their home countries to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian City Administration announced plans to limit the tour traffic.
In Venice, the restriction on the number of tourists visiting the centre of the city has already been successful.
Only 60,000 visitors were admitted to the site instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Redentore festival.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new hotels and fast-food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
The State Border Service detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with EU countries in the first half of 2017; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the State Service.
Of these, 314 persons were detained for illegal crossing of the border, while the rest were detained for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.

According to statistics, mainly citizens of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Armenia, India, Viet Nam and Viet Nam are among the detained illegal migrants.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants have not been missed in Ukraine.
Remember, the EU has found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz at Skolkovo: experiment and improvisation
The second Skolkovo Jazz Science Festival was announced and will be held on 26 August at the Skolkovo Innovation Center.
The guests are awaiting presentations by leading jazz groups and solicitors, scientific discussions, interactive sites and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the site will be an improvisation territory and a field to demonstrate new creative opportunities.
"The guests of the festival will be able to download into the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovation in science becomes a new instrument of interaction with art," described the forum's orientation of the Vice-President of the Skolkovo Foundation, Elena Zelentsov.
Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 has many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra Igor Butman, who will present a joint programme with the vocalist Jaroslav Simonova.
Jazz and science - related concepts, and they were not accidentally connected - explained the popular artist "Ivestoys."
Jazzman's experiment and improvisation are as high as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the Azekel, a British of Nigerian origin known as its own creativity, and the joint work with legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
We look forward to the opening in Russia by the jazz fans of the Grammy Prize five times, the Pianoist Christian Sands (USA) with his trio.
In a new capacity, one of the best academic cameras of the Music Viva, under the leadership of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of the pianist Yuri Favorin, will try.
The merger of jazz, ethnic and electronic music, as well as academic traditions, will demonstrate the ensemble "Marimba Plus" and its leader, composer and singer on Lea Splenner's marimbe.
One of the most unusual festivals promises to be the winner of the Sergei Kurehin Award, Anton Maskeliadze.
An art experimenter controls music and video by sign - that's how leap motion technology works.
There will be eight music groups on just two scenes of the festival.
In addition, the programme includes open debates, interactive zones and art objects that combine the idea of merging music and science.
The guests will be able to take part in the experiments, visit the scientific buffet and watch the creation of cryo-frozen or bubble sands from the collapse and water.
In the special zone of vinyl, it will be possible to purchase records of relevant jazz actors and other musical figures, and at the book fair, publications on various subjects, including music, scientific and popular literature and biomedical literature.
SF released Lake from the position of head of committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council supported the statement made by Victor Ozerov, Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, and released him from the post.
He remains a senator from the Habarov province.
A request for his release from the position of the Lakes was made last week.
He explained his decision on the need for rotation and his desire to change the rhythm of life.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Victor Ozerov has been represented in the FRF since 1996 by the Legislative Assembly of the Habarov province.
The Senate has been running the Defence and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheap for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric energy consumers for a decade are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity in low stress for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation on the amendment of the Regulations on the Whole Market for Electric Power and Power and the Consolidated Project Balance of Electricity Production and Supply (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation (No. 842), established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for Burundian commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have offended the threshold of Moscow's cabinets in vain attempts to level the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkut region and the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angar, which comes from Baikala, the main catchment area for which Buryatiya is the main catchment area.
And only this year's progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Federal Government ' s Buryatiya in the list of areas of the wholesale market price zones, which set out the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets, there has been a series of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkut region pays for kilowatts/hours of 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff moves towards a downward trend for Buryatia.
Scooter didn't scare the Ukrainian Attorney General and flew to Crimea.
The electronic dance music legend, the Scooter group flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Ukrainian Attorney General ' s Office.
"The field went well, and tomorrow I'll have a concert," says the RIA News, the words of the frontman of the Aich P Baxter group.
Previously, the German edition Bild, referring to the Ukrainian Deputy Attorney General, Eugenia Einina, reported that for a visit to Crimea, which was considered temporarily occupied by Ukraine, musicians could face up to eight years of imprisonment in Kiev.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclav Festival, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is hosted by Golden Balca for the International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous groups, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the guests of the festival will be Sergei Galanin and his group SerGa, as well as Garik Sukachev with Brigada C.
In the Moscow subway, the premiere of the new season "The Games of Thrones" will take place.
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of "The Games of Thrones" will take place in the Metropolitan Metropolitan Capital.

It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of 18 July at one of the stations under the Night of the Subway.
In the lobby under the soundtrack, the show of visitors will meet actors moving into white walkers.
All those who want to do so can also take a picture of a copy of the iron throne that will be installed on the platform.
According to the First Deputy Chief of the Moscow Metropolis, Roman Latipov, showing the series underground, which will be the first in history, will help the viewers to feel better about what's happening on the screen.
The National Union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about the capitalization of the McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's biscuit manufacturer for its long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish GMB office reports that the company has been silent about future investments at the Tolkros site.
More than 500 people work in a factory producing, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than Â£5 million in the facility.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union "know them first."
In a letter to the head of the company ' s facility, the Scottish office GMB demanded from McVitie's reaction to the concern that funding would not be available for upgrading production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the business facility and the investment plan for the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in Greater Glasgow territory; this is a crucial pillar of decent work in high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, the rise in subsistence and chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs to flourish at the McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, "The leader of the Tolkrose facility only received a letter from the Scottish GMB office yesterday, and the company will reply immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the trade union."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with staff and representatives of GMB, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to the staff about how all companies working in the most competitive and unstable economic climate are constantly reviewing their actions - and this is about all our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested over Â£5 million in our Tolkros object, especially in production lines and improved performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and if there is any change in the work of the facility, the employees and union representatives will know it first."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of the supply of gas to the Eastern Petroleum Company (VNPC) should be connected to the Kremlin and the Cabinet, but that Gazprom would not give instructions, nor would the Rosnefti.
Thus, Russia's President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneftue and Gazprom should be determined solely on the basis of market principles.
Previously, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC threatened the project ' s duration.
Cechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources, added Sechin.
We recall that Rosnepht requested that it be allowed to use gas from the Kierin Gazprom mine located on the Sahelian shelf for a "East petrochemical company."
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue were ongoing and there were no sharp corners there.
Did the "Barcelon" POW warn you about Neymar's transition three years ago?
La League participant can regret his interest in Marco Verratty.
Pari Saint-Jermen will not stop stalking Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record that took place three years ago?
The Sensation Proposal revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was ready to beat the world record at the cost of the transition more than double the previous mark of Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for Â£89 million.
When the transition is over, Neimar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, as the SCW offers him more than 500,000 pounds a week's salary clean.
It is known that Barcelona and anger from the proposal, and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as the source close to the Catalan Club has insisted, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of the SCW?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blosse Matuidy in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a hard warning to every club that would like to lure one of the best players in the SCW.
"I'm not worried 'cause they know if they're touched by one of our players, then we're gonna go against them, we're gonna make offers to their players," Al-Helaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they'll have consequences."
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in the semi-defendant Marco Verratty of the KPW.
The SCW has made it clear that it will not release an Italian player on any terms, and now it is likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its proposal as a loss to one of its most valuable players, Neymara.

The project focuses on the HoReCa segment, the small pink and the offices.

In an interview with Komsomolian Truth, the Russian singer called Manson "unbelievable" and "reverse."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Liza thinks Manson needs to go to the morda for his words.
Remember, an American artist known for his epathetic actions spoke harshly about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, the "Celebrities of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement commented on Joseph Prigojin's domestic producer.
