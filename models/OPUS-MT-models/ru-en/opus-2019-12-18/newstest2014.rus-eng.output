In Kineshm and the area, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about one-hundredth, in Lugny village, a man, born in 1947, committed suicide by hanging.
He's known to have tried suicide before.
Which led a man to such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man resident of Kineshma died at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs ' s press service "Kineshemski" reports.
Is the black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the tearing-up highway system, many begin to see a solution in a small black box carefully built on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every passing car mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated system of financing of the motorways of America undertaken by the planning bodies of Washington and the state.
Usually, a boring highway planning arena suddenly generated intense debate and coloric alliances.
Liberals joined environmental groups in lobbying for the Government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass and even possibly where you drive them - and then to use this information in tax accounts.
The tea movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to negotiate, continue or not, several states are not waiting.
They wonder how over the next decade we can move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not a question on which we may have the right to choose," said Hassan Irat, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who is preparing plans to start tracking by the state authorities of the miles passing each California car by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans on motor vehicles.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Motor vehicles travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise taxes on even one cent at high petrol prices.
"The petrol tax is simply impossible to maintain," said Lee Mannich, transport policy expert at Minnesota University.
In his state, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed for the testing of the milling system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
They call it a small user's fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning bodies in California are looking at this system in the development of strategies to meet the targets set by the ambitious laws of that state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber ' s Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system to be the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market recruits in the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to get drivers to pay for each mile.
"It's not just a tax that's gonna go into a black hole," Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs, Reason, said.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a small payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a 90 million-dollar pilot project last year, involving some 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the fear of rural legislators representing voters, who often had to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon State, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of traffic instead of a petrol tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track each step.
"The concern about "big brother" and such things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who is the head of strategy and efficiency management in the Department of Transport of Nevada State.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: "It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of several states that is struggling to search for low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of miles passing by, but without information on place and time.
If you can do that, said Han, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market of the type of car insurance, where drivers were paid on the basis of a run.
But the devices she tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do that if you don't track their speed and track their location," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers experiment with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
In other places, we hope to sell the idea to a cautious public, forcing the devices to do more rather than less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that will also receive parking counter payments, provide "pays as you drive" insurance and collect a real-time speed pool from other drivers who could use cars to avoid traffic.
"Automobilists will attract the benefit they will be offered" is stated in the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering if all the talking about a small payment is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of a trust fund for highway construction by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and many other things.
EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in the event of Russia ' s economic pressure
The European Union has a standby plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as an agreement with IMF on emergency credit, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are under way with IMF on loan stand-by, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their purpose was to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuter doubt that Ukraine and IMF can overcome long-standing differences on funding terms.
I do not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign ranking by one step on Friday, to "B" with "B."
However, EU representatives say that IMF can be flexible in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
It may be a "North Flow" or a conversion from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia " isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and is likely to result in a reduction in supplies to other regions.
"Inter-EU countries and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the source Reuter.
Russia is not in the fight for urban pollution by motor vehicles
Efforts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most mega-cities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
It was generally either a matter of re-engineering and expansion of highways or an attempt to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time they were used.
Singapore ' s example is well known, where the growth of private cars has been subject to strict quotas and the right to purchase them is being purchased at auctions.
His price may be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the centre of the city.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain ecoclass are allowed to enter, which also uses high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environment Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 at a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to JO, the Director of Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau of Beijing, Lee Kunseng, the main objective of the five-year period was to reduce leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million) and increase by no more than 5 per cent the use of fuel per vehicle.
According to the agency, 22.5 per cent of total air pollution is now responsible for transport operations in Beijing.
Among the main measures of the programme is the restriction of road transport as well as the introduction of additional taxes for road owners.
Among other things, the city's green five-year-old measures include the accelerated transition from the rest of the country to Euro-fuel standards, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and vehicle and fuel labelling, the restriction on the entry of cars to the central part of the city, the prohibition of the use of obsolete vehicles (other than the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles by hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed transport).
The Beijing road innovation also includes a ban on all private cars for movement within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the PRC) one day per week (relevant information is contained in the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for lottery-based vehicles (e.g. in 2011, the first year of lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only one third of the 2010 number).
According to the current State programme "Environment for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 41 per cent of all urban air pollution emissions were from "road sources."
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
In the Russian Federation, the possibilities of restricting cars on the streets of cities are still being considered.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the VSE, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel - a case known to be unpopular, can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of poorly sensitive to any regulatory effects - official and personal cars, as well as vehicles of "privileged" users with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total number of Moscow vehicles).
On the other hand, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between residential construction, road cover and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of researchers are that the centre of the city is provided twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking or just on the streets for a long time.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking but to expand but rather to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the protection zone of the historic centre (a total area of approximately 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologde will grow at once.
In the view of the city authorities, the increase in fines would help to bring order to Vologist and free the streets from the natural tents and lotches.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the products they produce often do not carry out related sanitary controls.
Which means the health of the witches is at stake.
For example, the lower limit for citizens for unauthorized trade has increased sixfold since November, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, and reports to the Press Service of the Vologist Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer credit and massive labour cuts.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which is almost non-smoking," said the Chief Economist Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grafe, who presented yesterday's quarterly report to the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage rise in Russia is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the cost-effectiveness of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent explained by Mr. Grafe.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it doesn't grow up, it could lead to dismissal and increased unemployment.
The main economist of Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantüshin, cannot raise the wages of the Russian business.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for employees is high.
Employers have to raise wages in order to lure or retain their current employees.
Russia ' s consumption of support is living and the demand for credit is growing very rapidly.
In the view of Mr. Grafe, this type of credit does not have a multiplier effect on the country ' s economy owing to the very high rates of consumer loans.
"The benefits to the economy of increasing the demand for credit have not been seen, the money is not divided by economy, but is returned to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the other problem is, Goldman Sachs is waiting for an increase in the backlog of unsatisfied loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to do with security.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returned," noted by Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
The director of the WSA Banking Institute, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to government banks, were forced to attract high-interest funds from the population.
In response, the government banks went to the path of war and began to lower credit rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot lend to the same interest, otherwise they will have negative interest margins.
If the government's banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is facing a full-fledged banking crisis, considering Vasily Solodkov.
In recent weeks, the economist has seen the denial of licences from a number of banks as a precursor to mass collapse.
"The state banks will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warns the head of the institution.
But the increase in consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investment bank, because of the failure to index the salaries of public servants and military personnel, as set out in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if investment is not raised (and the preconditions are not yet available, see the certificate), the increase in consumption will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantušin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a drop in the price of oil," he says.
He estimated that Russia's economy would begin to decline at a cost of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CBS has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradox: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise stakes.
This may mean that they didn't believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation." Clemens Grafe said.
The Central Bank ' s interest policy does not affect market rates, but only the interbank lending rates.
"For the CB, it's the collapse of all hopes," Clemens Grafe assessed.
Banks are not used to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means the funds are trying to speculate against the ruble.
"It will soon be understood that the strategy is not working," said Mr. Grafe, and recalled that the State planned to put the ruble in "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
But it's either gonna have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
According to his assessment, the ruble rate is now artificially over 10%.
Only one way to weaken is to draw the expert's conclusion.
But if the CB drops a shadow of doubt in the financialists that the elimination of the foreign exchange corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the rubbish, it can hit the ruble much stronger.
In Chelyabinsk, there were II meetings of the peoples of Southern Ural.
The Forum, in conjunction with the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies, a total of around 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We don't have any differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," claims Feofan, Mittropolit Chelyabinski and Zlataustsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
The Congress adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of operas and ballets.
This is where the exhibition was opened by the national cultural associations of the Chelyabin region.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the US intelligence issue.
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence reporter, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and his director Keith Alexander were unable to answer questions about his activities.
The German deputy Hans-Cristian Streubel met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it was stated: "With the result of my efforts manifestly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not give any protection."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the US Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the US and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group in charge of intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely," it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, MP from the Green Germany Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be "safe" there, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "hard and permanent" campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to "his political statements."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials - including in the United States - have found the uncontrollable system of comprehensive surveillance useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Frontier Airlines will charge a handhold fee
Frontier Airlines is planning to charge up to $100 passengers for carrying a handhold on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging up to $100 per hand deposit and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the whole bank.
The new handhold charges apply to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said he'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers were to pay only when they came to the landing.
Frontier Kate O'Malley's representative said that a $100 fee should make passengers take care of payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
The airline began charging for the first and second bag in its luggage in 2008.
Passengers attempting to avoid these charges are kicked as much as they can, into a hand deposit placed in the top luggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Collections are one way to force passengers to pass less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The point is that the most loyal clients in Frontier say that finding a place in the top luggage compartments is getting harder.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and the Frontier registration desk was intended to ensure that passengers would know about the assembly before they got to the landing.
The new collection of the Frontier for the handhold will not begin to be charged until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage is worth money, and the passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover air travel costs after several years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not apply to manual storage charges.
Sprit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand-cash charge three years ago, and another Discounter Allegian Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with this collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, and the airline consultant, J. Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra charges.
According to his assessment in the December 2011 report, the hand-cash fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was wondering if he would find himself at the landing when passengers were facing an unusual collection of Spirit for a handhold.
"The landing process was the coolest thing I saw for my career in airlines," he said.
I was expecting to see my teeth crawling and a fight at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows the Spirit in respect of a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who received soda or juice could keep the whole bank and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
She's still gonna give free water.
U.S. Airways tried to charge drink fees for a short time in 2008, but refused it seven months after passengers began complaining and no other large airline followed her example.
Frontier's manual deposit fee initiative, when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last step to attract clients to their website.
Air companies pay online tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to apply to the travel online agency.
However, Frontier went beyond all in this area.
In September, she began to give twice as much bonus miles to frequently flying customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut off the bonus number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of travel.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier acquired from an online travel agency would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is declining and becoming lost.
The revenue fell by 9 per cent and flight opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, as a result of the financial results published on Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames an internal error, not hackers, to close the site.
The secret National Security Agency announced on Friday evening that the closure of their website for several hours caused a technical breakdown, not hackers, as alleged on the network.
"NSA.gov was not available for several hours this evening because of the internal error that occurred during the scheduled update," the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed "service failure" attack [DoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
The NSA spokesman previously informed ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency "not" had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, and the representative informed.
At least one online group of hackers stated that it was responsible for the failure of the NSA website through DDoS attacks.
DDoS attacks are designed to sneak the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The hackers ' tactics are relatively simple, but attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the supersecret NSA, once known as "No Such Agency," has been at the centre of public attention and violent criticism in recent months, following a series of reports of its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and within the country, all of which are reactions to the secret files of the NSA stolen from the agency and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to the fact that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier ' s profits are declining with fewer deliveries and a number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday due to the reduced number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The company Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not published any data on the flight tests of its new CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether ambitious plans for commercialization of the aircraft will be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of an experienced sample of aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it only flew three times, raising questions as to whether the test phase was going through the schedule.
The results did not meet projections and led to a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorksen, National Bank Financial Analyst, reduced his assessment on Thursday from "over-average-market" to "average-market" because of the belief that interest growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
"If the reduction in the delivery of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the performance of the transport department," said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test programme continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot sample of aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are not yet too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight tests to verify the company ' s allegations of fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new plane.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements are now available with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Bowuan, was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
"The real model of the aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," said Bauduan during the telephone conference, adding that ground testing and software upgrades were planned for the time of the aircraft's simplicity.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break to update, so we did.
This will take place throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and all the others will follow him soon, as the company reported.
However, analysts are sceptical about the statement that the first client will be able to start operating CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the date of entry into service and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that entry will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015," said Dorksen.
In the third quarter of September 30th, the net income of Bombardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per action, from $172 million, or 9 cents per action last year.
The adjusted profits for the action remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
The analysts expected 10 cents of profits for the account and $4.56 billion for gross income, according to Thhomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world ' s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which was lower than the previous year ' s 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The fleet of orders from the Aerospace Division amounted to $32.9 billion by 30 September, without changing from 31 December.
"In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders and general market conditions became an unpleasant factor," said Bauduan.
Gross airfare income fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world ' s largest train producer, reported that gross revenues in this sector had increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit ' s purchase portfolio was $32.6 billion by 30 September, slightly higher than 31 December.
The revenue of the transport unit has been adversely affected by several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that Google's CEO Patrick Pichet would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4,83 to bid in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world ' s third largest commercial producer of aircraft and the nearest rival of Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on a lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics producer, Sony Corporation, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony ' s results from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected owing to the decline in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers for the Japanese corporation.
Sony's TV business, in the second quarter, the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss during the reporting period.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially because of lower demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial kits: the company's sales are growing at a high rate, especially through road systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to earn 179 billion yen operating profits against the estimated 230 billion yen in the past.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts assumed that the figure would be significantly higher and amounted to 221 billion yen.
To get out of the crisis, Sony's expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours was announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need for 100 times a day to get the smartphone out of its pocket.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and recovery forecast, the company ' s shares in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning, falling to 1,668 yen per action.
The gene of speech proved to be a catalyst for synapse education.
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have found protein, which has enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by promoting new links between neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be read briefly on the magazine's website.
Gene Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to the speech.
Its role was established in 2001 through the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes even understood each other.
Scientists found that the work of the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted by family members, but how it performed its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions as Foxp2 is acting as a catalyst for new brain synapses associated with speech formation.
He does so thanks to another genius, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 only on its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects the voculation has been confirmed by scientists in a mouse experiment.
When animals had artificially reduced gene activity, they were less critical when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds was restored.
Previously, there was also a connection to the radicalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals who were supplied with a human copy of the gene were fed more often and at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, consequently, its SRPX2 are linked to purely "mechanical" sound properties or to more subtle processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation is imprisoned
42-year-old Bashar Ditta gave information to the criminal authority of Neil Scarboro
Counsel was afraid his secret drug addiction would be solved.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A former lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation, because he was afraid to expose his clandestine drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Bashar Ditta gave Neil Scarborough's criminal authority secret information about his investigations into drug trafficking after being threatened by its cocaine dependence.
A lawyer named Bash and named among the criminals as a "counsel lawyer" was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarboro, which he had previously presented in a drug court.
The officers noticed that Scarboro, 32 years old, left three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at the bar's dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was "regularly using" Class A drug after the tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarboro, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police supervision during that time as part of a major investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Kambria, Mercisaide, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police had seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million in a series of raids, as well as over £200,000 in cash.
A 42-year-old Ditta gave information to criminals because of fear that his cocaine addiction would be solved.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditt, who works at Forbes Solicitors, a legal company located in Blackburn, was humiliated after his conviction in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer ' s disclosure occurred after Scarboro ' s follow-up police found out that he had spoken regularly with Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found out how he went to Ditt's house in Blackburn and put the drugs 60 percent clean in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash boxes.
Shortly after the broadcast, Scarboro met with Ditta, who was at the Iwood Park football stadium of Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine talks took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta "regularly used" cocaine after the tests found traces of Class A drug in his hair, wallet and his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he spoke to a suspect dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a "lawyer secret."
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to pull out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
At the police interrogation, he said that, along with the workplace, he had a home office, and the clients came to his home on legal matters.
However, the court learned that, following important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them that they were known by detectives.
In an indictment, Ann White said, "If anyone knows that there is no violation of the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close relationships with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the normal relationship between counsel and the client.
It has prevented police investigations as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but embarrassed her.
He was too close to certain clients, such as Scarboro, and he questioned his uninterest.
Ditta didn't confess guilt and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, to whom I am not, and I would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, Chief Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancaster Police said, "Mr. Dietha has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began buying drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him insecurely compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of criminal gangs, who have instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire confidence and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover his profession.
The investigation into the case of Mr. Ditta led the Lancashire Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already obtained a sentence for him in three cases of cocaine storage, and now an obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire for a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarboro himself was sentenced for 14 years after having confessed guilt in conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 men were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta arranged a question-and-answer conversation in which he said that his dream was a lawyer representing American clients with a death sentence, his perfect companion after dinner, Mohammed Ali, and his motivation for work was inequality.
The Yaroslava stadium is not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, noted by the police officers who attended the FRFC meeting today.
The ticket program is, in their view, about twice as high.
During the 1/16 match, the Russian Cup and Spartacus were used by only a thousand stewards under a rule of nine thousand.
Spartakov fans relied on 2,200 places, i.e. 10 per cent of the stadium ' s capacity, but, in agreement with the Moscow Club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was read by Arthur Grigoriantz, head of the CDC.
Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, a member of the United States Security Service who preferred not to reveal his name stated that the United States had listened to telephone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several points for audition in the rising sun country.
He noted, however, that the US, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not carry out intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, is the object of intelligence activities, has reported the NHK television channel.
This information has not yet been formally commented on by either party.
Remember, the news about the surveillance of U.S. intelligence services behind Chancellor FRG came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel's phone for the past 10 years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some reports, took the news of her wire very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed were the FRG and the US for decades, such surveillance of the Head of Government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was ready to share details about Angela Merkel's phone calls with the German Public Prosecutor's Office.
The German specifically flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria can put grains on the trade not before early 2014
In the course of public procurement interventions, the banker may not trade grains before the beginning of 2014, considered the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko to be the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the market price is higher, and there's demand.
"Possibly the grain will be put to the bidding after New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in 2013 crop crops were 3.1 million hectares, including 1.7 million hectares of cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
Under the 2014 harvest, 550,000 ha (of 105,000 ha more than in 2012) were planted.
The area under the osimium wheat and triticale has been increased, and the birth has remained at the same level.
There's no Bratt Circle in the Ministry of Internal Affairs bases, which Leps was assigned to in the United States.
In the databases of Russian forces of the Bratt Circle, to which Washington listed Grigori Leps, it does not mean.
According to Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports of the United States Department of Finance ' s listing of Grigori Leps on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate " Brat Circle " , all databases were verified, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia," which is allegedly operating abroad, is considered in the power structures.
"Even in the very name, "Brat Circle," there's some element of mystery that contains a hint of a secret lie.
"It's like a piar action," said the agency's interviewer.
On 31 October, the U.S. Department of Finance announced that it would be placed on its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate Arthur Badalian, Grigori Lepsveridze, Vadima Lalina, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Slykov.
The Litz on this list is suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who have been considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "works as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Lontierev."
At Grigory Leps' production centre, he refused to comment on the U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "brid."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama took the Brat Circle syndicate as a "existing transnational organized criminal group" and instructed the miniphine to "react and prevent their global criminal operations."
The placing of a person on the black list of U.S. miniphine has resulted in the freezing of its assets in the U.S. and the prohibition of dealing with him by persons living in the United States.
Scandal video hit the police.
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known as his scandalous and frankly reckless exits, was on crack smoking.
The Canadian City police stated that they had a video record and were ready to start an investigation against the local commander.
He said he wouldn't leave his post, told CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the personnel with the public, but that he was responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, Rob Ford's compromising video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by guards around the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor himself gives no comment on this.
He only says it's not his fault and he's not going to resign.
The video footage found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford Alexander Lisey, a 35-year-old friend who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal income and conspiracy.
At times, Lisey was a driver of Rob Ford.
The residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He had repeatedly fought journalists, appeared drunk in the public, allowing himself to speak racistly and sexistly.
Rostovaeroinvest has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender at the choice of the designer of the facility.
Rostovaeroinvest's contract is not disclosed.
According to the OAO press service, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the State Expert Office in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and airport upgrading elements.
In the first stage of construction, the terminal area will be 50,000 square metres, and it may be increased further.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers and by 2035 6 million passengers.
By the time of the results of the tender, the architectural concept of the Southern Aero-oxidal Complex, developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov and Don and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, the company designed terminals C and E of the International Airport of Sheremeevo and a new aerosol complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladi East.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Axai district of Rostov province and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed and eventually integrated into the urban construction.
The construction of the aerosol complex is scheduled to begin in 2014 and the introduction of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
The Turkish politician declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria.
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of the town of Nusaybin in south-east Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the prosecution party of the MPD have strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaybin Aisha Hekhan, on the border with Syria, declared a hunger strike in protest against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, informed RIA Novosti in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMP) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly launched protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaybina Aisha Hekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," stated in the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is a inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree with," quoted by Aisha Hekhan of the party's representatives.
According to the press, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will establish a rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, a bolívar, against a dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange a year equivalent to ten thousand United States dollars.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific course of the bolívar vis-à-vis the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to deflate local currency to 6.3 bolvars per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolívars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolívar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to deflate the bolívar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to reduce the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing the prices of products and products of broad consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, had led to a lack of a number of products and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that Venezuela had noted a shortage of toilet paper.
The South Director, Andrei Belmach, noted that it was still difficult to say how long it would take to find a new chief coach.
This post became vacant after Sergei Shepeleva's resignation.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how long it takes to find a new coach, I'm not ready, gives ITAR-TASS the words of Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a coach, but a man who's gonna work at our club for years and get some results with him.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
"It's a terrible place, and there's reason to ask, what might prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" reported the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said that the new media court "will always be biased because it is a continuation of the Government" and restrictions on content and advertising would harm the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially enable the Government to "take a dead grip" and the Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had "gotten a serious blow" and criticized the bill as "draconovsky."
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities ' anger by broadcasting surveillance footage where troops who had been sent to the scene of the attack were allegedly robbing a expensive shopping centre.
The reaction of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was to call two journalists and media officials for questioning, although the challenge was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists may be fined up to one million with an additional risk of being off the list, i.e., a ban on obtaining official journalism accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations."
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called "living blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians understand that by keeping the media quiet, they can do whatever they think they're gonna do with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote journalist Nation Mutum Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
"The politicians themselves will tear the country apart and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the reductions imposed by the National Wage Commission and the restoration of their huge salary of some 532,000 shillings per month without taxes, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new line of expenditure in the utility payments of the crows, which will be paid for the major maintenance of the house.
The most approximate calculation for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay between 100 and 400 roubles a month.
A precise standard will be established by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, put the stairwell cells in order, or even replace the elevator, the tenants will decide.
Such a law has been approved by the deputies of the district thought.
Vladimir Keynikov, President of the Voronage Regional Think, said: "In this case, too, it is necessary to establish order - to establish the order of the house repair, to accumulate funds not in the company's managers - which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, somewhere else, it will be the establishment of State control over the spending of funds collected by residents for the renovation of multi-family homes."
Under the control of the State, there is also a good building.
The law protecting against fraudsters was approved by a blanket in final reading.
The document wasn't born in an empty place.
In our region, 45,000 people have suffered from dishonest builders.
The problems of the majority have been resolved.
By the way, the new law sets out rights and obligations for all participants in the field construction.
Vladimir Keynikov, President of the Voronage Regional Think, said: "It is not a secret that abuses also began in this area because of the fact that in the '98s, the travelers were the same and in the 2000s the same travelers."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary detention centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament has adopted such a law not only under pressure from the Federation.
Problems related to illegal migrants in the region are at least addressed.
For example, in the past year, the migration record had risen to just over 100,000 foreigners.
But only one in five made an official work permit.
Where the others are working and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Keynikov, President of the Voronage Regional Think, said: "They have violated the law but are not criminals."
There's no court, and we have to deport them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation to make such facilities available through regional means.
In the Voronje region, this is the old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
Well, lastly, the regional parliament has given new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same is true for many children.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt 3 or more babies will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
Each family member has a new law of 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 metres per metre.
The family, for example, of six people - Dad, Mama, Mother, Child and the 3rd - Adoption.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires a housing area of 108 square metres - 3 million 300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the south-west neighbourhood, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the center for this amount.

U.S. Secretary of State: Special Services sometimes went too far in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and wires, American intelligence services sometimes " went too far," however, the politician pointed out that the news of 70 million people in the media was not true.
I assure you that innocent people have not been hurt in this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yeah, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I admit it, as the President admits... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future," quoted Secretary of State AFP.
Italian employees who have completed their years of service are taking the young way.
Italian unemployment beats records.
Data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s inhabitants are now unemployed.
So bad things haven't happened since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population between 15 and 24 years of age are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and the laws enacted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for staff with seniority.
On the other hand, Italy is waiting for an ageing population in Europe.
And economists aren't sure they're gonna get better with premature staff rotations.
What the construction of a TPU in Moscow will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more transport and transplant units (TPRs).
By 2020, 255 TPUs are planned for implementation.
What's actually going on with the project, we've been dealing with the correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence broke out at the Smolenian Arbatsk-Postro subway.
The inscription stated that a transport and transplant unit was being installed.
All of this was very strange, as no ground transport stops near Smolen and therefore cannot be crossed into it.
In order to get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sadow ring, we have to overcome about 130 metres, including the ground crossing through the Cmanice Line.
Smolen's almost finished now.
The flower lark disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt changed in front of the entrance.
That's the whole transport knot.
Transport and transplants are flat and capital, explained in the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
Capital TPUs are not yet available.
The flats involve the construction of parks, the withdrawal of trade facilities that prevent the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, flat TPPs are not even transporters, but professional gracers from the capital repair department of Moscow City.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there's enough roofs over the head and a tab that alerts the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a fully-fledged flat transplant node.
Let's have no curtains, but with exciting parking and a tab indicating when the bus arrives.
But in pursuit of the number of officials, they're recording everything in the TPU.
As early as 2011, the mayors planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
The plans for 2020 now include 255 TPUs.
One and a half of them promise to surrender this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of the TPU, no qualitative criteria have been identified, Alexander Morozov notes the co-chair of the city and transport community organization.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant on each of them is often deteriorating.
The criteria, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, a reduction in transplant time, and second, comfort.
First of all, it's possible to change the mode of transport without raining.
In Moscow, however, at the time of the establishment of the TPU, it is sometimes quite the opposite.
It's a bright example of a subway of "TERNAH."
In the past, suburban buses from the Jaroslav Highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VCE.
Now they've been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Next to the subway, much further from the monorails, but closer to the residential houses.
It's a gift that the residents didn't want a car station under the windows and complained to every possible authority.
The capital TPUs in Moscow weren't asked at once.
The first one started building five years ago at the planetary subway.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And there's really a sample of how a transplant knot that's paid off to investors turns into a banana mall.
No, there are bus fares, curtains to avoid the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
Indeed, the HIMK Trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU did not have a place in principle.
They're like strangers moving away from the subway.
But there's more to trade.
It's just 32 stores, and almost everything is from zoos to car salon.
Well, actually, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the road?
We always have a mall when the capital TPU is built.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot decided to market.
Now, on the third floor of the TPU, the Planner is running a violent trade among the floor parking spaces.
The vegetables, the spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-Russian speech, and the guards, who look angry at our photographer.
The transplant knot has finally turned into a bastard.
The thing is, the planetary subway used to have a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants regretted and let in the transponder park the transplant node.
It's always empty because of high prices.
The funny thing is, the market's been blown down to build a new flat TPU in his place.
That's the rocking.
The subway "Kalu" has a distance of 50 metres from the subway to the bus, " says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the Trade Centre, it is alleged that the distance has increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to walk it under the open sky.
However, the design on the Planet and the Cavulsky will soon appear to be flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the Mayor approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPNs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, excluding two or three underground longlines.
The main monster will grow at the Tushino subway, with 418,700 square metres of space.
The representatives of the RZZ railway station in charge of the construction of the TPU at the subway have already told journalists that shops, hotels and apartments will be available in future events.
At the same time, the officials believe that the multi-layered parking lot will take one third to one half of the area.
Let's take an example of "people's" garages.
Let's say that the 258 car-place garage that recently built on the International Street has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So the parking of 26,000 cars from Petrosco-Razumovsky will require about 80,000 "quadrats."
It's less than a third of the machin that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all the bus fares.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate left.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GOMAs.
If railway stations and station stations build the capital TPOs, the rest of the sites will be developed by sub-urbans.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional objects," including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in Moscow City's Department of Property, journalists have recently been told that they are developing a draft regulation that allows investors to apply for a site for TPOs directly to officials.
No contests.
Because, say, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The perfect TPU is, for example, the Garvard station in Boston or the "Spain" in Toronto, and I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trams go down to the subway level and the distance between the subway wagon and the tram is only 50 metres without exit.
There's no extra trade around here.
But Moscow's officials are overruled.
Either we don't build anything or we're gonna kill 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser suggests that extremism be equated with an insult to patriotic feelings.
For the legislative protection of the patriotic feelings of citizens against Russian provocations and insults, "A just Russia" suggests that the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities be equated and punished for five years in prison.
According to the news newspaper, such legislative amendments, prepared by the ad hoc Thought Committee on Energy, Oleg Miheyev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person to a country of which he is a citizen, a country with love for that country, responsible for her fate, respect for her history and culture.
According to Miheev, there are sanctions in domestic legislation for abuse of the formal characteristics of State authority - the flag and the herb.
However, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be clouded by insults of State symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
He cited, as an example, the debate that had been launched every year on the eve of the Day of Victory, when some media officers allowed themselves to question the heroic attitude of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, the Day of Victory on 9 May, a real vakhanalia is unfolding every year.
In a sense of urgency and a "alternaive view" in history, some publicists come to the thought that it is a pity that the cultural Germans have not won a wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "suffering nation" - outraged by Oleg Miheev.
Moreover, according to Miheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious ones, but the law punishes insulting the feelings of the believers and insulting patriotic feelings can almost be punished with impunity.
In the view of the popular elector, it is necessary to equate the insults of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate penalties in the 282nd article of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from 100 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The earthquake of magnetud occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the district of Kokimbo in central Chile, and is being transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as specified on the United States Geological Survey website (USGS).
It was recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November Moscow).
Victims or subsurface destruction have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 earthquake and its tsunami killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960 it recorded a magnetoid of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of the disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be considered in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee law enforcement," said Dmitri Medvedev in a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanya, like the rest of the activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted "RIA News" by Mr. Ero.
"Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," stated Dmitri Medvedev in turn.
He said that any structures that attempted to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "like a powder barrel" and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting "RIA News."
UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately begin working on a new set of tasks to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the 2015 MDGs before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro last night.
They were included in the outcome document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit this evening that it was time to "get above national interests."
"I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and take over the process of establishing the universal sustainable development goals - the CSD," he said.
These MDGs will build on our progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concerns about security in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of powerful people
Under the above-mentioned statue of Samra Machel, President of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scan the slogans of peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed the business costume to a T-shirt, painted with the inscription "We Demand Security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday on the Metropolitan Area of Independence.
Within two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo - one of the most brutal clashes since the truce over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era, as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the truce of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents to become nervous.
The rates are high for a fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the north-west can attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Fremo's ruling party, leading the political force since 1975, and Renamo's party has accused each other of creating tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has become the decorator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sophala province, the traditional Renamo raft, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, told the newspaper Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, the representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears about instability.
Gebuza said to the French news agency, on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhlalam felt like a "discussor" who wanted to use "all that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government."
Both Flimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears have increased since the report that Mazzanga has declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times what he meant to be in non-compliance with the Freemo party agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have intensified a series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful men (Gebuza and Dhlalam) facing foreheads," said Joseph Hannon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has declined since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is founded by former Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who had to resign next year when his second term was over, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is not clear how Renamo is capable, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway from the north to the south.
Most clashes took place in Sophala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Bayru, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened the railway with an attack.
Mazanga was evasive when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Unstability has increased the Government ' s dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent Media Company Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration participant, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Freemo, they just want a resumption of peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
The Art-Meinström series will take place in Moscow.
A series of art-meynsterim films, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they go to the rental, will take place at the Rolla cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports to RIA News, citing the project organizers.
Opens the Art-Mainström program, the French director's comedy and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost."
This is a story about the Maye model in the French capital, which, due to visa problems, is being deported to Morocco.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also see a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duke "Mebius," the melodramatic bike of Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: A History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Canna Film Festival "Life Adele" Abdelatif Keš.
The only Russian member of Art-Mainsterima will be the winner of Alexander Veledine's film "Geograph Globes" at the Kinotavre Festival on the basis of a single novel by Alexei Ivanov.
Constantin Habensky played the main role of Victor Poskin's outstanding teacher, whose work was also marked by the Kinotaur prize.
Children should study myths and legends as "life models," the author says.
The Torah stories could show that "the rough power cannot defeat the sophisticated trick" and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
According to the fact that many myths will be too wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too indecent to teach in schools," Cross-Holland is in favour of "savourful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the "extreme morality" of authors and teachers was "distinguishing interest" in children, and the basic ideas were "attached" in fascinating stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English-Saxon language, and also wrote the Norwegian Myths collection for Penguin and British People's Tales, said, "You may have intentions, but you'd better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there must be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it's revealed through history, not clearly defined.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In the Voronje region, a football fan was detained, breaking a window in the waiting room at the station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans, natives of the Moscow region, were removed by transport police officers from the passenger train at the Gryzi-Voronezh station.
On their way to the game of a favorite team, the guys on their way made a drunk debo on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty station of the Police Line Office at the Gurzi station to draw up an administrative offence protocol.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The cops put administrative material on them and let them go.
Young people bought tickets for the next train, and at the station the station was waiting for him to arrive.
At half the first night the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old guy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window in the waiting room at the station.
An officer of the transport police and a PMSC guard of the RZhD broke the glass.
They were able to detain an intruder who was trying to escape from the scene.
The officers of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are conducting an inspection.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being raised, and the senior representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of South-East L.A. in the transport of Sergei Olhovik has been informed.
Vitaly Mutko: Vodettes?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, expressed his opinion on the disturbances on the rostrum during the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - Spartacus.
I'm in favour of all of this being responsible for organizing sports events: clubs, leagues, Russian Federation.
But we can see that they've taken the wrong position.
They're waiting for someone to come from the outside and make the order.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite the right thing to do.
We need to organize fans, clubs have to invite their stewards, not let the case go for self-defense.
We have now drawn up a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in the stadiums.
Once adopted, we will deal with this problem.
But I'm still gonna invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
State, let's do the law quickly.
It feels like they're the Bavaria fans in Jaroslavl, and they're all doing it.
And we're the opposing observers.
In fact, it's awful to see the tribun plumbing out of the bradspoy.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia
The U.S. ex-employee Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on the phone calls of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure outside Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by U.S. allies," said the agency's interviewer.
"In addition, in principle, the General Prosecutor's Office of the FRG could send representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the matter should be developed at the inter-State level.
Formerly, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to testify on the United States intelligence services negotiating the Chancellor of Germany.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
An ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S.A.A. blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, in order to do so, all the conditions of his arrival must be clearly defined," Strebel informed the Euronews television channel.
Snouden Anatoli Kucheren's lawyer, commenting on the statement by the Interfax source, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how would be decided by himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANS) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, and then released information on the U.S. intelligence surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities who charged him with serious charges in absentia and remained in the Sheremeevo airport transit zone until early August.
On August 1, Snouden received a paper on granting him temporary asylum in Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sheremeevo on the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, stated that his client was working for a "large Russian company."
The NSA surveillance of Angel Merkel last week was reported by German media.
According to journalists, telephone conversations by the Chancellor of the United States began to be heard as early as 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing these information, stated that Merkel's surveillance violated German laws and sovereignty.
Pomomari has left "A Fair Russia"
A member of the State Duma from the Justice Russia Party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilia Ponovarev, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he applied to the party ' s New Siberian Regional Office.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "fairbros."
We're sitting, drinking tea...
"Why a lot of people want to see the picture of "Ilia Ponomarev puts on the table a partnership," but there's nothing so epochal about it, " commented the deputy.
Pomomari noted that he maintained a good relationship with the Regional Unit of Eser.
However, the mandate of Mr. Gosdum Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up.
He explained that, despite his departure from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not legally withdraw from it.
Reports of the intention of Ilí Ponoarewa to leave the party "A Fair Russia" appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Hudkov and Valery Zubov would come out with him from the RS, but the latter soon denied that information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of Japanese MD Fumio Kisida met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"Welcomes to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," said at Kisid's meeting.
The Foreign Minister of Japan recalled that, since Prime Minister Sinzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries had become more warm and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would welcome Japan in dealing with complex political issues, wrote the RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies resolving the issue of disputed Northern Territories.
In that regard, Tokyo is currently protesting for the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
The Japanese capital drives cars from which it says, "Bring back the northern territories!"
The police don't stop protesters, they're watching to keep the noise level up.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
You can be bold to say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, Frank Faye, an artist who worked as a conference at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's news was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hursh, founder of the Caroline stand club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"The majority of these hedliners started in Carolines, and then made more success, reached a level when they were already too famous to be at the club," said Hursh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year ' s event includes presentations by Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Stendap for heroes" - an annual music and community concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comics participating in this year's festival have become popular in an unconventional way, for example through a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known for his role in the comedy show on a poorly-known cable channel (the FXX scrubbed "Liga" on FXX on the subject of fentezi football), and now he's running his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slat was part of an actor's team both on the "Subbot Night live" and on the "Pary and Rest Zone," although it is most commonly known in a series of viral videos, "Marseille is a cancer in boots."
Both Kroll and Slat, like other young self - style comedians, are the result of a decentralized American comedy world.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedy, but then became a successful director on television and film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the central element of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks around some kind of snack between the two houses and he thinks, "This is if I stay completely without money, maybe I'll live here."
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country to the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Navaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Prime Nick Clegg with whom he discussed Pakistan ' s and India ' s relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue should be made in accordance with Pakistan's constitution."
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Pakistan) are allies of the single Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-western areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistan ' s Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously attempted to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had refused dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities took the troops deployed in the Taliban-held areas to permanent locations and released arrested Islamists from prisons.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell at a price of $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns over the formation of large stocks were overshadowed by a message showing that China ' s energy-intensive production sector is gaining momentum.
The United States reference oil class in December's delivery was 14 cents, with a price of $96.24 per barrel later in the morning of European time in electronic bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, representing a fall of 5.8 per cent in the price of October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the stock increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was a reference to a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery can continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent - the reference class of international oil, also used by United States oil refineries - has increased by 26 cents to $1008.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The Chief Colorado Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the Holquiper Semen Varlamov from the first minute in a Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night in prison did not undermine his confidence in the Russians, handing over from Dallas the Sobor "SEA" Natalia Schmeleva.
And what we're waiting for, Rua said after the morning breakup, "Lavin."
Of course, what happened is bothering us all, but we're sure about it and feel that it's gonna be good for him to go to ice today.
We want him to go to the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation hasn't affected the gatekeeper's conditions?
I'll see you tonight.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him protect the gate, as was the case in the previous matches of this season.
Most importantly, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the trial is resolved.
In Siberia, you don't have to be a vegan. The warm tomato won't replace the soup.
Why vegetarianism isn't fit for life in Siberia, she found out the correspondent RIA News.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
They can't move the winter without health loss, and no heat tomatoes will compensate them, they think the New Siberian dietists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Végan's Day.
Drink oil with litres
Strict vegetarianism, when it turns away not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, forensic doctors are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, such strict standards of nutrition are not at least useful to health.
Total abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for vegetation.
You have to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," I'm sure Marina Godi is a dietologist.
It gives an example of fish containing the indispensable grease acid Omega-3.
Their richest vegetable oil is lynx.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a man, you need to drink liters!" says the dieter.
Medicians are confident that the people of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly called into question.
With our realities, there are high demands for food.
To avoid freezing, you need increased calories.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, he does not understand that calorie, respectively," the expert says.
That's what Olga Poznyak's Dytheologist agrees with.
She adds that brought vegetables and fruit are not a way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to make better use of these products.
And in winter, people want not a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more, " explains their doctor's position.
According to her, there are vegans that are really useful for various grains, choppers, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries.
But it's certainly not enough for a complete diet.
According to a gastroenterologist Clavedia Arifulina, the vitamin level in the organisms is sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees in 24 hours and snow in May, is unsuspectable.
The body needs energy for life, and this, above all, is fat, says medicine.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acid.
And with vegetarians, we give them to the imperfect.
Pregnant people also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans miss them," I'm sure God.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, "to play those toys that he wants."
He's got an already formed organism, a skeleton, organs.
Still, children must be fully fed.
If parents deprive him of any microcells or amino acid by choosing for him what he's gonna eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substance to develop the brain, the vision, the bones will not be recovered tomorrow," she says.
All medical professionals interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-growing greenhouses and vegetables and fruit.
What is brought to us and grown up in the greenhouses contains fewer micro-nutrients that we need than (created) in the open ground.
"The quality of the produce is wrong," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to produce more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and plumber, tomatoes tasteless and non-aromat," gives examples of medics, adding that they are likely to be filled with excess fertilizer.
And they become suppliers of cells, not vitamins.
This does not agree with the environs of the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology for Agrarian Problems, the candidate for agricultural science, Vera Petruk.
She said that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses, full-scale vegetables could be grown.
If they try to drive more from a square metre, of course, they will plant more often and re-feed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow fast, they are large, but watery and poor," she explains, adding that the quality issue depends first and foremost on the conscience of the producer.
The Court suspended the enforcement of the decision on "stop-and-search" practice in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of the judgement requiring changes in the New York Police Department's "stop-and-search" programme and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second District Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheinlin would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in the manner in which he had carried out a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including the order to appoint a supervisor to help the police office change its work practices and related training programmes.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal argued that the judge should be dismissed because she violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the Court ' s criticism.
The judge ruled that the police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, making it unreasonable for blacks and Latin Americans under the "stop-and-search" programme.
It appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, which include political, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most of the detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing names and addresses of persons whose cases had been terminated after police review.
The town ' s appeal debate is due after 14 March 2014.
The "stop and search" tactics were criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
The "stop search" has been in some form for decades, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically in the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of which are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of the change in the "stop-and-search" programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, shape a more reliable and effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morale rather than crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions owing to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of "stop-and-searching" that was in line with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Thirdkov Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third Kosovo Gallery and occupies a section of two kilometres from the station of Novokuzskaya to the Bolot Square.
Street tors, flowerers, benches, urns and toilets have been installed throughout the entire period, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to Clementovsky and the Lavrushian alleys, which had already been walking, five streets - Ordian impasse, the Greater and Small Tolmacheva alley, the Kadashev Coastal and Balot Square - have been closed for cars.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the 5th Street section, from the Novokuzskaya station's lobby to the Clementian Alley, the conditions for pedestrians created without the removal and cutting of the carriageway, transmits newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian area, there was a third-class gallery, the temple of the priest of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the entire pedestrian was the Tver passage, the Strawshoppers, and the Kuznetsk Bridge street.
The big Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hack to check a confidential message.
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used a telephone, surveillance and confrontation fracture in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Crown Counsel Andrew Edice, informed the court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had received the untrue news that Clark was meeting with his "advisory special adviser" Hanna Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkeira to hack Paulby's voicemail and put her in the house to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemails, heard the court.
"The prosecution thinks that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, isn't the person who's gonna be standing near someone's house hoping to catch someone up, he's a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edice.
He said that the News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: breaking phones, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumors about Clark's novel first drew attention to the version of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The tape, with voice messages received from her phone at least three times, was removed from the Mulkeira house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective's computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects."
During the period she was under surveillance, her grandmother and her grandfather, Ms. Polby, received anonymous calls requesting information about her, said Mr. Edice.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbek and former reporter James Weatherap controlled Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we're planning to publish tomorrow and which I would like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edice said that Coulson's participation in this story had taken place in the same scenario as other influential people, such as the former Minister of the Interior, David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson joined the confrontation with Mr. Blanket about the affair with a married woman while he met with Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to conspire with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeir, Turlbek and Weserap confessed to breaking their phones.
Snowden is willing to speak to the authorities of the FRG in the wire case.
The ex-CIA officer Edward Snowden is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the FRG, transmits RIA News.
A letter from the former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented the deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebele, through which Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured by fire on the River Street
As a result of the burning in the collector in the centre of Moscow, four people were injured on the River Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, a passer was injured during a fire in an assailant underground crossing.
As RIA News states with reference to Paul Livinsky, head of the capital fuel and energy department, electricity is now fully restored in all houses on the River Street.
Fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was a severe smoke from the lunar sewers, and a smoke was retrieved at the underground crossing near the Armenian store.
As a result of the burning, 11 houses on the Tver Street were demolished.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was cleared.
US cuts food aid for the poor
Nutrition allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the United States has reduced its financial support for food stamps known as "fedstamps" since the Government's programme ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be 36 dollars a month less than previously reported by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuter, in fiscal year 2012, one person ' s allowance averaged $133 per month.
Food aid expenditure in the US increased to $80 billion per year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid from the "fudstamps" that has been wearing that name since the previous days when they were wearing paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress require further cuts in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Food store owners throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congresses continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge.
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC.
That's what WoW Insider reports.
According to his data, the game became available at Battle.net in the Blizzard classic game section.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts relate to the American part of the service are currently able to download it.
The game is not yet available to Russian users.
As the media transmits, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES cones.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlack decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is Vlaros Kyle's son, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Sarlack's pawns and protect the world's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game that the studio released after being renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow subway.
But selling tickets to passengers isn't gonna be for money, it's for being seated.
One trip at a cost of 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of seats will read out a special device using modern technology, and ITAR-TASS will report with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
The President of Russia's Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and the Olympic Champions of the Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodkov Gymnastics, will take part in the presentation of new tickets.
The National Security Agency ' s recognition of corporate paranoia in relation to State surveillance
A German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the German capital, in a warm day in late August.
According to instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV was hoping to locate the antennas of listening devices, which led to negotiations between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. National Intelligence Director, once again assured in September that the US did not use foreign intelligence "to kidnap foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to improve their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a disclosure agent, has started publishing his treasurer of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the US National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and obtained access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised corporate paranoia caused by State surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was to report that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been listening for perhaps about 10 years.
If Europe's most influential character can be targeted, then of course, business leaders are potential targets.
Snowden has clearly made intensive cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grun, president of the BITMI association, representing the German small and medium IT company.
German companies are convinced that the US now represents almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and theft of data, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
In all of Mr. Snowden ' s documents, however, there was still no evidence that the US had transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are sceptical about it.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of a German software supplier for SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have allowed it to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Except for the IT industry.
And yet, the scope and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, known as Snowden's revelations, was a shock to some companies that had previously thought China was the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company leaders have better realized that data stored in the US are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by Claude Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants have abandoned plans to use the United States cloud service provider after the discovery of the American programme for intellectual data analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and if you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that recent reports are merely evidence that they have already known: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What happens in economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always happened.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," said Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Director of the BASF chemical company.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we're spying on them, too, because it's part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the responses they have taken, as this can give the enemy the advantage.
In large companies, the idea of taking a free flash drive on the exhibit or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room has long been taken into account, at least unattended.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi automobile company, said that for many years it had been standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently dropped.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," warns in the BfV report.
The US alerts its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The United States National Intelligence Report in February placed France with Russia and Israel in the second series of hackers after China, approving the Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly stated in an interview this month: "The servants know well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a teen from Georgia who died in "unbelievable accident" believe that their son was killed.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia whose body was found inside a broken sports mat in the sports hall of his high school believe that their son was murdered and their family lawyer stated on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdost of Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical moth, which was placed behind the rostrum at his high school sports hall.
Investigators of the Loundez County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old adolescent challenged it.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Crum, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he was dead the way the sheriff says.
"They think it's contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and the sense of reason," said Crap.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a corpse bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna study all the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "position asphyxiation."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
"There are several questions that should be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the County Sheriff ' s Office in Loundez was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, South Georgia's judge ordered the authorities to publish all video footage of the surveillance cameras that the investigators were looking at.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the videos contained a key to the discovery of how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about the faces that put up the fascist symbol
On the official website of Spartacus, a statement was made by the Moscow Club regarding the appearance of a fascist flag on the rostrum in Jaroslavla.
On 30 October, the "Spartacus" was played by a fascist symbol at the Yaroslavla stadium.
We ask anyone who has reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
"The reward is guaranteed," as stated in the statement.
Searching for fans who posted a fascist flag in Jaroslavla
We recall that in the 1/16 match, the Spartacus Cup of Russia was interrupted several times due to disturbances on the rostrum.
Also in the Spartacus fans sector, a fascist symbol was shown.
As a punishment, Spartacus can perform about three matches without viewers.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried this symbol and posted it, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for schools on child allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of children ' s food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. Government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 kids in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff about child food allergies and how to assist in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools maintain adrenalin stocks - most often injecting EpiPen ' s automatic medical syringe - to assist with potentially fatal anaphylacticization.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make adrenalin stocks with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Kids can say, "It's like something's in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair in my tongue" or "speaker music."
The parents of intersex children can choose "undefined sex"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate-type external sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer be required to write a male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call a sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate sex as "undefined" or "undefined" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who could make quick decisions on the sex transfer operation to newborns and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to BBC, said years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna stay a doctor-made spooky piece with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the two thousand children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of the approximately 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as "sex abuse" - a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or semens) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersexual.
Gender identification is still under-examined, but most experts in the United States say that if the floor cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to assign it than to wait and monitor the child ' s psychological and physical development prior to the operation, if any.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law sounds like a good idea.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require rapid intervention, but most children do not have them," he said.
You can assign floors without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
Science about how a child's gender identity grows is not too precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their condition is not related to the gender but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively in line with either male or female sex, but is typical of both at the same time or is not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics may be shown in secondary sex topics, such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, chest and bodyization; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, Australia ' s 52-year-old, Norrie May-Walby, became the world ' s first-ever man to be declared "uncomplete" in court, granting the right to retain "undefined" sexual status for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F-X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to the news release on Channel France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also disagreed with the German law by stating that "in a situation where the world is attracted to a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are reversing two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to have sex at birth.
"Giveing up a child is hard enough and without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said a website for her parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with men and women's sexual organs were called hermophrodites, called the beautiful Greek God, who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And another ten years ago, the medical community took the gender as a leaf that could erase everything and then draw again.
But now many challenge ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "an urgent psychiatric incident," said Drescher.
When those kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was offered by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easily changed.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social - how parents grow up a child - interact with the child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself to be a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis had been damaged during the sloppy circumcision, to cast a child completely, also to remove his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it wasn't," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38 years old, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "applying this model" right now.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these sex change operations claimed themselves to be "unsettled results."
That was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY men's chromosomes but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors were unable to determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, the external sexual organ and Bruce's testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started giving women hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was appointed a vaginoplasty.
But when he was depressed and realized something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, getting testosterone shots and removing his breasts.
The surgery made him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people with intersexuality to normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, Executive Director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "probates the glimmering of labels and stigma."
Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and give the child an "undefined floor," she said.
We're afraid he'll help me get involved.
We think it's better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we haven't seen this law yet, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar-Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because "he allows adults to choose for the third sex."
"Grown people must be able to make their own decisions about formal sex," she says.
German law implies its attribution at birth.
It is a battle that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg mammaologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law would "support" both parents and children.
Baraz's daughter, Kathy, was born with men's chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "Clear Insensitive to Androgens."
Because her anthropogenic receptors aren't working properly, Katie's signs have developed.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at 29 years old, Katie is married, and she's a resident of child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hoped to become a parent through adoption or hestical surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make quick decisions by themselves," said Baraz.
He's giving them time to do some tests and to figure out the situation, as well as the time before they write "mojo" or "women."
In that case, you're fine, raise the baby, love the baby.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that parents are driving because they don't feel what they're doing right," she said.
After all, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with - and that's wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
Chicago's gate, Nikolai Habibulin, emphasized that he understood that he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two meetings of the Habibulin Jastrobs, he first missed six hits from Tampa Bay, followed by four from Ottawa, and replaced in the second game after the fourth missed balloon.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed, CSNChicago says Habibulin.
- I've got to find confidence in practice, maybe we should approach them as games, and try to achieve a better outcome.
You must study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been encountered.
There are some small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good at practice.
But somehow, after a few heads, things turn into some kind of snowy coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
Vratari - I don't think I'm the only one - always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I don't like it.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so much pussy.
Well, it's great that my same clubs support, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
Altaa's bus was turned over.
In the Rubtsov district of the Altai province, a PAZ bus was rotated.
As a result of the accident, 13 people were reported to the regional office of the MES, as clarified.
The region ' s law enforcement authorities had previously reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred about 9 a.m. local time on the Newnicolaevka-Wishnevka road, 1 km from Novonikolaevka.
The bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevk had 12 passengers and a driver, all suffered injuries of varying degrees of gravity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were brought to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, and two were hospitalized at Rubtsovsk CRS.
The bears expect the SSJ-100 aircraft to be shipped to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 aircraft to be shipped to Europe once the Latin American and Asian markets are in place.
"We expect a total of more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type" to be agreed upon by the Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, at a press conference with the French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will ever be delivered to France," stressed the Russian premiere.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the Civil aircraft of Sukhumi in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The lighter is based on modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger places.
Dnepropetrovskian energy started a unique rescue program... the aisle nest.
In the old days, to get to the arist yard, the high poles set a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been put in place for a long time, so the aistes have loved the lines of the transmission lines - the interlocked branches rely on wires, so that the austic house is safe.
Anya's grandmother, near his home in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrokov region, has been living in an Austic family for twenty years, and has noticed how the nest settles despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new vetoes upstairs, and the bottom layer has already passed between wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of the arists that were nested at the back of each year, taken out and fed three to four chicks in the summer, but I don't want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Grandma Anya called the King's REC, which belongs to the pillar.
I didn't even expect to react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, told DTEC's technical director, "Dneproblenergo," Sergei Berezovsky.
On wires that were actually already inside a nest weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, birds could have died of electric discharge.
And the locals risked being left out of sight because of damage to the wires.
So the linear monsters started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornitologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University were helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They did training for district network staff.
Alexander Ponomarenko, known as the bottompropetrovskian ornitologist, advised the energyists at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 Austic apartments in the area of emergency.
Special metal platforms that resemble the crow were welded for their reconstruction.
The basics were splintered by the hams, and then moved the old nest there.
In the opinion of the nobles, it is sufficient to lay down old branches as a basis for birds to learn the nest and return to it.
Then the hypocrites will build their own dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskov district.
A new iron concrete pole was placed next to the electrocouple and placed on it a platform with an old, existing nest.
The whole operation cost 9000 graven energy.
And the other day, the same village took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrokov district at the front of Ani's grandmother.
This is where the platform was fixed in its original position, but it was lifted over the wires.
Ornitologists are confident that careful, conservative birds won't even notice in spring that their apartment was undergoing major repairs.
By the end of the year, four more nests in the Prush and Czaric districts of Dnipropetrovska are waiting for the same reconstruction.
By the way, while some of them save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
On the other hand, the entire area overcame the sad news - in the village of Ust Kamenka of the Apostolic region, on the day of the opening of the hunt for fazanes, the poachers shot a swan family living in the local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds weren't afraid of people - the locals fed them or offended them at all.
When the villagers heard the gunshots, they ran to the pond, and four of them were already lying dead on the water.
Now, the staff of the Apostolic Militia has found out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On November 4th, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be held in coordination with the Mayor of the Russian March.
According to the Levada Center survey, the support for the Russian marches is growing, with 40 per cent of citizens having different degrees of approval for the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada Center, 40 per cent of the citizens have different degrees of approval for "Russian marches": 11 per cent of these acts are clearly positive and 29 per cent are more positive.
The popularization of the Russian marches is gradually growing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed in 2006, and in December 2010, twice as many citizens (28 per cent) supported such activities.
"Definitely negative" for the Russian marches is only 7% Russian, 19% more negative.
Another 35% were unable to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, Moscow's mayor's office agreed to hold a Russian march of up to 15,000 people in Ljubljana, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majoorov.
This nationalist action has been taking place every year on People ' s Unity Day since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Have you heard that Russian marches are held on 4 November under the slogans of protecting Russian rights in Russia?" Three quarters (75%) of citizens responded negatively.
Now only one fifth of the Russians (20%) know about this stock.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost one third of citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the Russian marches.
We recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a spontaneous nationalist meeting took place in Manégo Square, which has become a riot.
Levada Center also asked Russians about the holiday that took place on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People ' s Unity Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens attend this holiday.
About the same (17%) will celebrate October Revolution Day on 7 November.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the mayor of Moscow, we agreed on the Russian March in Ljubljana.
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March on 4 November in Ljubljana.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the march of Dmitri Demushkin.
In addition to the Lublino march, a rally and a rock concert of the Colorrat Group will be held on the Day of People's Unity, also agreed upon with the authorities.
How was the "Rous March 2012"
On the Day of People ' s Unity in 2012, the Nationalists marched from the Jamaica Coast to the Central House of the painter where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants to be 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama ' s electoral headquarters considered the Bayden exception in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the immediate advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Byden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all of Mark Galperin and John Hailemann's expected 2012 campaign book, "Sawks Double: Game Changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the book preparing for the release and reported on Thursday evening that the incoming President's assistants had "large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether the Bayden exclusion could help raise the dying hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political examiner The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of attempts by high-ranking electoral headquarters officials and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Administration Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was secret, carefully guarded at Chicago electoral headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six immediate presidential advisers - including Daley, the former head of Obama's election headquarters, Jim Messin, and former senior advisers at the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff - knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book "Stucks Double" claims that Daley was the one who initiated an attempt to replace Baiden despite their close personal relationship, but eventually refused to do so when their data showed that Clinton's inclusion on the electoral list would not "enhanced Obama's substantial chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the Administration had indeed considered replacing Byden Clinton.
"I've been active in dealing with a lot of things, and it was one of them," said Daley the newspaper.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at that time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a "need test," Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the electoral headquarters had invested enough in examining whether that step would bring dividends to the vote.
"Prefabricated headquarters don't spend that amount of money on interviews and focus groups if they don't consider anything serious," said Martin in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his then boss about a possible transplant.
Although Daley said that he didn't think that the president was aware of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that Obama knew that "possibly" was.
Martin added that "The doubles" did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensing had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had not been aware of the study of the possibility of removing Baiden from the electoral list.
"Possibly," said Martin.
You want a lighter in the dark of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first bright, dark ice cream with a medal.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop light food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on nurses, and convinced scientists in China to recreate the glowing protein chemically.
Ice cream reacts to the language of the one who eats it, raising pH in the protein and making it shine.
Chris says that since ice cream starts glowing when it reacts to warm mouth, it means the more you lick, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lizzy me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning of production, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of the substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts to your language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the squirrel, it's gonna increase the pH level and the ice cream starts glowing.
We've tested him over the past few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce him to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful, glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because the meds are four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty nice.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of sauce gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's, by definition, impossible because of the breakup caused by ice crystals, which consist of ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
The Avangard Coach Vladimir Chabaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the regular KHL championship against Salavata, noted that the Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnetic Metallurga.
The specialist stressed that the Avangard needed to be given greater attention to the defence game.
We watched a video game against the Magnetic Metallurga, which is the official website "Avangard" of Chebaturkin's words.
- We missed a lot of pubs, not a very nice moment.
They missed their mistakes because of the failure of the game assignment.
We knew the rival had the perpetrators.
According to the statistics, they had five stroke attacks, three balloons hit us.
Very good implementation.
Those mistakes were taken into account in preparing for today's game?
Guys and I, we're gonna do a lot of research, talk after the game, get ready for a new rival.
It's important that the installation be carried out.
Everyone saw the first season of the match against Metalurga.
The game assignment was performed, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the goal "in the locker room" and started to make mistakes in the third period.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in connecting the defenders.
You have to defend the whole team.
Now the Avangard has a long home series, the matches are coming in the day, and the team's tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The key now is to realize their moments and perform the game assignment.
Hawkey is an emotional game, if you're doing the installation, it's not that complicated.
Because of the new regulations introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of vans have been in line for almost a week on the border with Russia.
Today, donetal officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotoites.
Hundreds of vans were buried at border points when entering Russia.
This situation has arisen because of a change in the rules for the Customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the turn creates a Russian party that did not warn about the innovations in advance.
Since 28 October, Russian customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, according to Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs.
The new model document applies in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Pass points are operating in an enhanced mode.
The "FACT" correspondent visited the border and spoke to the truckers who were hostage to the situation.
Prices in the road shop candy at the Novoazovsk pass point are rising every day, as is the turn from the van.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Newazovsk Customs Terminal - Vesselo-Voznesengka provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on an international highway.
From here the goods are sent to the Stavropol province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, and after the introduction of these rules, the traveler, Alexei Golovovov (in a photo), who transits through Russia the goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and a payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5,000 rubles (about 1,100 - 1,300 gryvens).
Those who go near (say, Georgia, Armenia) with up to $50,000 worth of cargo pay about 15,000 rubles (3800 gryven) and pass.
And the rest of them are stuck, because no one has that big money with them!
Can you imagine if the driver takes a shipment of only $4,000, but to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 grivens) to pay for transit?
The conditions for survival at the border - no, they're told by the drivers who eat by their cars.
Border shops and cafes are always expensive, but prices like this have never been met anywhere!
The sellers were focused and moved quickly: 15 gravin is worth a baton, seven graven is a cup of coffee, and 25 graven is a plate of soup.
And the cafeteria is alone.
And there's no toilet.
We're going to the bathroom.
Don't bathe or shave...
I can't leave the car for a week, my wife's on the road.
It's a week that's gonna last, and it's comforting to be another traveler, Victor Scotarenko.
Is it just gonna be a week's turn to my car?
Why do you have half a litre of vodka?
There's 11 and 15 grills.
What, is a bottle of crystal or is the water persistent on the silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take something while you have something else, the salesman's picking up.
Following media coverage, Ukrainian drivers drew attention to the plight of the region ' s authorities.
The leadership of the Ambroseevian and Novoazov Garden Administrations has been instructed to provide safe water to all those who are procrastinate on the Ukrainian-Russian border, and has declared the Acting President, Donetsk, to the leadership of Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are now on duty at the crossing points.
Biotoites will also be installed for the convenience of humans.
According to the official, the problem of custom will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of Donetsk, 32 and 68 vehicles had been closed as at 31 October, respectively, at the international crossing points of the Spunka and Novoazovsk.
"FACTS" will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and East Partnership countries - a statement made by the BNS agency in the State Security Department of the Republic (DGB).
This information has been published on the DELFI portal.
According to reports, in particular, Moscow is about to talk to the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauskait, and to publish the falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archivist, concerning the facts of the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the Department of Public Administration Analysis of the Russian President ' s Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is responsible for preparing an information attack.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania on several occasions and participated in the Lithuanian People ' s Party Congress.
A member of the operation is also alleged to be a member of the Department of V. Smirnov.
According to the Special Services, Smirnov had regularly visited Lithuania under the cover of scientific work by the end of 2012 and had contact with local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
On the eve of the day, President Gribauskait of Lithuania announced that he knew about the information that was being prepared for her.
In her view, Lithuania ' s successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and "the country ' s quest for energy independence" were the main reasons.
The Lithuanian leader had previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities more than once.
Thus, she stated that in the Kremlin Lithuania was "not sufficiently respectful."
In addition, Gribauskait accused the head of Vladimir Putin's Russian Federation of "one claim only" for Lithuania.
Remember, in September, Rosbrenadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products was not in line with health and epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare an appeal to WTO.
In the U.S., the principal of the school shelled teenagers.
The directors of one of the American secondary schools have literally brought the youth to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee State.
According to New York Post, the young bullies threw a man's house with toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries in the leg and a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not in the director ' s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail at $125,000.
We'll notice that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened a shooting at the center of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right outside.
After that, the criminal took two random passers hostage, hid them in the car's trunk and tried to escape.
Previously, a shooting was opened at Newtown Primary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late, and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a scrub.
I haven't been calling in the last two years to give away candy in my apartment, and I'm probably not gonna be here this year.
But statistics show that I'm a white crow for Halloween.
According to the National Retails Federation, most Americans - 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is practice.
The National Retails Federation predicts that the costume will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion, sexy uninvited objects.
Women are no longer required to be sex workers; they may also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I think we'll see a lot of zombies because of "We're walking the dead," and I'm sure that the Daft Punk-style cosmonauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that most often look for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retails Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on domestic animal costumes.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't miss it.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, glaciers, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers gum candy and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is a great news for 41 million children requiring candy who are prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we're gonna buy and - we're not gonna cheat ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn grains; yet, according to the National Association of Condiers, nearly 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I still have to figure out.
Nothing says Halloween as much as haunted houses.
They have amazing names, such as "Bears behind the walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Voy and screaming" and "The House of shock."
Moreover, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing pictures where you almost described your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't clean up, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "class expression of face."
And in conclusion, we'll talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tuck when we were kids, and cutting Jack's lamp is like a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, the baby's fashion in the pumpkin only started last year thanks to the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million this year on pumpkin.
Jack's lighter, slowly drying up on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more difficult tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa State of California and try to cut anything out of their pumpkin at a cost of £032.
Estonia's Ministry of Defence site recovered after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defence has been re-established following the morning cyber attacks and reports to the press service of the agency.
According to the Vice Chancellor of the Ministry of Defence for Information and Administration, Timemar Petercopa, this was a primitive attack, and the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set things up, so far the site has been re-established.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petercop of Postimees.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who organized the attack.
"We will certainly examine the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
Nagori, on 1 November, Anonymous Ukraine posted a message on the network confirming the hacking attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposing the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"The hands are away from Ukraine," stated in Anonymous' statement.
Previously, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marines of Feodosia, a separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps, would participate in the NATO Steadfast Jazz 2013 command-level exercises.
Due to the riot, the unclean force had to close several schools and the hospital.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of Southern Mathebelland had to be closed because the students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder told, children were panicked and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument to close the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, Zimbabwe closed the hospital because the medical staff also attacked the goblins.
Called for the Land Rover race series
There are racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as an internal communications system.
In addition, updated brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between activities can be obtained.
Drew Bauler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The members of the rally who turn to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people seeking excitement, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and believe that this format offers a new way to try the different disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the harsh conditions and realities of the rally-fish.
It's gonna be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian silos don't know anything about the group "Brat Circle" - New News
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source within the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports of the U.S. Department of Finance Leps being placed on control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'Brat Circle' have appeared in the media, we have reviewed all databases, but no such group has been identified," the agency's interviewer said.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called Russian mafia that allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written by N.N., yesterday the U.S. Department of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the Brat Circle criminal group.
The Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named among them.
He's on the list as Grisha, put it on the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian singer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five others mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR whose nationality is not specified.
In the U.S., it is certain that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was carrying money for the bandits at their order.
This report is accompanied by a photograph of the singer and indicates all of his data that are true.
Moreover, Leps actually bought a house recently on Phuket.
The agency noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The placing of a person on the black lists of the United States Minfin entails freezing its assets in the United States and banning business contacts with persons living in the United States.
Leps Maya Serikova's assistant stated that there was no notification to the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's Grigory, who everyone is talking about right now in connection with the US scandal."
All Leps knows is media records.
He had not been formally notified in person, although he did not know whether they were available in such cases.
"And of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other, amazing and unexpected," she said, "RIA News.
According to her, Gregory Leps doesn't live on Phukete, but according to the United States Department of Finance, he does have a house on Thai Island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour on the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during his flight to the city of Blessensk.
He ran out on the field at the Shinnik match.
Some details of the identity of the fan who fled the field during the match 1/16 of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartacom" came to light.
As stated by the head of the FRC, Arthur Grigorianc, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this cheerleader is a Moskwich.
He's in custody right now.
"In addition to this Grigoriantz, he explained how the fan had been able to break into the field: "It has come to light that this one, we call him a viewer, went to an ambulance accompanied by two viewers, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, confirmed by an ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed away two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South rostrum to the corner of the East and North rostrum.
He ran through the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Before the Sports Act comes into force, it's an action zone for the stewards - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He got to the rostrum, climbed through the East rostrum.
And at that time the riots began on the East rostrum and on the runways," the head of the KDC said.
We recall that the Moscow Spartacus decision of the KDC will hold the upcoming 15th tour of the Russian Championship against Lockomotowa and Zenita, and will also pay a fine of 600,000 roubles.

Ruby's cocker puncture ran away after she got into a small accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a career and noticed a man walking a dog.
Firefighters came down on the rope on the back slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The snitch managed to escape after the fire brigades were called to lift him up and get him to a safe place after he somehow got stuck at 50 feet high on the dangerous side of the curtain slope.
Ruby's nine-month puncture cocker ran away after she got into a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from a career on Wednesday.
Her hostess, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend, Becky Hall, were at the career of Flappitit in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were looking for their missing dog and making calls on social media websites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 p.m. on Wednesday, Ruby saw a slick dog driver stuck at 50 feet high on the quarry.
The technical rescue unit from Clecchiton fire station rushed to the scene, went down the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transport to lift her up the slope.

It was right in the middle of the curtain slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move and the muscle during the rescue, and she's completely cold.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
The rescue officer, Peter Lowe, said, "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
It was likely that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for inspection, and it was found to be all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "It was scary to watch the rescue."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
Veterinary said that if she was dehydrated and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters were great.
It was very brave - what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
Firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a Baek vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old habitats die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a rocker, and he said, "He was playing with me when I was 18."
She said, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of a 70-year-old Jagger said that he "believes categorically that he has ever given up for Katie Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the artists who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: The gap with Europe gives Scottish choice
One more day, one more scary about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrianov's val.
True, Strathclyde highlighted the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although, predictablely, it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone indicated that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as they are comfortable with it.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels in lieu of what he really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's not a worthy story.
And so old that she turned into fossilism, for the first time I heard a duck saying "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost in the old story.
Why does an independent Scotland even have to obey Europe's orders?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels, especially now?
The real European news is that the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrysis, Europa's project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the elimination of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the "Alternative for Germany" party, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing out "Free Democrats" (analogue of our Liberal Democratics) from Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to a federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to think that the Europa project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national Governments are working with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the euro system blocked its members for exchange rates beneficial to German exporters - that German politicians wanted to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is in a pre-disadvantaged position on productive opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are facing a deeper challenge to Europe ' s productive capacity.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
It's paralysingly unfavourable price conditions, as we've seen in Granjmut.
No freeze in the world's wages will stop the collapse of the US's cheap slender gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a riot, especially in France, once the very brightest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way to control Germany and place Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destroyed economy of France in distress.
The result is the right anti-EU Marin Le Pen party, the National Front, has just won decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling socialist party to third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes - a timely warning to British librarians that it cannot be assumed that division among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If - and this is very likely - the parties against the EU receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: Soon, growing sentiments against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will unite to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become some sort of vague "Europe (Sovereign) Nations" that liked General de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project, hoping to get close to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific reveals that Britain is likely to remain unattended in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does Scotland leave it?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland can succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party ' s Government in Scotland is, strangely, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which obtained an impressive majority of votes in 2011, owing to objections to cost reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alister Darling, and subsequently formed by the Tori and Liberal Democratic Coalition.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only to take austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: early ageing
Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic can be one of the early puberty trigger mechanisms
The trend towards early sexual maturity is less pronounced among boys
Former correspondent CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should mothers be scared if their daughters begin to develop breast gloves and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time comforting my parents - usually it doesn't mean a rapid onset of total sexual maturity," said Kaplovitz.
There are obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, frontal hair, and rinse hair, and the smell of the body, before girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and fell from 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two or three years to the manarche," said Kaplovitz, who also wrote the book "Amenier puberty for girls: how to deal with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes a de facto sexual maturity, but it is considered "preliminary" when the increase in breasts is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to eight years of growth.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - that the pediatrician can monitor carefully.
Faster progress could be the basis for endocrinologist analysis to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature ageing of bones, which may ultimately lead to slow growth and low growth in mature age.
The recommendations on medication or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Mental aspects are also important.
The Kaplovitz is careful with the drugs, but acknowledges that "addication of puberty can mitigate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers."
Another big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they can handle hygiene," said Kaplovitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter of menstruation started at 10 years old.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many known theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are guilty of milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, have sexual maturity before.
Kaplovitz claims that the prelude, which has the greatest weight, is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links the amount of fat in the body to the age of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls tended to reach puberty before their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Throughout the world, early puberty is likely to be affected by all, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery is that while boys have hair on their face and on their forehead at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of dusty and pubic hair even occurs in infants and young children of Yasel age.
"We must be careful about how we determine the true sexual maturity," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Horeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from the paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean earlier than expected conversation," explained Caplovitz.
If you stay calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who thrive early need proof that even when this happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing for the flight.
The open sky Treaty observation flights over Russian territory and the United States aircraft landing on Wednesday in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8.30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbour.
The airport authorities allowed the flight on board to receive the fuel money.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Ude.
According to other data, he's going to the United States.
It was reported that the aircraft flying to Ulaanbaatar landed in the Zabaykal province because of the fog.
He was not released from Chita airport due to unpaid accounts.
There are 30 persons on board, including the crew, two nights at the airport, reporting to ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, according to the terms of the Open Nuba Treaty, people on board an aircraft are not entitled to leave Chita airport, but only two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulaanbaatar - Ude - can pass border controls.
The Open Nuba Treaty was signed in 1992 and is attended by 34 States.
Surveillance flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate monitoring of arms control agreements, enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capacities within OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities earn - the ICJ in the United States?
The largest living celebrities in 2013 were led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
The other celebrities who lost their lives last year, "worked" a few times less, lags behind him.
The second one on the list of the most "celebrity" celebrities of the Year's Forbes magazine was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the next line was the author of Peanuts Charles Schultz comics with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million), and Bob Marley's musician (18 million), were included in the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein also appeared on the list.
In Moscow, Igor Gulyaev's first buoyant opened.
On 23 October, Igor Gulaev's first flagship buoy in Moscow was opened.
It is known to the general public as Igor Ghoulev's mechanics.
And now they're gonna be able to appreciate more fashion fans - in Moscow, his first boutique finally opened up, which is why the designer had a dolce vita party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's what Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted... to try the models he looked at!
Reactivated aircraft manufacturers are fighting over the width of the seat when large orders are at stake
There was a fierce debate among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-range flights, creating a tone for violent confrontation at the Dubai air exhibit this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-distance flights to passengers of the economic class whose interests are not always the focus of the airline, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the assertions of the effectiveness of the last aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a industry standard that would provide for the width of the seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic-class salons, but its main American rival Boeing says that this should be decided by the airline.
The dispute goes on at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sales of increasingly large versions of their two-motor long-range fixed-wing aircraft, and a potentially record order is expected at the 17-21 November event.
The back-up of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 persons are on board - is at the centre of the statements on the cost-effectiveness of the new "mini-aerobus" projects.
Boeing states that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 persons, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will be carried in the economic class of 350 people in seats with a width of 18 inches, 9 in row.
Aircraft giants often exchange technical strikes by advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is approaching the public directly before the Dubai air show, where 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how the start of a new commercial war could be, showing financialists a slide that depicts three people in a restaurant that's drawn to one another, called "Would you agree to it?"
"Boeing offers long-distance flights in seats more narrow than regional turbine aircraft," said the sales manager, Airbus John Liha.
With a change in diet, people collect weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when a large-scale Boeing 747 set standards for modern far-reaching travels, and the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The 21st century average American man's waist is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that her rival adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s when the average Taliban grabbed those recently called "reactive public" was already.
Airbus says that she commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus' size figures and says that producers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, research shows that the ease of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
"Everything is actually about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to succeed," said the Boeing specialist at Kent Craver's salon.
They don't want us to decide for them what's gonna make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase space by side, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
This argument is followed by a race for orders for aircraft valued at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuter stated for the first time in July, the location of seats is exactly what fuels competition in the battle between the latest jet planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability per place in their last two-motor driving models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are based in part on the comparison of the 10-local rows 777X with the original 9-local set of constructive decision 777.
The gains in unit costs are reduced compared to the 10-bed composition currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to hang more seats and make his plane more competitive than our development," said Kevin Keniston, the head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-bed lounges for the 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"The 18 inches wide would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is due to the threat from the 777th model," said the interior specialist of Mary Kirby's salon, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide salesmen of jet planes will even take their rolls to check competing designs.
By praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense layout of the airfare and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the need for additional modifications to the salon, offering more space at the entrance to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other producer of large modern aircraft, experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "fly" but may divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive cigarette smoking of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before people are tested, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Whale Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to drop by testing all the methods available in the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infected the liver cells, which then started producing a stable antibodies stream.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a nicotine smoker from getting a nicotine impact.
In the tests, vaccined mice, which was subsequently given by nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that weren't given the vaccine were "dismissed," and that's a sign that nicotine got to their brains, says researchers,
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, the injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and non-precious.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Christall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette by preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Olaynikov: one third of the village settlements of Podmoskowya are fully subsidized
Lieutenant-Governor of Podmoskovia Yuri Olaynikov stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were fully subsidized.
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 are receiving grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of grants in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent in the grant rate.
As part of the budget allocation from the regional budget, some 25 billion rubles are coming from the regional budget, " said Olaynikov.
The Deputy Governor also noted that there were only three urban settlements - Mittishk, Lotsuno and Pushkino - which accounted for more than 1 billion roubles in 2013.
Rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million rubles, "it's not enough."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 sub-moskovia settlements is over 70 per cent, "and the quality of services has been reduced," noted by Olaynikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Podmoskovia to consider which settlements needed to be consolidated, merged into city districts or changed administrative administration by the end of November.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of Moscow stated that the administrative reform in Podmoskovje planned to reduce the number of rural settlements.
Also in Mojaya, Kashire, Solnegorsk, Colombo, Luberca and Kotelnik, there is a request for the consolidation of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue will begin in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The President of Mosibledum Igor Brynzlov also stated that the entire integration of the upcoming admreforms was planning some 30 rural settlements in 12 Podmoskovia districts.
This is linked to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Podmoskowje, less than one third have a "acceptable" financial base and 100 are subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diane Arbenin doesn't hide the great pleasure she gets from her children's upbringing.
Although it is now Arbenin that it is especially time for creativity and social activity, it still finds it possible to deal with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their education, but also entertaining as much as it can.
In the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her teaching talents.
First she put a picture on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And last night, I beat the fans by showing Artem and Martha up for Halloween.
For the raccoons, they're ready! Our first halfwayen" called Diane a picture of her children in the party costumes.
What is not wise is that they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have anything to do with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "undefined sex" in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate "undefined" in the registration of children born to hermophrodites instead of males or females.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the sex box in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (women's sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can write "X" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at preventing parents from rushing into a "clearing" gender operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born as a hermaphrodite.
Tridoni denies that he is influenced by Obaid.
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tridoni, will be a figure in the investigation of the anti-corruption oversight body of this state.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tridori, refutes the change in the rental of the maritime facilities at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who secretly held shares in the three properties on State land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease to Serquilar Ki, where the family of Obaida belonged to two restaurants and cafes, without passing the tender after the expiration of their term in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s secret participation in real estate facilities after the testimony given by Mr. Tridoni Lynn Ashpool, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
In the course of several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that rents should be placed in open competition.
The tenants were against this and wanted longer lease periods.
In 2009, the contracts for the rental of enterprises at Serquilar Kee, which brought about US$2.5 million per year to the family of Obaida, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at Mr. Obaid ' s request, who, as Mr. Tridori had acknowledged, urged changes in the Government ' s rental policy.
The ICAC ' s telephone decryptation was given in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tridoni and Steve Tunm, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obaid ' s leadership in the Fisheries Division.
"Did the question discussed during these telephone conversations be the development of a commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tridoni.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior management official interviewed Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes attacked targets in the Syrian port town of Latakia on Thursday evening.
Chinovnik didn't say it was for the purpose, but he said that at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried air strikes on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of Division 457 may be tested for "subliminity"
The "subsistence" test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to expand repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The Government ' s discussion paper was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McCew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia ' s neighbours.
"Langerous statements of the type "foreigners at the end of the line" and "early Australians" represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market," she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw the oscillations of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The paper presented for discussion contains 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under consideration.
If the criteria of "subsequence" are adopted, the applicant may be examined for a visa to "be genuine in the circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close friend of the owner or person involved in the financing of the enterprise."
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of visa holders of Division 457, as businesses that had previously intended to sponsor a small number of employees then took hundreds of jobs.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man, who was killed in grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who has also been on board the ship.
The Australian authorities sent a man to Christmas Island Hospital in a hurry, where he died.
Semen Varlamova's friend stated that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism.
A friend of the hockey player, Semena Varlamov Eugenia Vavrinuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism, handed over to the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, inter alia, a woman.
We recall that Waurinuk filed a trial for beating the Russian rocker Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her behind her hair and also beat her - after the attack, her hands, breasts, stomachs and necks were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict athletes to travel across the country, but prohibited approaching Vavrinuk.
He is also facing imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
Project HS2 involves the opening of a high-speed message with Scotland and North England, with the beginning of Phase I in 2026
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project "will connect Britain."
Scotland's Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said that he was "happy" of the prospect of working on the plan with the British Government.
The first step will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase II is completed, the lines will be located in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of constructing a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improving railway capacity and reducing travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of overcoming the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal of HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the transport of cities to each other; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive a better message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alister Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Tory is the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy costs the same, but leaves a lot of money behind in waste management.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to the thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeeve system.
It is found around the world and, according to specialists, it is not waste that should be stored for centuries.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their plans and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the US to mitigate the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remain in the Air Force.
Passengers may already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are irritating that they do not have access to their electronic books during the take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to perform a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
In the Civil Aviation Safety Office, they also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight still existed in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in fixed-wing aircraft," it stated.
The issue is governed by regulations requiring air carriers to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the change, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
"We would welcome a review by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of the resolution of the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the combat wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," the press secretary said.
Qantas stated that he would adhere to the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon," she said.
The FAU Regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study closely the decision of the FAU and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the effect of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airline.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio traffic from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, manual storage standards and passenger instructions.
"After the airline checks and confirms the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height," FAU stated.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be placed under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan hears a note of extremism in the Anthem of Kubani.
The football match between Anji and Cubaniu was drawn into a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Anthem of Kubani sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday, invited Republican parliamentarians to appear before the courts because the Anthem of the Krasnodar province allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, inter alia, calls for war with the Basourmans.
Take the Anthem of the Krasnodar province, this was confirmed in 1995 by the Anthem.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"You're here to remember, like your mother, your enemy, we're going to the death fight," for which the words are recorded in the anthem, to poison some of the believers on the other believers," expressed solidarity with the Abdulatype Chairman of Parliament, Hizri Shihsaids.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news from the ocean, namely, Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel has attacked Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Syria has now fulfilled an important condition of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia, which allowed the US not to carry out the military operation to which they had come in earnest this summer.
More detailed about the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President, will tell our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August of poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had destroyed the declared chemical factories.
The longer-term and difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand it's about 1,000 tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it happens.
He's no longer a Legitimist, and he has to leave.
But Asad stays.
And it feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalms.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has escaped the punishment of mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is referred to as the success of diplomacy, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to inspectors, and Asad himself gave the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be more likely to be killed by chemical weapons.
Asad's still holding up.
And changes the weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and ZKH.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, created a new Ministry responsible for construction and ZKH and offered to lead his ex-Governor of the Ivan region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met Michael Mene at the New Ogarevo residence, and Men did not refuse to lead the new department.
The Press Secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, explained that all the functions relating to construction and the ZKH were being transferred to a new Ministry from the Minregion.
Mikhail Meen is the son of the famous Orthodox priest, Protoyer of Alexander Me, and graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Sciences of Gobkin.
His political career began in 1995 and he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergievo-Posad region and was a member of the State Duma, the First Vice-Premier of the Moscow Government and Vice-Premier of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Meen was governor of the Ivan region.
Pawbard owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is struggling.
In a lobard at the Bendemir shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthhaling is setting up a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there," said Ms. Amirthhaling.
Although she earns S$3000 (2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not sufficient, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is increasing - is that ValueMax, where it holds a deal, became the third lobster registered on Singapore's stock exchange this week.
Loans to jewellery are not just a quick way to get money (S$300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhaling), but also almost as cheap as unsatisfied bank loans.
Singapore's lobsters usually pay an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent - slightly above 15.4 per cent proposed at the United Overseas Bank office, a local creditor with a branch at the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require creditworthiness or proof of wages and can provide loans faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are being pushed into pawnshops because families feel pressured by higher living costs and rapid increases in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and low-cost loans fuelled by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families resort to pawnshops to compensate for lower incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list from 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The fact that, with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income tables] will seek ways to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Woon, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The record of high gold prices over the past two years has increased the speed with which people make their personal belongings because they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items laid at 200 pawns of the city-state are gold products.
People say, "It looks good on gold, let's put a gold chain on Grandma and get it back next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest pawn operator observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the pawn business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir office and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director ValueMax.
The company will fund expansion using 60 per cent of the S$66 million seized this week as a result of the stocking of Singapore ' s stock exchange.
While some creditors had given rise to criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the pawnbard was not only offering cheaper tariffs than other creditors, nor did it increase debt directly.
"The clients are laying the items they already own and the monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increased public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And not only are the categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation used by the pawnshops.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, laying gold bars or Rolex watches, which can provide up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy persons who need to borrow money for a short period of time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to be overcome by temporary financial difficulties," said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, the quality of health care is important to the population, not to the number of available health facilities and their status.
The implementation of the "Modernization of Health Care in the Tuland Region 2011-2013" programme, the reorganization of our city's medical facilities, will provide an optimal framework for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and women.
For example, after integration with the throat, there has been an even greater opportunity to attract specialized specialists from the NGBS to consult pregnant women with different pathologies, and to carry out additional examinations at the hospital base.
During the implementation of the modernization programme, the physical and technical infrastructure of the maternity home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment has emerged to meet world standards.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance, and 112 items of equipment have been purchased totalling 42 million roubles.
The most up-to-date equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The caesarean section uses the Sell-Saver machine to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return her to the birthplace, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory diagnostic clinic.
The women ' s consultation has an electronic registry, and the introduction of electronic maps and stories of patients ' illness is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial assault on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasus.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes at a Strasburg hotel and then beaten and robbed them.
The gang leader was the 27-year-olds of the previous Cichini-prosecuted harvester.
The Bavaria Protector David Alaba became Austria's best athletes in 2013, reporting to the official Bundeslige website.
In this dispute, he was ahead of winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was Marseille Hirsher, and the third was a ski jump from Gregor Schlirenzauer's tramp.
Last season, a 21-year-old Australian of Filipino-Nigeria origin helped his team win the Champions League, the Championships and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov.
The former civilian wife of the singer of Zeneta, Andrei Arshavin Julia Baranovsky, spends her vacation with actor Andrea Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy at the company of the actress Anastasia Zaroadya, her fiancé, the figure of Sergei Slavovov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Images from the joint walk of couples were published in Instagram Anastasia, Zadaya.
This isn't the first joint picture of Andrew and Julia.
On 5 October, the SUV published a picture on which a couple were hugging on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the Havbek Zeneta, Andrei Arshavin, admitted to living separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovsky and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, and they have three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is meeting with Alice Kazmina's ex-model.
Arshavin's new friend was married to a corporate top manager.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania health care
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the weakened health care system in Tasmania will be supplemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the state government will not spend any money.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Commonwealth was taking "urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, the higher level of chronic disease and the limitations of the system.
A four-year funding decision was made following consultations by the Government with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilky.
"The Government has offered a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said today Ms. Plibersec.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
There is also money for non-prescription clinics in Hobart and Loneston to improve the quality of post-patient care, to train health professionals, mental health services and to introduce personal e-health card systems in local hospitals.
"These investments will go to the best doctors' ideas about how best to help the Tasmania health system," said Ms. Plibersec.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and responsibility.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilky said today that $325 million would not decide "if they were not followed by a genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis."
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state's health system from critical conditions," said Mr. Wilky.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures largely offset recent reductions.
But the federal opposition representative for health care, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is "a solution similar to a leacoplasty."
"The reason we're here is that the Labour Government has emptied $430 million from the health system," he said by ABC TV.
When the state government rents nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that it is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersec to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Giyom Nickla's ecrantification of Danny Didro's novel may be taken over by an exceptional design and historical detail, but it's also harder to see than it should have been.
The film that takes place in France in the 1760s tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocratka sent to his family's monastery.
When she starts to riot, she has extreme cruelty at the hands of a resident sadist and becomes the object of erotic fantasy for others.
The film never drops down to plaster or sensation, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test like a vulture and an audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing tools, says the Monitoring Group
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisoned gas, declared on Thursday an international monitoring group, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by the organization based in The Hague to ensure that Damascus destroys or "disabled" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms that allow the mixing of chemicals with the acquisition of a toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially an initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the violent fighting on Thursday in Safira City, where experts believe that the chemical weapons production facility, as well as its storage site, is located, reports to the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored casualties through a network of activists in Syria said that 120,296 people had died on Thursday.
Of this number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government ' s side, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among those killed, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Asada's troops fought rebels in Safir for several weeks, many of them associated with al-Qa'idah groups.
The Centre stated that there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The Boi highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who were caught up in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was "now satisfied that it verified and saw all critical production and mixing/refuel equipment declared by Syria destroyed."
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, and the inspectors stated.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both places were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... items of the chemical weapons programme in them have been relocated to other declared sites that have been verified."
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safir was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumju Monitoring Group said in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are composed of members of his Alavites sect, the retaliatory of Shi'i Islam.
With regard to other developments, Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the centre, said that there had been a severe environmental explosion at the PSB site in the coastal province of Syria, Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
The anger caused by the conviction of the organizers of the Bali attack
The remaining 202 survivors and relatives of the Bali bombing in 2002 responded with anger to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been brought before the courts and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he receives parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kut, during which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including a wave of bombings by churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called "a bomber" for his reputation as a bomb master should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of her mother from Pert June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
She said that Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the splinter team, said Ms. Cortin AAP.
- I have to live every day, knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren, and I will not see my daughters."
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in a parked van was launched immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he was in a coma and a "miral" three times a month, being connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the three other members of the terrorist cell "Jemaa Islamiya" responsible for the bloody massacre - Amrozi, Muhlas and Imam Sastela, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after you killed 202 people and injured hundreds isn't that much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the Bali attack to be brought before the courts.
He's been hiding for almost a decade, but he was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where United States troops killed the former leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that intelligence data showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore links between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets as to how much grief he had caused to other people.
The sentence is pending the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAFO: "The air passengers are now able to use the gadgets on fixed-wing aircraft (but do not call from the mobile phone) "
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Authority.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented will vary depending on the airline, and the FAU administrator, Michael Weert, said at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and the rules for fitting devices in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of laptop electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
" Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of electronic devices very soon," stated by the FAU.
Currently, passengers are required to shut off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They shouldn't restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives us a "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is reduced for landing and not include them until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and run-off have declared to the FAU.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Trainers, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy is implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve it), it will be a win-win option," said Glading.
We're clearly tired of being "school-dead" when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connections for surfing, e-mail exchanges, text messages or data downloads will still be banned at less than 10,000 feet, and the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, planters and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there are still no "Sloves with Friends" - an intellectual Internet game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on its way to landing.
And the heavier devices, like laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage compartment because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the salon.
Cell phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Safety Council, National Transport Security Expert CBS News, stated that cell phones continued to be considered a risk.
"The cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can interfere with the cell tower when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee, established by the FAU to study this issue, recommended last month that the Government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAU to ease restrictions on their use.
Criticists, such as the Democratic Senator from Missouri Claire McCaskill, claim that there are no compelling security reasons for the prohibitions.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigational and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech gagees of that time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
Air companies have been offering the passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the planes are adapted for the wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Weert.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, emit only minimal signals when rewrite pages.
But the signals become stronger when the devices download or send the data.
Among those who sought to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company ' s representatives loaded a whole airliner with their tools to read Kindle ' s e-books and flew to check the problem, but never found them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices represented any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association stated that he considered interference with devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only separate pilot messages confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to shut down the devices during the installation of the devices in reduced visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step towards passengers who now use many technological devices.
"We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Doe, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Trainers will be able to pass driving licence examinations
Driving licence examinations will be available for private companies with their own computerized vehicle.
This is written by the Commersant, referring to the draft Government Regulation "On admission to driving."
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motor vehicles in Russia.
It is expected that the students of these "privileged" autoschools will calculate the results of the internal testing.
In doing so, the State Office will monitor the examination every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical examinations and more than 20 per cent of the school ' s courses are not passed on from the first time, such a school will be denied six months ' privileges.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft Government Regulation will enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for the training of two-wheeled equipment.
Since 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass the test in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to employ foreigners with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian rights after the examination.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea was released back into wild nature
The bird that was transported by air to the shore after being found depleted on the oil tower in the North Sea was released back into wild nature.
This waterpaste was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month, and then released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
The manager of Colin Ceddon Center said, "This waterpaste is likely to be a winter migrant from Northern Europe, who has fallen into a strong wind zone over the North Sea."
Looks like the bird was crazy and able to find refuge on the oil tower.
He said, "She was unable to take off again, so she asked us for help."
The waterpaste was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes British wealth and employment creators want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are at a standstill.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming EU confused institutions.
When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from competition to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with a single market, with business representatives stating that the costs of regulation from Brussels were now outweighing the benefits of being located in the European trade zone - even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most European of all companies agreed to do so.
Last and most notable, our survey of business managers has revealed that the obvious majority wants Britain to pursue a course to change the contract and to work with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will restore authority back to Britain.
The stakes are high - achieving changes in the contract and more favourable conditions for Britain will result in a 16 per cent shift in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to review the terms of British membership in the EU.
He also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a closer economic and financial association.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain and, as our survey shows, for business, this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s normative activities.
U.S. Special Services listening to Pope's personal phone
The Vatican ' s activities are under the vigilant control of American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that the U.S. intelligence was auditioning all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now he's in close custody of Pope Francis.
His phone started listening before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new dad was also under observation.
What the US has attached particular importance to.
The Special Service connected to the cell phones of the Cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The cell phones of the residence where the members of the conclave lived were also heard.
American spies have listened to all major applicants to the papal throne to prevent Washington's undesirable figure from appearing on it.
Panorama magazine states that the U.S. "big ear" continued to intercept prelate conversations until the end of the 12 March conclave.
It is alleged that in the United States, since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been designated as the future Pope of Rome.
The American Intelligence has also been following negotiations related to the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine states that the United States Embassy continues to operate a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives, producing information on policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has made a solemn announcement that he does not care about the American "smart," even if it is happening.
From US leadership, holy fathers have no secrets.
Snobordist for the Olympics was photographed on purpose.
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
It's 100 rubles.
But on the network, bloggers are already actively ironic about the aide-memoire.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Buyer on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that a picture of the notebook from the banknotes could be found in the photobanks.
In particular, in a free-of-charge stockExchange, where this photograph was dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megaobsor" on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the RugGear smartphone commercial.
The Olympic banknote was executed in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snobordist flying over Sochi, on the other hand, is a species of Olympic stadium and Zhar Pitz.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Boucouyev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports had been considered - mining, fristile and tram jumping - but eventually had chosen a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the news source close to the CB, the regulator cares about the public ' s perception of the wide dissemination of the snobordist image with the Olympic banknote and is currently studying the situation.
But in Gonznak, it's not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State Intelligence Service, Natalia Nikiforov, said to the news that all the reasoning about the plagiat was ridiculous.
The snoubordist on the banknote will turn right, in the photos on the network left, clarified Nikiforov.
The man on the photo shoots to make the suit was taken from different points, then the final image was selected, and it was characteristic of the snowboard.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic Bank because the artist had been paid for work.
According to the experts, the debate about the image in the Olympic bath and was positive.
An understanding of the image on the coupon - plus for its promotion - is considered by the Executive Director of the NP, RusBrand, Alexei Popovichev.
It is difficult to prove 100 per cent similarities between the images on the coupon and in the photobanks, so it is unlikely that intellectual property claims will be made against the image.
The Olympic Bank first appeared in China, where a commemorative banknote was released in 10 Yuan in Beijing in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer.
Russian beers have a bad mood.
They're guessing that the country's beer consumption next year will remain at the same level, and that's at best.
Although businessmen were initially counting on growth.
The current year is not good for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the country's largest brewery companies, the President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beers, Isaac Sheps, at the third annual conference of Adam Smith's Institute of Daily Demand in Russia, just concluded in Moscow.
It discussed government regulation of the market.
Between 2008 and 2012, the Russian beer market had already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry with regard to the production and trafficking of beer, a drink with a low alcohol content, reporting to Sheps.
In no country in the world is there such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new illogical prohibitions that justify the alleged abuse of alcohol.
The brewery reported that many legislative prohibitions aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a particular impact, but that new initiatives were constantly emerging.
More painfully, the beer was hit by the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks since this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
There's two prognosis for beers next year.
Optimistic is what Sheps was talking about: the sale of foam drinks will continue at the same level.
Pessimistic is going to fall by 2 to 3 per cent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from classes designed for the mass consumer to the "premium" class: the beer will be smaller, but it will cost more.
However, the radical consequences of the decline in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"In my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at the same level, " reported a drug doctor, Alexei Sotnikov.
True, there was an increase in the proportion of patients who used hard drink surrogates, as well as those who were "subsidized" on alcoholic tonic beverages like Jaguar, while 10 years ago it was just "pine" alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford car factory in Allwojsk.
As they say in the unions, all the dismissed were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is more acute than that of workers.
The deputy of the regional Zach Sah Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that some 600 people had been cut down at the Ford factory in All-Wollock.
According to him, this occurred in September, when some 600 people left the factory under the voluntary separation programme, which was developed with the union of the organization.
A number of salaries were offered to workers who had decided to resign themselves.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs on their own will.
Yet, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think this is gonna stop.
In the next two years, however, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programmes to support regional enterprises in difficult situations," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large drop in employment.
In Ford, this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're gonna publish it.
Talking about the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in All-Wollock is going on a long time ago.
For example, the company ' s plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Previously, the factory announced a suspension of the car production.
The fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia was cited as a reason for the factory.
According to Petrostat, the production of industrial production in Lenobasti fell by 5.4 per cent as a result of nine months of 2013.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during the take-off and landing of the aircraft.
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the aircraft were approved in the United States and broadcast by BBC.
United States airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the voyage, and the new regulations will be operational by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connections for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Owing to the risk of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be prohibited.
Airfare passengers will thus be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, according to the United States, the existing standards of use of electronic devices in flights may also be revised in Britain.
For the Russian Mafia in the United States, the new name "Brat Circle" was finally established.
This week, the black list of Russian Mafia in America was added to the new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance has incorporated three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli into the Brat Circle.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who the U.S. is suspected of transporting money to the members of the group.
A total of 22 individuals involved in the "Brother Circle" and six affiliated organizations are on the U.S. black list.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization exists.
"The declaration of the "Brother Circle" is more about trying to unite divided criminal groups," previously stated by the expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotti University of New York.
In his view, the "Brat Circle" reflects the popular perception of "Russian Mafia."
"I haven't met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or elsewhere who would have confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization," quoted Mr. Galeotti as the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelley University.
"If they work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Centre for the Research of Corruption and Organized Crime refers to it.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that "Brother Circle" brings together more Russian thieves in the Aslan Usoyan Act, known as Ded Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zachariah Kalashova, who completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Ded Hassan, while another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti pointed out that some individuals had nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were more united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which led to such a decision as to why he had been placed on such lists, said the press secretary of the Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a Russian citizen.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field.
The construction of the Southern Flow gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, as stated by the Head of Gazprom.
"Today there was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Flow is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia ' s gas destined for Europe is located, increases the risk to normal routes, is said by officials.
Miller stated that the direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the "Southstream" at low prices once the entire project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees were charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission had learned.
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were filed in 2011 against a child-care worker in Caringbach, Jonathan Lord, and the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children was informed.
But the commission's opening statement stated that "never had any cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization."
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Hare, was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a sports instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second case.
He acknowledged that YMCA had also made it inaccurate in its introductory speech to the Commission, claiming that "there had been external inspections of YMCA that acknowledged that YMCA was at the forefront of child safety."
The evidence provided to the commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it received the second possible quality audit evaluations from the end of the four possible evaluations carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hair, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower leadership had missed the Lord's hiring and had not been able to ensure a clear understanding among staff of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years of work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that the YMCA corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting child security violations to Lord.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, looked after them personally, kneeled them to his knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked to teach her to protect children because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of the YMCA office in Karingbach, who was Lord's head, "very scary and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept staff explanations that it was embarrassing to report the situation to his superiors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with Lord prevented them from thinking about the need to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had presented his view to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from "the incident with Jonathan Lord" was not "relating to the provision of information" by staff members, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the charges had been issued had been made by the Director General of YMCA for the custody of children, Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the breaking of evidence, but it was "remediated" and the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during its work in Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, and informed the Commission by Professor Stephen Smallbon of Griffith University, an expert on child molestation.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, selection, guidance, training and monitoring.
The hearing is postponed until December 20th.
São Paulo fashion week.
It's not just a dummies in the country, it's a real star.
Even though Giselle Bündchen left her job for a while, get distracted by motherhood, on these days and this week she arrived on purpose.
A month of absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she was part of the Colchci defiel.
The final of fashion weeks is usually the most interesting display.
Sort of what a stylist Lino Villaventur organized.
Marke has been working actively in the theatre and in the cinema for more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of a suite for many famous paintings.

Tony Blair said that he would take the chance of returning as British Prime Minister, but admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has avoided much of the British policy debate, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
In response to a question whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so..."
Milana's main coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret at the result of the 10th tour of Italy's Lazio Championship.
The specialist also noted that the failure on the start was due to a series of injury to leading players.
I'm so sorry we couldn't win, and I'm bringing Tmw to Allegry's words.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
The second Romans were added, but I can't say in general that we've lost concentration.
I had to win.
Last season, we performed the task of getting to the Champions League.
Now we're behind schedule, but it's due to a series of injuries to key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who had a high-level meeting.
The experts of the counterproductive events that went to Cardiff to fight for the "Loshade of the Year" prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolgirl, just a few months before he took his first steps, this kid with his pet, Shetland Pony Toffy, ratted in three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This undiluted couple - the same growth - received high ratings for the appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sannibenk Horse Sports Centre in the town of Radri near Cardiff.
When he came to a general view against the background of men and women in fine hats, he moved his hat and was proud to have spent a couple of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for him for years and not for the developed ingenious ability to deal with horses.
And Toffy got a high grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy for his third birthday last March, and since then he's been with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make a beautiful duet."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vail in South Wales, is walking down the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Hawells, who has laid horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Hawells said, "The whole audience was struck, and everyone yelled with approval and clapping."
He ran through the sand all over the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did a fine job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he started, he's about to be involved in "Loshadi of the Year" - and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
The representative of this annual cone said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves on the show.
They assess the coherence of the pony and the factory, Fenton and Toffy, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper, which published the appeal, "to be restructured"
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the first page a call for the release of the accused in the slander of the reporter, must be reorganized, reports to the press regulator.
The newspaper "New Express" published in Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a state share of property.
Now, the New Express has to go through a process of complete correction of errors, as the regulator reports.
The "mistake" order came from the Guangdun Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television.
The preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group published a number of false reports on the company Zoomlon registered on the exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
The "New Express Guide" was disoriented, as stated in the regulator's statement.
He states that it has been decided "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yunzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporting licence."
He also directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the New Express errors and recommended that it investigate the newspaper ' s situation and immediately amend the New Express leadership.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles for the New Express, which claimed financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlinon.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first strip, stating that she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, recognizing that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I damaged Zoomlin, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public confidence," he said to the public broadcasting company CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsty for money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express issued an apology on the first strip saying that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects have admitted on television.
Experts say that the practice of evaporating confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to speak.
U.S. Tunnel - Mexico for the transfer of drugs equipped with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel as a four-foot tunnel as one of the most difficult secret moves they've ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzagi are the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, United States.
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitates the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were easily diverted, as stated by the authorities.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution purposes.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico following the harvest of marijuana in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been raised since November
In Belarus, pensions have been raised since November this year, and BELTA's correspondent has been informed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection's General Directorate of Pension Security.
As of 1 November this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic applied to the previous pension recalculation will be adjusted to an increase of 5.4 per cent and the corresponding re-costing of employment pensions will be carried out in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recosting of the age pension from November, it is estimated that the average increase will be 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension will be Br2 million, 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month since November this year.
In parallel with the recosting of employment pensions in November this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements will be recalculated due to an increase in the subsistence budget on average per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 530 by 2.1 per cent higher than in effect from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, minimum employment pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent as from 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion-0- is being applied to pensions based on increases in 2013.
British police give Assanju a notification of extradition
The British police today issued a notice of extradition to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanja, who fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian "official requirement to surrender" to the police station, adding that if the requirement was not met, he would be further arrested.
Assanju is in danger of being extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his powers under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, on 19 June he fled to the Embassy of Ecuador in London, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard "has given a 40-year-old man a formal demand to surrender, which requires him to come to the police station on the day and time of our choice," as the press secretary has reported.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification given to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic depots on the anti-secret Web site of WikiLeaks.
Driver driving 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1000
The vehicle was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
A 35-year-old Andrew Howie, from Tidtry, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 highway in Braintre on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink on his outboard between his legs.
In Kolchester Howie's court of law, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven penalty points resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Houi also made a commitment to pay the cost of £90 and an additional fee of £100 to assist victims of crime.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will result in a London bubble bursting
The Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital growth tax, but looks forward to a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, introduced a State duty rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own houses in a partnership rather than as natural persons.
So far, the State is home to Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which amounted to £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hambera together.
Mr. Cook stated: "After the increase of the State's power over expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is very difficult to claim that taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of an outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move may result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners not wanting to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate - the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price - in the rich south-west belt of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew to record 11.8% over the past year.
According to Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6 per cent in annual terms, but were overshadowed by an active "other market" with surge prices in south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) cities.
Scientists shed light on how the tail movement of dogs is connected to her mood.
Early studies have shown that good dogs are slamming their tail on the right side (from the point of view of the dog), while troubled dogs are smashing their tail primarily on the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the Psych family can notice these subtle differences in tailings and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Wallortgara, neurobiologist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of drivers that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it from other species.
He added that, like a man, dogs had the right part of the brain controlling the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the different twisting of the tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured animal heart rate and analysed their behaviour.
Perhaps we'll soon find out why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Professor Vallortgara said, "We showed dogs videos with dogs, either naturalistic versions or silhouettes, to get rid of any other distortion factors, and we could manipulate tail movement and direct tails more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw that, in the rest of the world, nothing to express the dog had moved the tail to the right (in terms of the whirlwind dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mostly to the left (new from the point of view of the whining tail dog), their heartbeat was getting better and they looked troubled.
Professor Wallortigara said he didn't think dogs had been deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and what they should not be concerned about.
He observes: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tailings are associated with more friendly behaviour, and the right side gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
A dog behaviour expert, John Bradshaw, an invited scientist at the Bristol University Veterinary School, said that it was not the first study to check whether the left and right side were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at a happy dog.
And in another research work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: "The dogs were more likely to approach the robot dog when her tail was being driven left than right instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite attitude towards Italian research."
He said that differences could be because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
" While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are not an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, we will probably soon see why their tails are sometimes headed one way or another.
Arctic Monkeys is delaying a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness.
Arctic Monkeys' rock band postponed the concert to Glasgow after her vocalist had been diagnosed with a laringitis.
This Sheffild Group was supposed to be playing at Hydro's city concert site on Friday.
However, Alex Turner's vocalist's disease forced them to move the show.
The group ' s statement was made after she had to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday as well.
In a statement on their official Arctic Monkeys website, they said: "After deciding to move the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical care, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at Hydro's Heydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"Alexa Turner was diagnosed with "laringitis," and unfortunately he is unable to perform."
The show on LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show at Glasgow will take place on November 21 at Hydro.
All tickets to this show remain valid.
We want to apologize to all the owners of the tickets for any inconvenience that caused them.
In order to obtain any additional assistance, please contact the customer service department of the ticket register in which you purchased tickets.
Papa Francis will call the first cardinals in February.
Papa Francis will build new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as the Vatican declared on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching his 80-year-old Cardinal, he can no longer take part in the father's election - the prerogative of the 120-year-olds.
In announcing this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a congregation of all the current cardinals known as consistry would be held before the San Ceremony.
"Papa Francis decided to report in advance on his decision to convene a consistorium in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from around the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voice said that the number of cardinals would probably decline by February.
He said that Dad usually calls as many cardinals as he needs to re-take the number of cardinals to 120, as well as as as as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The story next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis was elected last March, according to Valero.
So far, there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe, and particularly in favour of Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if a new dad would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance," he noted.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
It will also be the first chosen cardinals since the formation of the French Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said "fully possible" that Francis would turn to Cardinals for advice.
But we weren't in a situation like this before -- this is all for us for the first time.
Valero said that dads used to be the Cardinal of Bishops from the major parishes, but Francis is "a full of surprises - so we don't know who he's going to call."
GM selects a number of new U.S. pickups to refine seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra of the 2014 model to address problems with manual seat back adjustment, in accordance with the notification from U.S. regulatory authorities on Friday in the area of vehicle safety.
On some of the pickups, front seats may be defective in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"In the rear impact of a vehicle, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury," as indicated in the notification on the website of the National Road Safety Administration.
The models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The launch of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of a car in serial production for the leading American auto manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Authority could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The cry of despair of Obama's elector
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change
He said that Obama had allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to reverse commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama's reformed health system website, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama Campaign Memoires are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second student at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I read a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me at a time of despondence in the second year of the medical school and restore my sense of hope.
It's called "Dearness for Victory," and it's the 2008 memoirs of Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patients' reports tonight and go to bed, this book brings me back at a time when politicians inspired millions of people, and the performances could take over the spirit.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programmes were making a pause to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried for joy, and my parents took care of all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
During Obama ' s assumption of office in 2008, its level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a gross awakening, like a crumbling out of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I put down my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
That was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military personnel from Iraq, the lifting of the rule "Don't Ask, Don't say," the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of the Guantánamo base among others.
But after a countless times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended up with explanations that I could provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to wire foreign leaders or to strike drones against innocent children in other countries.
He can't explain the collection of data on American private life by the National Security Agency or the persecution of the decoupling agents who reveal the illegal actions of the Government.
He cannot explain the killing of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaq, without trial or investigation, or the failure to comply with State funding and expenditure limits during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
It has recently been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple web site for more than three years following the signing of the law on accessible health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership might run counter to political campaigns that preceded him?
It is clear that elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have cited above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an unclear and rude alternative, which seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that, in my second term, Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
It makes me miss the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that described Clinton's stunning defeat in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyse the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to return our appeal," he said.
- We must remember who we are."
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in the commentary are exclusively of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr. Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest with regard to parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnesium, which has an unresolved debate on the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he was trying to avoid questions as to whether he had a conflict.
The combined Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to set aside carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be with ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughter would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will be granted leave or not," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the battle for the seat of Sanshin-Kost of the Fairfax electoral district, with a suspension of 53 votes after the vote had been re-elected.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the procedure for counting votes in elections in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget's daughters.
Should the election be decided two months after we voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
The use of pencils today seems weird.
The Electoral Commission is examining the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshein Cost and would "very seriously" take his new work.
Public office involves serving society.
"We do not seek any reward except thanks to history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its currency transaction unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is yet another indication that the global scrutiny of alleged currency manipulation regulators is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS officers to be suspended during an ongoing investigation, which echoes the scandal of manipulation with the LIBOR interbank rate.
By refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation of this matter continues, and we fully cooperate with FCA and other our regulators," reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, well-known individuals said that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages that received and sent it to the former British Regulatory Trading Authority, the Financial Control Office (FCA).
This tracker, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as he is aware, he has been granted leave for his current position as head of European currency swaps at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchananni, head of the European Citi Spot Trading, left on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior exchanger in Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s instantaneous contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss controller Finma said that he was investigating alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six global regulators - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal inspections or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, and told the person who was familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking at instant messages and e-mails over a few years in search of offences.
The audit news has led to the emergence of traders in the field of activities, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of revenue of the trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has been difficult because the low volatility of currencies reduces the opportunities for merchants.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation, saying that a vast and high-profile foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say it's not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous volume of daily trading on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that "you can begin to influence the market at a very small price."
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of the traders in his stock trading department of the London Exchange this week, after he had caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the authorities concerned and cooperated with its regulators.
"We are confident that the traders acted alone and that this issue has been localized," Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama ' s Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama ' s landmark health law was constitutional, a major victory for Obama ' s administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Accessable Health Act requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance before 2014 or to pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act that states improve compliance with the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business have sought to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the rose?
In the State Duma, in the framework of the Open rostrum, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
The suggestions included banning football in the North Caucasus, because this game was a scandal and a pink one.
Spyker Sergei Narashkin recalled recent events in Birülev and said that in order to reduce the level of social tension, politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the television broadcasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wires if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and of measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to discussion of sombourity.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Birülev were a "model conflict that could be predicted" but "there are too many people and organs answer for these questions," and seven young children have no eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe had long practised against migrants had failed, in the opinion of a societyman, and needed to find a way.
The historian Yuri Petrov has given great hope to a new unified history textbook.
"There is also a need to create a manual on the history of the culture of the nation's peoples, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan and vice versa," he reported.
Gennady Züganov suggested criminalizing "the calls to dismember Russia": "If the US says on radio that it is necessary to hand over to Alaska Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years of prison!"
Vladimir Girinovsky was trying very hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused all journalists who put sick and acute national problems in public discussion: "There's not much to say in the dust."
The leader of the "One Russia" faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude "the charter" and to agree to talk about the subject carefully, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, Mr. Vasiliev stated.
He cited as an example a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for inter-national peace in their territories.
But Ludmila Andrichenko wasn't happy about this law: there's no "clear idea of how migrants adapt, how they are, how they are, and how they are.
So the actors will treat the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the capacity to deal with such complex issues, there is no means, and the guidance they could use is not given to them by the center...
The head of the Thought Committee on Nationalities of Gajimet Safaraliyev proposed the establishment of a special department with a threatening name, the Ministry of National Security, to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar department in the 1990s, later abolished, opposed.
It's enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "Minister without a portfolio" that could be contacted if anything.
"We walk along the edge, the shells run around, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions together to oppose provocations, and this work should receive adequate information support," said the representative of the RTC for association with the Society of Allvolod Chaplin.
The neutrality of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should not be in its view.
This is where Oleg Nilov led the discussion to an unexpected path: "Better talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be searched, but they are pushed on the wrong path, wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There's another sport called rugby...
"They're not gonna be happy in the world in this sport!" he spoke with the law.
There's no one in the Caucasus playing rugby! Mr. Girinovsky intervened.
You're gonna offer them some more kerling!
We need to know the national characteristics, it's like the load of the "Charter" to offer...
In Jaroslavla, wild behavior on the podiums was distinguished by the Moscow Club - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the Russian Federation Monitoring and Discipline Committee, Arthur Grigorianc, reported that Cuban was fined 500,000 roubles, transferring Philip PAPENKOV, from the Football House.
Such sanctions against the Reddar Club were imposed on the flag of Dagestan by fans on the rostrum during the 14th tour at the household match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from FRFL.
We've been researching all the materials available.
The wrong behaviour of the Cuban viewers is fined 500,000 rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei has been sued on Nortel patents.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent actions on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, whose price was interrupted at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed claims for infringement of patent rights with the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key Internet search words with their respective advertising, as stated in Google's claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make telephones working on the Android operating system from Google, which competes heavily with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in which part of the key factor was the Motorola Patent Library.
"In spite of an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a claimable patent at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate it," the lawsuit states.
Rockstar requires increased recovery from Google because he claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, as required by the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President takes the oath
Mohammed Murcy takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Mursi promised "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in by 18 judges in black mantles in the courthouse on the bank of Neil, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Murcy during a solemn ceremony broadcast live on State television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, most of its 84 years of existence, was a banned organization that was the target of hard action by successive Governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Murcy arrived with a small cortege shortly after 11:00 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new president, and unlike the Presidential Pompa of the Mubarak era, the movement was stopped for only a short time to miss his convoy on a normally busy road connecting the centre of the city to the southern suburbs.
Although Murcy was ridiculed as a non-charistic "passion wheel" of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to represent himself as a candidate not only of Islamists, but also of all those who wanted to bring the 2011 uprising to the end against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State," said Murcy, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in a wooden panel where he took the oath.
Murcy later went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing the State Anthem, during which he stood on the stand "with peace."
There was a military activist, Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was met by the slogan "Armia and the people are one hand," which was scanned by hundreds of gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a centrepiece of secular education, became a pillar of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi accepted a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the rebellion was born, ending the authoritarian reign of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the powers of the President, who had been deprived of his office by the military council, who had taken cases from the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the courts, not before Parliament, as accepted, he exercises the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Murcy's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatre populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Teumen Region Engineering Association was held on the basis of the Yalutor road factory.
The event included a presentation of a new line for the production of electric welds from steel.
As the commercial director of Denis Gribanov ' s business explained, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was conducted in 2011 with the new owner ' s arrival.
It turns out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
It was then decided to change the profile of the plant and to install equipment for its production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the factory amounted to more than 120 million roubles, told Denis Gribanov.
A new station was launched in October, allowing for an increase in the range.
The plant produces both a small section of the pipe that is used for telecommunications, small construction and furniture, and a large one for the construction industry.
We plan to reach 50,000 tons of production per year, which will represent about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it stands at 157, and in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is retrained and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
Next year, a new longitudinal cut is planned to be introduced to a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another plant, at a rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company was about to learn about the production of pipes used in the housing and community sector.
The company ' s management aims to close up to 70 per cent of the need for the products in the Tumen region.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, addressed to industry managers, recommended that more attention be given to the upgrading of engineering facilities.
This is also aimed at the form of government support for industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates for new equipment and leasing costs.
This year, 150 million roubles are earmarked for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will review subsidy contracts, adopts documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget is reimbursed for the participation of local producers in international fairs.
A budget of 150 million roubles is available for the next year to compensate for leasing fees and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs and 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
It is reduced to 72 million roubles for the reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment produced in the south of the Tumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumova, this form of support would eventually cease, as the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies had paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct spending obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government has prioritized direct support for industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented at work.
Many enterprise managers expressed concern about the emerging oil situation.
The grant of equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the southern Tumen region industry and, when cancelled, it will be difficult to compete at the price of the average strip of Russia, where the cheaper labour force is.
In addition, there is no question of the continuity of the new owner of the R&D TNCs, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders on the Tunisian enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Ottawa Project will expire in 2013 and no requests for extension have been received.
Currently, the southern sector, which specializes in oil and gas equipment, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
There is an open question whether taxes from oil originating in the Utwa region will come into the region ' s budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomich's gonna work 240 hours for an extremist video on social media.
The Lenin District Court of Tomska sentenced 240 hours of mandatory work by a cityman who posted extremist video on the social network, to inform RIA Novosti on Friday by a representative of the Regional Court press service.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
Criminal proceedings were instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code, "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as the humiliation of human dignity committed publicly."
"The Lenin District Court examined the case in a special manner and found a man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory work," the interviewer of the agency said.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a loss in the prices of goods after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the prices in the country will decline significantly after the country has signed an association agreement with the European Union.
He spoke about this in his Facebook relationship with readers.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area Regulation, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should be reduced.
"It's about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the price agreement would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
But there shouldn't be price increases there either.
So the reports on the billboards, which have recently appeared quite much in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, isn't exactly the case, or, more specifically, not the same," have summarized Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Biisk
On 29 October, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in Biska had locked a child in the basement for educational purposes.
All circumstances are currently being clarified by investigators, as well as a legal assessment of the activities of kindergarten officers.
After being accused of mis tasted by Eugenia Vasiliev, he conspired.
Eugenia Vasiliev, whose character has been closely alerted to the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous press publications both on thefts in the Ministry of Defence and on her personal relationship with the ex-defence minister Anatoly Serduk, her poetry and her addiction to valuables.
On 1 November, however, the figure of the Oronservice case violated silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasiliev, he stated: "Of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail about what I had to testify, or I'd be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We're going to court next, we're gonna prove our innocence.
We're 100% confident in winning.
In this interview, it can be concluded that perhaps the most important thing was that Vasiliev had been told that she didn't have any good taste.
The statement made by the official representative of the SC of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that counterfeits had been found in the collection of paintings collected by the figure of the Oronservice case.
Among the property arrested, there are a number of paintings that the owner, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of the world painting.
However, the art examiner appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, simply, were cheap counterfeits," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from the Defense Department, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss any personal moments?
I think it's just a mess," Vasiliev says.
However, to the question of whether she accepted her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes that she was charged with, Vasiliev stated: "Indeed, no.
There's nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
It's just that people are misleading, that's all.
In addition, in response to today ' s statement by the UK of the Russian Federation that Vasiliev was reluctant to study the criminal case file, a figure lawyer stated that he and his client "the investigator are not allowed to know the case file."
What led to the discovery of a house arrester, Vasileva, who still had no contact with the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or is it the right of Komsomolka journalists who said a couple days ago that she "was in more trans under house arrest" because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdukov with his wife and his return to the family bed?
Viktor Baranitz, known as KP, wrote in his article "Serduks returned to his wife?" "The investigators do not rule out that, after such a shock, she may become more talkable during interrogations."
In the past, Vasilieva was charged with the illegal sale of immovable property by the Ministry of Defence.

Flight Centre appears to have a reverse trend.
The company updated its profit forecast for the full year and looks forward to the record income of the resters in Australia and Britain.
This tourism firm now expects its main full annual return to taxation to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with its previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current benchmarks are achieved, this will be 12 to 17 per cent growth compared to the record gain of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The manager, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre received 8 per cent of the profits in the first half of the year and began the second half with good performances, especially on a week trip to Australia and Britain.
"In the period since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits from our 10 countries, and for some of them, a record high return is expected for a full year, up to the deduction of interest and tax contributions, " he said.
- This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the largest profits."
In Australia, the leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offset by a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre's business in recreational activities was well spent, while corporate clients were spending less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses sustained during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and the third full-year profit is expected.
Yesterday, the Flight Centre stock grew by three cents to $38.020.

At the time of the inspection, the game was in place.
There were 24 machines in the club.
Another game club was found in Lenin district on Anton Petrov Street.
It used 20 game machines.
The Russian UMVD for Barnaulu reports that administrative material has been prepared under the article "Illicit organization and conduct of gambling."

In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who has brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation on the Sverdlovsk region, the day before the day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after the burning of a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Ural Street, two women were found dead with signs of violent death.
Soon the identity of the victims was identified.
It turns out that they are sisters, one of whom is a 44-year-old woman in Ekaterinburg, and the other is a 33-year-old resident in Orenburg.
They rented a burning apartment a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the main police region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are processing various versions of the murder, verifying the alibi of previously convicted citizens and those who are inclined to commit such acts.
In addition, it is established for the purpose of women ' s renting an apartment and where they lived before doing what they were doing with whom they were in contact.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, orthography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, the 19th century novel, romantic poetry and modern British art literature from 1914 onwards.
The examination will also be presented with "non-programme texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate language examination, with persistent recommendations for the choice of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to issue new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject to radical review.
It will change other substantive items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the examination area OFQUAL will present the revised structure of the secondary examination, with a new system of assessments and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there was "a broad consensus that we must reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence," insisting that school graduation examinations would be "more complex, more ambitious and more stringent."
Research shows that English schools spend less than a year ' s math time (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours per year, while Singapore has about 138 hours of schooling.
Although there would be no formal requirement to devote more time to math, the coalition sources said that large-scale school math exams, coupled with an increased rating factor in the rating table, would likely serve as an incentive to provide schools with additional education on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be given to "real life gain," including financial mathematics.
The Heiha tickets are gonna be for tourists at 2,200 roubles.
Since tomorrow, tourists will start taking ships in the air pillow from the Blade in Heiha.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra spending.
It's traditionally much more expensive to spend on the puma than on the heat.
According to AmurASSO's reference service, the cost of the regular ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
It's gonna cost 2,800 rubles through the high comfort hall.
By the way, the tickets weren't expensive in this season: at the same price, the puma was raised by tourists and last spring, and a year ago in the fall.
Dmitri Bearev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Bearev considers the Russian Federation to be inadequate in its GDP growth rate and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned GDP growth in the area of 3% this year, maybe just a little more.
It's gonna be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not too bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries and, in general, for development, must be higher.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russia's business, receive normal loans at normal prices - the first thing that needs to be done" - emphasized the head of government.

Travel on dirt, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwell provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bevelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this western African country - only one per 5,000 people
Hang in here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes to become the Hero of the year CNN.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father returning to life and returning to unconscious status, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwellet was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only broken his hand, but the infection that occurred spread to the brain and called a hematoma that reminded herself for the rest of her life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwellet accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy, " said Bwelle.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first one, but you're not the first one.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwellet died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor per 5,000 in Cameroon.
By comparison, the United States ratio is one doctor per 413.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them wouldn't have been in their pocket.
Two out of five people in the country lived below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the health expenditure was private.
"The only problem is poverty, " said Bevelle.
- And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
As he saw the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, he was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes community visits on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and another 30 people get into the vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs, and travel across the area to visit the villages in need.
They don't always have good luck.
They've had to push cars through rivers and mud on several occasions.
But when they come, they meet them like real heroes: it's a party with songs and dances and better rooms that local people can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for the celebration, and Bwelle, with his wide smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people on every trip," said Bwelle.
They come from all over the neighborhood within a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they walk.
Each of these day off clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can obtain crutches, glasses or free birth certificates - documents needed for schools, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
At night, the team carries out simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally carried out in the school, municipality or house building; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op zone to free the next person's place.
Using an operating and sanitation generator, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's an inexhaustible pace, but the team's commitment usually helps support village musicians.
"They've been hitting drums all night to keep us awake and to keep working," said Bwell.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to town, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment operation would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said a man.
In addition to these weekend clinical admissions and work at the hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works nights at private health clinics around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he said, which provides 60 per cent of the financing of his non-profit organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwelle's group.
He's always at the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, it is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove the blood stains or keep the tools for Dr. Bwell," said O'Malley.
As a graduate student, you would never have been able to do so in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training are paid to Bevelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon endlessly.
For Bwell, the almost constant workload is not a heavy test.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling their father's promise is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job, " said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wire.
The deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FRG Attorney General in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor ' s telephone by the U.S. specialist.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear, "Gans-Cristian Strebele said, "that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are starting to respond to a scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all fields and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Makei, made this statement to journalists at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, reports by BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all fields and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two governments will provide widespread cooperation and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves." Vladimir Makei noted.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had taken place in Ankara, following which a protocol had been signed.
The parties have developed a road map for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and avenues of interaction.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey view each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkey ' s Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, reported that, in the negotiations held, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the Minister, the trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is an untapped potential in this area.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
Also, all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," noted Ahmet Davutoğlu.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care.
In the midst of the criticism storm, President Obama went to the back of his often repeated, unequivocal promise yesterday that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
As hundreds of thousands of people have been notified of the suspension of services from their providers, Republicans have criticized the President in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few adjustments to his original public promise.
"The majority of people with medical insurance that works can keep it," he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called "survivors on the news" about the interruption of services, Obama called on Americans receiving these notifications to look for other market options.
Most people will be able to obtain better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Access to Health Care Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sibelius in a speech to the committee on energy and commerce of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who supervises the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the Internet sales site had been "unbelievablely bad" since October.
"I'm upset and angry just like everyone else," she said.
- I really want your trust back."
Disturbed Sibelius dropped that phrase, which was captured by an active microphone behind her by an assistant sitting at yesterday ' s hearings in the chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, whether she was obliged to join Obama ' s health programme.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the architect of the law on affordable health care did not voluntarily renounce government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposed on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt has been denied media status for an uncensored battle.
On 31 October, Mosgorud decided to declare an invalid registration licence for Rosbalt, "Lenta."
In the Agency ' s deprivation of media status, Roscomnadzor insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial, an unfortunate precedent was established: the court considered it possible to close the media by effectively denying the publication the right to submit counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened a second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representation in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognized private InternetMS in Russia.
In doing so, Rosbalt has always held a rather specific niche: the agency ' s exclusive publications core has been (and are still) marked with reference to sources within law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
While Rosbalt had an extensive source base in various departments, it also suggested that Natal Chaplin, the wife of Victor Čerkesov, was the head of the project.
However, Chaplin's role in the Rusbalt manual is not clear: it is often referred to as "project manager."
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.
More recently, Rosbalt has not been included in federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the Agency ranked 25th in the ranking of the Russian media sites on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the Rusbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), with about three million unique visitors per month.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months is the notes on the Kreml's powerlessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soleist of the King and the joke group, and the thunderstorms in the capital city of Birülev.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the Media Act came into force, prohibiting journalists from engaging in a non-censorship.
The government found a banned lexic in two videos published on the website by Gigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot defiled the oil towers.
Further parties describe differently.
Roscomnadzor, on the basis of the video footage found, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to remove his licence from the agency.
In Rosbalte, it was stated that the agency ' s claims were unlawful: first, the pieces were not editorial materials; secondly, the mathematical words were masked; and third, immediately after the warning of the video, were removed from the site.
The representatives of the Agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor to the world court - and when Mosgorud took the Roskomnadzor claim on 22 October 2013, those complaints were still pending.
However, 25 of the world's judges have decided not to favour Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolay Ulynov has found himself guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 roubles - 10,000 each.
Obviously, this has allowed the outcome of the Moscow hearing - if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been passed earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate the Rosbalt registration certificate, effectively depriving the media agency of its status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (the announcement made on 10 October by Alexander Zharov, Head of Roskomnadzor, signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CDF).
The President of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Allvolod Bogdanov, Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Guzev and Head of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the publication had not been closed.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roskomnadzor's leadership had even given him some assurance that the case would not come before the revocation of the licence.
The Rusbalt trial has shown that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus one day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare war poisoning substances for use, handing over Bibi-si.
The destruction of the stocks of poisoned substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, poisoning substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people died in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.
The primary task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy infrastructure to mix chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent repair.
The next milestone, mid-November: By that time, OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who's gonna provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly checked by Western intelligence agencies.
They will readily advise the inspectors of new inspection facilities if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely revealed.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with Russia's mediation - destroy or render unworkable all facilities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and filling of the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be the destruction of the Syrian army ' s already existing chemical weapons.
It is estimated that more than 1,000 tons of neuro-paralytic poisoning substances, lumbar mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different places can be found in this arsenal.
Its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a schedule of action, which will take two weeks.
The head of the OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, stated to the BBC that his inspectors were "sawing the destruction of equipment."
"They are no longer able to further manufacture or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the projectiles and poisoning plants were either destroyed or unwitting.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical infrastructure was "especially difficult" because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was time to celebrate with the inspectors until they found out that they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that US spying has gone "incomplicatedly far"
John Kerry has shown a easing of U.S. surveillance tactics, making unprecedented recognition that, in some cases, US spying "has gone far. "
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "in autopilot" at the time Edward Snowden's loud disclosures about NSA spying activities.
These leaks have placed the US Government at the heart of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, actually took some of the things that are happening on the autopilot because this possibility already existed - both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war, and of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to recognize that US spying had gone too far, but stressed that no one ' s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone far.
And the President is determined to shed light on this issue and explain to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that its tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented aircraft crashing, building explosions and killing people, because we were able to learn about those plans in advance."
Meanwhile, American legislators will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US spying abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, told the Senate ' s subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the disappointment of the National Security Agency ' s surveillance.
"In the interests of national security, it is indeed important for the Europeans to remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said the Democrat Murphy, who served as the first term and Chairman of the Senate's Sub-Committee of International Relations on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
- And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes."
The news that NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The National Intelligence Director, James Klapper, defended spying against allies as necessary and said that it was a common matter on both sides.
In the light of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by Congress members, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would be composed of members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote a better relationship, he said that some degree of "hardness from better motives" would also be evident.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programs they had used for many years.
"As we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect Europeans' rights, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the issues of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as United States intelligence.

The control of the RNA is being controlled by the struggle between human rights defenders and the lobbyists of the militia.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the development of the CPR, I suggested that the selection of human rights experience should be a criterion.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were drawn up without the criteria" says Valerie Borschov.
Borschov is the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the entire Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a member of the State Duma of the Apple, he has drafted a law regulating the activities of the NCA.
The PES Council shall vote for the composition of the NCs in 43 regions of the country.
For 1,800 vacant seats, fewer than 1,000 applicants are sought, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions were unable to organize because of the absence of candidates.
OP promises to set up a board for vacant seats.
ONC Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, even though 40 participants will be in the new membership instead of 20.
According to Borzchev, the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 members of the armed forces and, in the version of the PD, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
However, 30 human rights defenders were wanted to join the capital commission.
But the new composition may be re-assigned by Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the RNA for three years, but he never visited the prisoners.
Borschev believes that the militia, by appointing their chairman of the CNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the movement of the troops is coordinated by the member of the RNA, Anton Flowers, who heads the Russian officers, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast, " said RBC daily Anton Flowers.
He denied that he was lobbying for the movement of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
He wasn't even interested in what list he was now voting for.
He considered the publication of the Bearing Information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Chilean CNC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's copie unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the local commission ' s management had ignored prisoners ' problems.
And the Roztonova-na-Dono SNC can move from human rights defenders to the militia.
Of the new lists, the Human Rights Defenders Chairman of the Local Commission was one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical conduct.
The records of the Moscow and Growth Commissions of Borschchev consider "the place for the Kopeisk."
Hopes of Toloconnikov were not affected by the Mordovica OC, which is considered "strong": only one human rights defender wanted to join, and she did not even have the documents for the competition.
A member of the POP, Nikolai Swanidze, told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His PP colleague Paul Guzev said that he had voted in favour because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the compilation of lists by the Deputy Secretary of PES, Vladislav Grib, also a member of the FIN Research Institute.
Grib told RBC daily that he did not consider it appropriate to separate candidates for human rights defenders and militia, and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to obstruct the work of its members.
Grib is not taking the lead in predicting the outcome of the OP Council ' s vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a revised version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman filing an appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days of prison on Phuket Island for a false claim that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false claim after the Thai police reported that the local taxi driver had attacked on the night of Sunday on 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment in the general prison centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who approached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for his daughter's help.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "brainedly concerned" about the well-being of her daughter and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
"It's obvious that it was an alarming time, but we hope she'll come home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she currently spends her vacation in the Kraby resort zone in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could lead to an increase in the court ' s sentence of up to two years ' imprisonment and would force her to serve in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his novel, "Eltisheva," translated into French.
Remember, it was his novel that became the finalist of four prizes, "Black Pole," "Russky Booker," "National Bestseller" and "Big Book."
Last year, a writer for this book was awarded a cultural prize from the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is an uncertain leader in the generation of the current 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosaics.
Virtually every publication of its hard-core, modern-day life stories and narratives is causing hot debate among critics in a variety of ways.
It can be argued that the compilation of articles on the prosthetic and publishing of Senchin, the reviews of his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the discussion of "one of the most controversial modern writers," according to the criticism of Sergei Chuprinin, it is largely said that its participants understand "literacy" as we see the present and the future not only of our words, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and review articles tend to be reduced in the Abzac sections...
