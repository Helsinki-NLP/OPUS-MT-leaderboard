In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hangers had attempted suicide.
On October 30, about 1 - 00, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging in Lugova village.
He's known to have attempted suicide before.
What led a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old male resident of Kineshma killed himself at home by hanging.
No signs of violent death have been found, as reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs' press service, "Kineshemski."
Black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the cracking highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box carefully installed on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track each vehicle mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated system of funding for American highways undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena suddenly generated intense debates and color alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass, and even possibly where you pass them - and then to use this information in tax accounts.
Tea movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
Although Congress is not yet in a position to agree whether or not to continue, several states are not going to wait.
They're thinking about how over the next decade we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not a matter on which we may have a choice," said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Southern California Government Association, who plans to start tracking the miles of each California motorist by 2025 by the state authorities.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Roads Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by Americans at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars travel more than miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't increased in 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise tax by even one cent at high petrol prices.
"The gasoline tax cannot be saved," said Lee Mannich, an expert in transport policy at Minnesota University.
In his state, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed to test the milling system.
"It would be the best alternative in the long run," he said.
The nerds call it a massive user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel in order to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking at the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuester (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the Chamber ' s transport committee, said that he also saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free-marketers in Reason are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go to a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards heavy payment.
The U.S. Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the fear of village legislators representing voters, who often travel many miles in daily life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
Oregon is the state with the greatest enthusiasm, with 5,000 drivers involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles instead of a gas tax.
The Nevada pilot project has already been completed.
It's under review in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with trucks.
And Coalition I-95, which includes the shipping departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can effect these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every step of them.
"Concerning about big brother and things like that is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who is the head of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada State Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: "It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there is a difficult search for low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of vehicle miles, but without information on place and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
Searching for this technology led some state agencies to a small, young company in California called True Mileage.
The company did not initially assist in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter a growing market for the type of car insurance in which drivers paid on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so if you don't track their speed and track their location," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There were a few big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do that.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles travelled by all the people of the state.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that will also accept parking pay, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect a real-time speed pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
"The automobilists will benefit from the benefits offered to them" is stated in the urban design document.
Some transport designers, however, are wondering if all the talk about a mileage is just a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Bay City Transportation Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for highway construction by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and a lot of other things.
The EU is preparing Ukraine ' s support measures in the event of Russia ' s economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a loan stand-by, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal was to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to a potential IMF loan, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences over funding modalities.
Nor does the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step to "B-" with "B" on Friday, believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive assistance.
However, the EU representatives say that IMF can be flexible in lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a stand-by option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now coming from Russia.
It could be a "North Flow" gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way to proceed if Russia "insulates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and is likely to result in a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but from other routes," added Reuters.
Russia is not a fight for pollution of cities by automobiles
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
Generally speaking, they were either re-engineered and expanded or attempted to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time of their use.
Singapore ' s example is well known, where there is a strict quota for the growth of private cars and the right to purchase them is auctioned.
Its price may be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fees for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green areas are being introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, also using high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012, with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the Director of Transport Pollution Control, Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Lee Kuncheng, said, the main objective of the five-year-old is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase by no more than 5 per cent the use of fuel per vehicle.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme are the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for road owners.
Among other things, the city's green five-year-olds measures include an accelerated shift from the rest of the country to Euro-fuel standards, the introduction of local eco-standards and vehicle and fuel labelling, restrictions on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (other than the creation of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and service vehicles), and the development of public transport (including high-speed vehicles).
Also among the vehicle innovations in Beijing are the prohibition of all private cars from driving within the fifth transport ring (the total of six in the PRC capital) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle licence plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for motor vehicles based on lottery (e.g. in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number in 2010).
According to the current State programme "Environment for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 "mobile sources" accounted for 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants into the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg nine times higher.
In the Russian Federation, the possibilities for restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities are only beginning to be considered.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Policy, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are clearly unpopular and can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters with little sensitivity to any regulatory influence - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users with a total population of at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of Moscow's total fleet).
The other day, the urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of the road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city centre is twice as equipped with roads as required, and most motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them in parking for a long time or simply on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build vaults rather than parking spaces, rather than expand, rather than reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians), and to restrict the use and location of personal transport within the boundaries of the protection zone of the historic centre (a common area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trading in Vologda will rise in half.
In the view of the city authorities, increasing fines would help to clean up Vologda and free the streets from random tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell are often not subject to appropriate sanitary controls.
Which means the health of the Vologians is in danger.
For example, the lower penalty for unauthorized trade for citizens will increase sixfold from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles from November, as reported by the Press Service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is, above all, a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer credit and massive cuts in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather that the structure of growth has slowed.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which is almost constant," said the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemens Grafe, presenting a quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
Today, Russia's nominal wage rise is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the cost-effectiveness of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimize staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10 per cent, then GDP by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
Companies have experienced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, commented the chief economist of the Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS, Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to lure outsiders or keep current employees.
Russia's consumption is supported by a very rapid increase in lending.
According to Mr. Grafe, this type of credit has no multiplier effect on the country ' s economy because of the very high consumer loan rates.
"The benefits to the economy of increasing demand for credit we have seen nothing, money does not go to the economy, but goes back to the same banks in the form of interest payments," said the economist.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting an increase in the backlog of unsecured loans.
Most of them are poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not often returned," noted Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, Russia's second threat to growth is a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
Vassily Solodkov, Director of the Institute of Banks, is now seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to public banks, were forced to attract high interest rates.
In response, the banks went to the war trail and started to lower credit rates - the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans with the same interest, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks don't give up dumping, Russia is facing a full-blown banking crisis, Vassili Solodkov believes.
The withdrawal of the licences of a number of banks in recent weeks is considered by the economist to be a harbinger of mass collapse.
"The government banks themselves cannot cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," warned the head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investment bank, because of the non-indexing of civil service and military salaries in the current version of the draft budget.
The impact on consumption will be mitigated in part by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and consequently by lower inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not grow (and the preconditions are not yet - see the certificate), consumption growth will still slow down, confidence in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantušin of Barclays Capital has yet to see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The primary risk is still the fall in the price of oil," he says.
He estimated that Russia's economy would start to decline at a cost of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise stakes.
This may mean that they didn't believe the C.B., who announced the transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Grafe said.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, but only interbank lending rates.
"It's the collapse of all hopes for the CD," Clemens Grafe said.
Banks use money obtained at CB auctions to manage their liquidity, not to lend to the economy.
Once the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the ruble.
"The CB will realize sooner or later that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the state plans to put the ruble in "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
But either we have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5 per cent), he thinks.
According to his estimate, the ruble is now artificially above 10%.
Only one road, to weaken, comes to the conclusion of the expert.
But if the CB drops even the shadow of doubt in the financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of a policy of easing the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much more.
In Chelyabinsk, the Second South Ural Convention was held.
The Forum marks the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The Congress was attended by delegations from all the towns and districts of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We have no differences or differences.
We live in full understanding," says Feofan, the mitropolit of Chelyabinski and Zlatoustsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of ethnic cultural associations in Chelyabinsk province was opened here.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on a U.S. exploration issue.
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence exposer, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Christian Ströbelé met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who was introduced by the deputy to the media in Berlin on Friday, it was stated that "while the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not offer any protection."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, reported Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary intelligence team, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the US completely," it should be used.
Mr. Ströbelé, a member of Parliament from the Green Germany Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbelé said that according to the lawyer of a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there "safe," said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "hard and constant" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that he was encouraged by the worldwide response to "his political discourse."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials - including in the United States - have found exposing an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Frontier Airlines will charge for handware
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 per passenger for carrying handbags aboard their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand-held storage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their ad on Wednesday stated that passengers could keep the entire can.
The new hand baggage charge applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said she'd charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers paid only when they got to land.
Frontier's representative, Kate O'Malley, said that the $100 bill should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for this," she said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second bag in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges fill as much as they can in hand baggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often leaves space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really about making money.
The fact is, the most loyal clients in the Frontier claim that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the front line can be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in the line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change of procedures on the website and at the Frontier registration desks is intended to guarantee that passengers will know about the assembly before they land.
Frontier's new collection for handware will not start until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling luggage costs money, and the passengers who need it should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
Most of them, however, did not deal with hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first charge for the handware three years ago, and another album by Allegian Air later followed its example.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant, Jay Sorensen, who closely monitored the surcharges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the fee for handware was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he was going to find on the way out when passengers faced an unusual collection of Spirit for their hand luggage.
"The landing process was the smoothest I've ever seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth grinding and a fight coming up on the way out.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who get soda or juice can keep the entire can and that coffee will be provided free of charge.
She's still gonna give out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused seven months after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier ' s manual treasure charge initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last step in attracting customers to their website.
Air companies pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to go to a travel online agency.
However, Frontier has gone far beyond all in this area.
In September, she began to give half the frequent flyer miles to clients who had bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles up to 25 percent of the mile.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier purchased from an online travel agency would give 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose their place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal customers in her home town of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
Revenue declined by 9 per cent and flight opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers for shutting down the site.
The concealed National Security Agency claimed on Friday evening that the interruption of their site for several hours had caused a technical failure, not hackers, as alleged online.
"NSA.gov was denied access for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update," reported the intelligence agency in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed "no service" [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site was still not available to some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Agency's internal secret network "not at all" had been hacked.
No classified information was in danger, the representative informed.
At least one online group of hackers claimed that it was responsible for disrupting the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to slam the target site with traffic until servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously super-secret NSA, once known as "No such Agency," has been at the centre of public attention and violent criticism in recent months, following a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programmes abroad and domestically, all of which are reactions to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing debate around the agency has given rise to allegations that today's incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier ' s profits fall with the drop in deliveries and orders for aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday, owing to the reduced number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its newest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of a prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it only flew three more times, raising questions as to whether the test phase was proceeding on schedule.
The results did not meet projections and resulted in a fall of more than 8 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating on Thursday from "over-market" to "median-market" because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
"Though the decline in the delivery of aircraft was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the performance of the Transport Division," said Dorksen in the stock market survey.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to gain a seat in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first pilot sample of the aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, hard orders on CSeries are not yet too high - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to verify the company's claims about fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of a new liner.
A total of 403 orders and arrangements are now available with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Officer, Pierre Baudouane, was confident that Bombardier would reach its goal of 300 hard orders by the time the first aircraft was launched for commercial use.
On Thursday, managers also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected," said Baudouane during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
All manufacturers plan tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break to update, which is what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test programme.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, and all the others will soon follow, as the company reported.
However, analysts are sceptical about the statement that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the date of commissioning and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015," said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, which ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted share income remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion gross income, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world ' s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that he had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The flight department's portfolio was $32.9 billion on September 30, without changing as of December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor," Boduan said.
Gross revenue from aerospace activities fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train producer, reported that gross revenue in this sector had risen by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit's portfolio was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than December 31.
The travel unit ' s income has been adversely affected by several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock, which also announced that Google Chief Finance Officer Patrick Pichet would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 percent to C$4.83 in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on a lower annual profit.
Japan's electronics producer Sony, after completing the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast of current fiscal year profits.
Sony ' s results from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected due to the decline in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which produced the first operating surplus of 5.2 billion yen in three years in the second quarter, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a difficult time, especially because of the decline in demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where company sales have grown rapidly, especially through automobile systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, Sony expects to earn 179 billion yen operating profits by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, against an estimated 230 billion yen earlier.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts expected this figure to be significantly higher at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to emerge from the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, the launch of smart hours was announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need to extract a smartphone 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced the annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% of the price in the morning at the opening of the Torogs in Tokyo, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene has been a catalyst for synapse formation.
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School found a protein that enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating new neurons.
The study is published in Science and can be summarized on the magazine ' s website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene had been broken, but how he performed his function was unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their function Foxp2 acts as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the speech-forming area of the brain.
He's doing this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by finding factors that stimulate synapse formation.
SRPX2 proved to be one of the 10 genes found by the authors, with Foxp2 as its only activity.
The fact that SRPX2 does affect Vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in a mice experiment.
When animal gene activity was artificially reduced, they cried less when they were separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of sound produced was restored.
Earlier, the mice also showed a link to the Vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene were squeezing at a higher and lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, consequently, its controlled SRPX2 is linked to purely "mechanical" sound formation or to more subtle processes.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned a gang leader about a police investigation was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to Nil Scarboro's criminal authority
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the King ' s Court of Liverpool.
Precious lawyer, who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta provided criminal authority to Neil Scarboro with classified information on his investigation into drug trafficking after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash and named "cool lawyer" among criminals was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarboro, which he had previously represented in a drug trial.
Officers observed 32-year-old Scarboro leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County of Lancashire while he was at a bar association dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was "regularly using" a Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarboro, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into the activities of the criminal association for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambridge, Mercisaide, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
42-year-old Ditta passed on information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Law Company in Blackburn, he was humiliated after having been found guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He admitted possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer was exposed after the police investigating Scarboro ' s activities found that he had spoken regularly to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting the drugs 60 percent pure in a black golf glove under a jurist's trash box.
Shortly after the release, Scarborough was repeatedly contacted by Ditt, who was at a dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta was "regularly using" cocaine after the tests found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their association was a "lawyer secret."
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out some credit cards, but all of them were confiscated and a hair sample was taken from him.
When he was questioned by the police, he said that, along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that, following important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them that they were known to detectives.
In the indictment, Ann White said, "If anyone knows they shouldn't break the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the limits of the usual relationship between counsel and the client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarboro, and he questioned his lack of interest.
Ditta didn't plead guilty and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I'd like to pass on the information to Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal offender as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of the criminal gangs, who have entrusted him with the task of obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt ' s investigation was conducted by Lancashire ' s highly dangerous organized crime unit, which has already convicted him of three cases of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire for a just punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years ' imprisonment following his conviction of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
An additional 35 persons involved in the scheme were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta arranged a question-and-answer session in which he said that his dream job was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal companion for him at dinner, Mohammed Ali, and motivation for work was inequality.
The Jaroslavla stadium was not ready to receive 22,000 viewers, noted by the police officers who were present today at the FRFC meeting.
The ticket programme is, in their view, approximately double.
During the 1/16 match of the Russian Cup final with Spartacus, only 1,000 stewards were involved under the regulation of 9,000.
Spartacus fans had 2,200 seats, or 10 per cent of the stadium capacity, but under agreement with the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
This data was released by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigorianz.
Americans overheard Japanese high-ranking officials.
On Friday, 1 November, a member of the United States intelligence services who chose not to reveal his name stated that the United States had been listening to telephone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
The man confirmed that there were several audition points in the rising sun country.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand had no intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite its alliance with Americans in the post-war period, is the target of intelligence activities, reported NHK.
No party has formally commented on this information.
Let's remind you, the news of the U.S. Secret Service surveillance of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been listening to Merkel's phone for the past 10 years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some accounts, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed had been the FRG and the US for decades were unacceptable for such surveillance of the head of government.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was willing to share the details of Angela Merkel's wiretapping with the German Public Prosecutor's Office.
The German flew to Moscow on purpose to meet a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria can bid grain as early as early as 2014
Bashkiria may bid grain during government procurement interventions as early as the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic, Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales into the intervention fund.
So far, the price on the market is higher, and there's demand.
"Possibly the grain will be put on the market after New Year's," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in 2013, 3.1 million hectares of crops were planted, including 1.7 million hectares of cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
The 2014 crop planted 550,000 hectares (105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area under the winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the birth has remained at the same level.
There's no Bratt Circle in the D.I.A.'s database that has Leps listed in the U.S.
The databases of Russian security forces of the Brato Circle, to which Washington listed Grigory Leps as singer, are not listed.
As Interfax noted in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, all databases were checked after media reports of Grigory Leps being placed by the U.S. Department of Finance on control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brother Circle," but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian Mafia," which allegedly operates abroad, is considered to be in the power structures.
"Even in the name of 'Brother Circle', there's some element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret box.
"It's all very similar to the PR," said the agency's interviewer.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced that it was listed on its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle" by Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lilan, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Ghafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the U.S. authorities, Grigory Leps "is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
At Grigory Leps' production center, they refused to comment on the U.S. allegations against the singer, calling them "delused."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama designated the Brother Circle syndicate as "a significant transnational organized criminal group" and instructed Minfin to "break up and stop their global criminal operations."
Placing a person on the U.S. minfin blacklists results in freezing his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with people living in the U.S.
Scandal video hit the police.
Toronto's head, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless acts, was caught smoking crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video record and were ready to launch an investigation against the town commander.
He stated that he would not leave his post, as reported by CNN.
Information that the authorities had evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but that he was vouch for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromised Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by guards around the summer of 2013.
Previously, the video had been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there had been no evidence.
The mayor himself has no comment on this.
He's just saying it's not his fault and he's not going to resign.
The video footage found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford Alexander Lisi, a 35-year-old friend, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illicit profits and conspiracy.
At times, Lisie acted as Rob Ford's driver.
The people of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He fought with journalists on several occasions, appeared drunk in public, allowed racist and sexist remarks.
Rostovaeroinvest recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the designer of the facility.
The value of the contract at Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the UAO press services, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and under the terms of the tender, the project is to be prepared and sent to the State Expert ' s Office in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and improvements to the airport complex.
In the first phase of construction, the terminal will have an inside area of 50,000 square metres, which may be increased in the future.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to accommodate about 5 million passengers and by 2035 it will have 6 million passengers.
At the time of the review, the architectural concept of the Southern Airway Complex, developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities around the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, and the company designed terminals C and E of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new airway complex at Kneevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov province and will replace the current growth of the Russian airport, which will be closed and eventually integrated into urban development.
The construction of the airway station is scheduled to begin in 2014, and the introduction of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
A Turkish politician announced a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the area of the town of Nusaybin in south-eastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish border town of Nusaibin Aishe Gekhan, located in Syria, announced a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, and told RIA Newst in the press service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PPD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed protests.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to secure the borders.
"Mer Nusaybina Aishe Gekhan, a member of the PPD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a fatal struggle," stated the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, and the Kurds have crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is a inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree to," quoted Aisha Gekhan of the party.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is scheduled to take place on 7 November in Nusaibin.
Venezuela will set the rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, the Bolívar, against the dollar for tourists.
On 1 November, Bloomberg reported this with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed a year to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand US dollars.
Venezuela would also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the Bolivians purchased in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific rate of the bolívara vis-à-vis the dollar will be determined at a later date.
In February Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolívara per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolívaras.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolívar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
On 18 October, the Minister of Oil and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, announced that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolívare.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing the prices of products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of Southra, Andrei Belmach, noted that it was still difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new chief coach.
This post became vacant following the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
Resignation occurred only a few hours ago, so to say how long it would take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, " ITAR-TASS says Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking into all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find some coach, but someone who's gonna work for a few years at our club and get some results with it.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" reported the newspaper, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is a continuation of government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would in fact allow the government to "take the media with a dead grip," while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "have been hit hard," and criticized the bill as "draconian."
The passage of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate mall.
The Kenyan media provoked the authorities ' anger by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops who were sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing an expensive mall.
The reaction of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass protests by the media.
Under the new law, publishing houses could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, with an additional risk of being "delisted," i.e. being denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM radio stations."
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called lively blogosphere.
Politicians realize that by shutting the media down, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya's media as a key source of restraint and balance in public life.
"The politicians who are left behind will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts appointed by the National Wage Commission and to restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new expenditure line in the utility payments of the voronezhians - the rent for the major repairs to the house.
The most approximate calculation for a standard two-bedroom apartment from the new year would be to pay between 100 and 400 roubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, fix the stairwells, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
Such a law has been approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Keynikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "In this case too, we also need to put in order the ordering of house repairs, the accumulation of funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow or Orenburg or elsewhere - it will be the establishment of State control over the spending of funds collected by residents for the renovation of multi-family homes."
Under the control of the State, there is now equity building.
The law that protects against frauds is approved by an alumni in final reading.
The document wasn't born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law lays down rights and obligations for all equity participants.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "It is no secret that abuses have also begun in this area, as the same collaborators fell in 98 and the same collaborators in the 2000s."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including by passing these two laws.
Under Voronje, it has been decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The Regional Parliament has adopted such a law not only under pressure from the Federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region are at least reduced.
In the past year, a little over 100,000 foreigners had taken up migration records.
But only one in five has issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Keynikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the law but are not criminals."
The court doesn't, and you have to deport them - they have to be kept somewhere.
The Federation had decided that regional funds should be used to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region, this is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk region.
Last but not least, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with five or more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
The budget then loses 3.5 million - but so do large parents.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt three or more babies will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
For example, a family of six persons - Dad, Mom, the natural child, and the 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State buys a housing unit of 108 square metres, for a total of 3,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the southwest neighborhood, it's an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage for that money in the district center.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralcaliya
The current board of directors of the UAO, Uralkali, has proposed the candidature of the arrested CEO, Vladislav Baumgertner, in Minsk, for a new board, and is reported on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner is on the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary shareholders ' meeting on 29 November, at which a new board of directors would be selected by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his arrest in August this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenka, stated at a press conference that the charges against Baumgertner had been re-characterized as "kidnapping."
The goalkeeper Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Crikunov's departure as a mentor to the Basjekamians.
Golkiper believes that Acting Chief Coach, Dimitri Balmin, has great authority among the players and will handle his duties.
Let's remind you, today, the oil chimney sent Creekunov to resign.
To be honest, I wouldn't like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, quote Dalton RIA News.
All I can say is that Dimitri Balmin will be able to meet his obligations - that I have no doubt about.
On the team, he enjoys great authority, and this young expert certainly awaits a great future.
The Yuventus protector Leonardo Bonucci won't help the team in Italy's closest match with the Parma.
According to Football Italia, Coach decided not to include him in the game application to protect him in front of the 4th tour of the World Champion League Group Round.
Nor will they take part in a fight with the "Parma" of Lichtsteiner, Vučinić and Pepe.
And Fabio Kvallarella's forward recovered from his injury and was ready to play.
The cost of fuel will be offset by a tax manoeuvre that increases the mineral tax (NIR) on oil at the same time as export duties are reduced and excises are increased.
According to experts, these measures could add an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyarsk Court was abducted by a permit hitting him in the head.
The unsubs attacked the President of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, Vladimir Dvoekonko, stealing his identity card.
According to Interfax, late Wednesday night, the intruders hit the judge in the head, causing him to faint.
When the 63-year-old president of the court recovered, he found out that he had been removed from his service card.
Money and other values have not been taken by criminals.
The two-pointer made his own way home, and the police only went to the police the next day.
We're investigating the crime and looking for the criminals.

U.S. Secretary of State: Special Services sometimes "go too far" in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and wiretapping, US intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far," but the politician pointed out that the media's information about the wiretap of 70 million people was not true.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but the attempt to gather information has been.
Yes, in some cases this has gone too far and has been unlawful.
I admit it, as the President has acknowledged... and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future," quoted Secretary of State AFP.
Italian workers with years of experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment beats the record.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population were now unemployed.
This has not been so bad since World War II.
This figure is several times higher among young people.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15-24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and the laws that have been passed allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for employees with seniority.
On the other hand, Italy is awaiting a common European problem of an ageing population.
And economists aren't sure that the premature rotation of personnel is gonna work.
What the construction of a TPU in Moscow will lead to
Every year, the capital authorities promise to establish an increasing number of transport and transplant hubs (TPUs).
It is planned to put into operation 255 TPUs by 2020.
What the project actually turns out to be, it was our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was established on the Smolenskaya subway of the Arbatsk-Pocrovsky line.
The inscription stated that the transport and transplant node was in the process of being installed.
All of this was very strange, as no land transport stops near Smallen and therefore cannot be moved to Smolen.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cross about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Pocket's alley.
Smolen's almost done now.
The flower lair disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by a bruschat in front of the entrance.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transplant nodes are flat and capital, as explained in the press service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There aren't any capital TVs yet.
And the flats involve building parking spaces, removing commercial facilities that hinder the movement of passengers, creating small architectural forms and upgrading.
As a matter of fact, it is not the transporters who are even involved in flattery, but the professional welfare workers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, " explains Michael Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes there's enough roofs over your head and a tab that alerts you to the time of arrival.
For example, the Yasenevo subway has recently discovered a fully fledged flat node.
No curtains, but with the parking stops and the signboards pointing out when the bus comes.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials record everything in the TVP.
As early as 2011, the mayor's office planned to build all 151 knots, of which 59 were built.
Now there are 255 TPUs in the plans until 2020.
One and a half of them are promised to surrender this year.
Although the city has a programme for the development of the TPP, no qualitative criteria have been identified, " states Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization City and Transport.
They report on the number of facilities, but the quality of transplants in each of them often deteriorates.
In the expert ' s view, there should be two criteria: first, reduced transplant time, second, convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, however, the TPUs sometimes go exactly the opposite way.
A vivid example of the VDDH subway.
Previously, suburban buses on the Jaroslav highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the IVC.
Now the stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka on Cosmonaut Street.
From the subway, far further from the monorails, but closer to the homes.
It was a gift that the residents didn't want the bus station under the windows at all and complained to all possible authorities.
The capital TVs in Moscow didn't work out right away.
The first one started building five years ago on the planetary subway.
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And really, there's a pattern of how a transplant node that's paid off to investors turns into a banal mall.
No, there's bus farts, a curtain to keep the subway out of the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the Chimkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow's TUP were not given a seat in principle.
They're like strangers being moved away from the subway.
But there's more room for trade.
32 stores alone, and almost everything from zoos to auto salon.
Actually, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the road?
We always get a mall when we build a capital TV, for some reason.
The situation had recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot had decided to be placed on the market.
Now on the third floor of the "Planner" TPU, there is a staggered trade among the semi-park spaces.
The vegetables, the spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-Russian speech, and the guards looking at our photographer in an evil way.
The transplant node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the planetary subway used to have a market, but it was knocked down.
And in the prefecture, the merchants felt sorry for them and let the transplant node in the intercept parking lot.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was blown down to build a new flattery.
It's like a rock.
The subway "Kaluzskaya's " approach from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 meters, " says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the mall, it is alleged that the distance has increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to go out in the open.
However, the structures on Plannernaya and Kaluzska will soon appear to be flowering.
In mid-September, the Town and Land Commission of the City approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPPs.
Four of them will be 25-story, except for two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow at the Tucino subway, with 418,700 square metres of land.
The representatives of the RZhD railway station management responsible for the construction of the TPP at the subway have already told the journalists that there will be shops, hotels and apartments in the future.
At the same time, officials are assured that multi-tiered parking areas are mut from one third to one half of the square.
Let's take "people's" garages for example.
Let's say that the 258-seat garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So for a 2,600 car parking, Petrovsko-Razumovsky will need about 80,000 "quadrants."
That's less than a third of the machina they're gonna build there.
Let one or two floors go on some bus farts.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate left.
And this, for a minute, is almost two Gumas.
If station and station power plants are built by railway personnel, the rest of the sites will be developed by subwaymen.
They also promised that there would be many "functional targets," including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow Property Department recently told journalists that it was drafting a regulation that would allow investors to apply directly to officials for a TPP site.
No contests of any kind.
Because transport matters are a priority for the city.
The perfect TPU is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or Spaina in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams go down to the subway level and the distance from the subway wagon to the tram is only 50 metres without going out.
There's no extra trade around here.
But Moscow's officials throw themselves to extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we kill 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate extremism with an insult to patriotic feelings.
In order to legally protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "The Just Russia" proposes to equate an insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to punish it for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Izvestia, such legislative amendments prepared by Oleg Miheev, Deputy Head of the Thought Committee on Energy, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government for an opinion.
By the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with a country of which he is a citizen, a country of love, a responsible attitude towards her fate, respect for her history and culture.
According to Mikheev, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of the official features of State authority - the flag and the emblem.
However, according to a parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be hurt and insulted by State symbols and other expressions of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
As an example, on the eve of the Victory Day of Discussion each year, some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the struggle against fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - the Victory Day of May 9 - a real vacchanalia is set up every year.
While exercising wit and "alternal view" of history, some publicists have come to reason that it is a pity that the cultural Germans have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I find this totally unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiringly strong" nation - Oleg Miheev is outraged.
Moreover, according to Micah, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but the law punishes insults to the feelings of believers, and insults to patriotic feelings can be done almost with impunity.
According to the popular elector, it is necessary to equate an insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate punishment in 282nd article of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for insults to patriotic feelings ranging from a hundred thousand to five years ' imprisonment.
The 6.6 magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the area of the city of Cokimbo in central Chile, and is being transmitted by Reuters.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as explained on the website of the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
Pushes were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
No casualties or destruction caused by underground shocks have yet been reported.
Let us recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying intensity are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the 8.8 earthquake and the resulting tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile had the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, 9.5 magnetud was recorded.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of the disaster.
Dmitri Medvedev: The Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict compliance with Russian legislation.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in compliance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee respect for the law," said Dmitri Medvedev in a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanne, like the rest of the activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quoted Mr. Ero's RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, nor can anyone violate the law," Dimitri Medvedev in turn stated.
He said that any structures that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, were dangerous.
He stressed that these facilities were "as a powder barrel" and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico and transmitted to RIA News.
The UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of tasks to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats had played a key role in advancing the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs that were due to expire in 2015 before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which had begun in Rio de Janeiro the previous night.
They were included in the outcome document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit the previous night that it was time to "get above national interests."
"I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and oversee the process of creating universal sustainable development goals - SDGs," he said.
These MDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of powerful people
Under the statue of Zamora Machel, the founding President of Mozambique, staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed the business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Independence Capital Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo - one of the most brutal clashes since the truce over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era, as part of its efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the truce of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo's ruling party, a leading political power since 1975, and Renamo's party accuses each other of creating tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has become the source of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sophala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, reporting to the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "all that remained of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased following the report that Mazanga had declared Renamo ' s rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times what he meant by non-compliance with the Frelimo party.
"Our goal is to get back to negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful men (Gebuza and Dhlakama) facing the foreheads," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by a weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Movimiento Democrático Movimiento Movimiento Movimiento Movimiento Movimiento Movimiento Movimiento Democrática (MDM), which was founded by former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to resign next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear how Renamo is able to do so, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sophala, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted "to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want a return to peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
The Art-Mainstream premiere series will be held in Moscow
The Art-Mainstream Film Series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place at the Rolan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA News with reference to the project's organizers.
The French comedy of director and actress Reim Kerichi, "Paris at all costs," will open the Art-Mainstream program.
This is the story of the French model of Maye (Sama Kerichi), who is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also see a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duke "Mebius," Oliver Hirschbiegel's melodramatic bike "Diana: Love Story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Life Adele" by Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian member of Art-Mainstrom will be the winner of Alexander Veledinsky's film "Geograph Globos Propagated" at the Kinotaurus Festival on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's identical novel.
Constantine Habensky, whose work was also marked by the "Kinotara" prize, played a leading role in the film - the charming loser of Victor Mothkin's teacher.
Children should study myths and legends as "life models," says the author.
Words about the Torah could show that "brutal power cannot defeat sophisticated cunning," and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
By saying that many myths will prove "to be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools," Crossley Holland advocates "the careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklors are already part of education," he said.
I was in favour of introducing them into the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the "excessive morality" of authors and teachers "rejects interest" from children, and the basic ideas "supplicated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon, and also wrote "The Collection of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin and "British People's Fairytales," said, "You may have intentions, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there must be a congenital understanding of good and evil.
And it has to be sublimated; it's revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In Voronezh region, a football fan was arrested breaking a window in the waiting room of the station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, two football fans, native of Moscow province, were removed by transport police officers from the passenger train at the Gryazi-Voronezh station.
On their way to the game of a favorite team, the guys on the way made a drunken debuff on the train.
The young men were taken to the duty station of the line police station at the Gruzi station to draft a report on an administrative offence.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police made administrative material on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets to the next train and at the station station were waiting for his arrival.
At half the first night, the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and his foot smashed the front door window in the station waiting room.
A traffic police officer and the security guard of the RZD were running at the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend the intruder who was trying to escape from the scene.
Members of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation are conducting an inspection.
The question of the initiation of criminal proceedings is raised, and the senior referee for the transmission of information and public relations of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in transport operations, Sergei Olhovik, reported.
Vitaly Mutko: Watersheds?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, gave his opinion on the riots on the stands during the "Spartacus" Russian Cup match.
I'm in favour of being held accountable by the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, Russian Federation.
But we can see they've taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone to come outside and clean up.
It's a very good position, but it's not quite right.
You have to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, not let things go.
We have now drawn up a special government regulation on stadium conduct.
Once it's adopted, we'll take care of it.
But I'm still gonna invite all the football organizers.
I read the interview with Leonid Fedoun.
State, please, hurry up with the law.
It's like the Bavaria fans came to Yaroslavl and they all did it.
And we're outside observers.
It's awful to see the stand watered with firewalls.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10 to 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia
An ex-American intelligence officer, Edward Snowden, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify on phone-tapping cases by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from representatives of the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he would lose refugee status and could be granted to Washington by the United States allies," said the agency's interviewer.
"In principle, however, the Attorney General's Office of the Federal Republic of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Former German Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify in the case of the U.S. Special Forces ' wiretapping of the German Chancellor ' s talks.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German territory.
The CIA ex-boyfriend made it clear that he knows a lot.
Although the U.S. NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions for his arrival, " told Strebela to Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the Interfax source, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but that when and how - he would decide.
A U.S. citizen, Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about secret surveillance operations on the Internet by U.S. intelligence agencies.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been revoked by the United States authorities, who had charged him in absentia, and remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum on Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sheremetyevo the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, stated that his client was employed by a "large Russian company."
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported to the German media.
According to journalists, the Chancellor ' s telephone calls started listening as early as 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing the information, claimed that Merkel's surveillance violated Germany's laws and sovereignty.
Ponomarev has left the "Just Russia"
A member of the State Duma from the "Just Russia" party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he filed an application with the party ' s New Siberian Regional Office.
According to its statutes, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "fairwealths."
We sit, we drink tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture of "Ilya Ponomarev puts on the table a party, but there's nothing so epochal about it," commented the MP on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional Eser office.
However, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not legally withdraw from it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the "Just Russia" party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitri Goodkov and Valery Zubov would leave the S.R. with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fumio Kisid, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"Would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," said Kisid at the meeting.
The Foreign Minister of Japan recalled that since Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries have become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan in dealing with complex political issues, writing to RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the disputed Nordic territories.
To that end, protests are taking place today in Tokyo to demand that the land lost after the Second World War be restored to the country.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars that say, "Return the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they make sure they don't exceed the noise level.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, an estrada artist, Frank Faye, who worked at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's novel was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York comedy festival.
Created and sponsored by Caroline Hersch, founder of Caroline's stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"The majority of these hedliners started in Carolines and then made more success, reached the level of being too famous to perform at the club," said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as "Stendap for heroes," an annual comedy concert for war veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example through a show on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous for his role in a comedy show on a little-known cable channel (a FXX Feng League scaffold) and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slat joined both the Saturday Night Live and the Parks and Rest Areas, although she is best known for a series of viral videos called "Marseille - A Seashell in Shoes."
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own style (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jesellick, evil, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in cinema, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
"This town is definitely the centerpiece of all Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked around somewhere between the two houses and he thought, "Here, if I don't have any money at all, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country in the United Kingdom, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of Pakistan ' s relations with India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun," stated the statement of the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed for dialogue to work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," the diplomats added.
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same Afghan movement, but operate independently of it in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
Previously, the Islamabad Government had attempted to enter into negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities removed troops stationed in the Taliban areas to permanent locations and released the Islamists arrested.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large stocks were overshadowed by a message showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
The U.S. standard oil in the December shipment was reduced by 14 cents, at a price of $96.24 per barrel for a later morning European time in electronic bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which was a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
On Wednesday, the Department of Energy announced that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been added to the stock.
But on Friday there was a sign of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of the Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery can continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, also used by United States refineries, was 26 cents lower than $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Patrick Rua, the chief coach of Colorado, explained the decision to release Holkiper Semen Varlamov from the first minute in a Friday match with Dallas, and expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars had not shaken his confidence in the Russian, was transmitting from Dallas the "SE" by Natalia Shmeleva.
And what do we wait for, Rua said after the morning of Lavin?
Of course, what has happened is bothering us all, but we are sure of it, and we feel that it will be beneficial for him to go out on ice today.
We want him to go on ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation hasn't affected the goalkeeper's condiments?
We'll see today.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in the previous games of this season.
The point is, no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until this situation is resolved by the court.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be vegan: warm tomato will not replace soup.
Why vegetarianism isn't suitable for life in Siberia, finding out RIA News correspondent.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here, they can't survive the winter without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, as the New Siberian dietists and doctors interviewed on the eve of vegan day.
Drink oil with litres
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia such strict nutritional standards are, at the very least, not healthy.
Total rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for.
At least milk or eggs must be included in the diet," I'm sure a nutritionist, Marina Bogay.
She gives an example of fish containing the indispensable fatty acid Omega-3.
Its richest vegetable oil is linen.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you must drink it with liters," says the nutritionist.
The medical staff are convinced that the people of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly questioned.
In the face of our realities, there is a high demand for food.
It takes increased calories to keep it warm.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, accordingly, he does not collect this calorie," says the expert.
Olga Poznyak, the dietist doctor, agrees.
She adds that vegetables and fruits aren't the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly food that is grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is geared towards better learning and digesting these products.
And in the winter, people want not a cucumber, but a hot soup or something," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, various grains, croups, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But it's certainly not enough for a full meal.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the levels of vitamins in sybirians are only sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our strict natural environment, where temperatures can change by 30 degrees per day and snow in May, is not appropriate.
The body needs energy for its life, and this is, above all, fat," says a medic.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Kids are growing up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And with vegetarianism, we give them to the imperfect.
Pregnant women also need increased protein, vitamins and micronutrients on the menu.
"The vegans don't get 'em," I'm sure God.
Arifulina says a grown man is free to choose whatever he wants to "play the toys he wants."
He's got a developed organism, a skeleton, organs.
And the children still have to eat fully.
If parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids by choosing for him what he eats, it's just a violation of the child's rights.
"A lack of substance for brain development, vision, bones can't be repaired tomorrow," she says.
All medical experts interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-growing greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is also being brought to us in greenhouses contains fewer micronutrients than what is being produced in the open ground.
"The quality of the food is wrong," says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more yields is detrimental to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, tomatoes tasteless and non-aromat," gives examples of medics, adding that they are likely to be filled with excessive fertilizer.
And they're not suppliers of vitamins, they're fibers.
Vera Petruk, a candidate for agricultural science, disagrees with this in the laboratory of the Siberian Physics and Technology Institute for Agrarian Problems.
She said that with the right approach and compliance with all the standards and requirements in greenhouses, it was possible to grow full vegetables.
If you try to get more out of a square metre, of course, water will become more frequent, and the plants will be overfed with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large but watery and unsavory," she explains, adding that quality depends primarily on the producer's conscience.
Court suspended the enforcement of the "stop-and-search" decision in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's "stop-and-search" programme and suspended the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution in the manner in which it had carried out a programme of street detention and interrogation.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and orders for corrective measures, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police force change its work practices and related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on the motion for adjournment.
The Court of Appeal argued that the judge should be challenged because she violated the U.S. code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements publicly responding to the court ' s criticism.
The judge ruled that the police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unduly approaching blacks and Latin Americans under the stop-and-search programme.
It appointed an external supervisor to oversee major changes, which include policy, training and control reforms, and also decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras in police stations where most detentions take place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases had been dropped after police screening.
The town ' s appeal debate is due after 14 March 2014.
The "stop and search" tactics were criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The "stop-search" has been practised for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor, Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of changes in the New York Police Department's stop-and-search programme say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a stronger and more effective police service and may affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morale rather than criminality, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions by reducing the number of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not ceased the practice of "stop-and-search," which was constitutionally consistent, but was changing the way the New York police stopped people.
In the area of the Triakov Gallery, a pedestrian zone was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Triakov Gallery and occupies a section two kilometres from the Novookuznetskaya subway station to Bolotna Square.
Street torchers, flowers, benches, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been installed all along.
In addition to the Klimentsky and Lavrushyn alleys, which were already footpaths, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordinsk impasse, the Greater and Small Tolmachevan alleys, the Kadashevsk coast and the Bolotny Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the section of Friday Street, from the Novokuznetskaya station lobby to the Klementov alley, conditions for pedestrians have been created without the removal and cutting of the carriageway, and transmits newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Triakov Gallery, the Church of the Holy Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other sites.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the Straw Towers, and the Kuznetsk Bridge Street were completely pedestrianized.
The Great Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, decided to close the area for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hack to check on a confidential message.
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clarke's novel, who was then Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Queen ' s Counsel, Andrew Edice, informed the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World received false news that Clarke was meeting with her "attractive special adviser," Hanna Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkayre to hack Polby's voicemail and tucked her in at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, and heard the court.
"The prosecution thinks that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand near someone's house hoping to surprise someone, he's a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edice.
He said that News of the World had used three ways of investigating stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking phones?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The rumors about Clark's novel drew attention for the first time to News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voice-mail tape received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkir's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as "Projects."
During the period of surveillance, Ms. Polby ' s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information about her, said Mr. Edice.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weatherap controlled the surveillance of Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're planning to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edice said that Coulson's involvement in the story was similar to that of other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson was in confrontation with Mr. Blanket about an affair with a married woman while he was in contact with Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with other people to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkir, Turlbeck and Weatherap confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden is willing to speak with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany on the wiretapping case.
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, stands ready to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and to meet with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, handing over RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday presented a message to the German authorities by the deputy of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Strebele.
Strebele met Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured in the Tver Street fire
Four passers-bys were injured in a fire in a sewer in the centre of Moscow, Tver Street.
According to Interfax, with reference to the source in the emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by was injured during a fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA News, with reference to Paul Livinsky, head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, electricity is now fully restored in all houses on Tver Street.
The fire in the heat reservoir near house 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
Heavy smoke came from the storm drain hatches, and smoke was produced at the underground crossing located at the Armenian store.
The fire destroyed 11 houses on Tver Street.
At 9:45 a.m. Moscow time, the fire was destroyed.
The US is cutting food aid for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial supply of food stamps, known as "foodstamps," has been declining as the government programme ends.
The four-person family food allowance will now receive $36 per month less than previously spoken by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the average benefit per person was $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the US rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid, which is given by the foodstamps, which has been named since they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress demand further cuts in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food shopkeepers across America are worried that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform free of charge
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform free of charge on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamers note that at present only users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
The game is also not yet available to Russian users.
As media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC does not appear to be different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, dark ruler Sarlack decided to kill bright king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlarosa Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlack's cronies and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
Prior to that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
New machines will appear in the Moscow subway.
But selling tickets to passengers isn't for money, it's for sitting down.
One 30-rouble trip will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by means of modern technology, reporting to ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at the exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new tickets, the Russian Olympic Committee president Alexander Zhukov and the Olympic champions of the Gymnast Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamoldchikov will take part.
The National Security Agency ' s admissions reinforce the paranoia of corporations with regard to State surveillance
In late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV hoped to find antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. National Intelligence Director, again assured in September that the US was not using foreign intelligence "to steal commercial secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of US companies to improve their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a exposer, began to publish his US intelligence treasurer, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised corporate paranoia caused by government surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone might have been bugged for about ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can be targeted, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies is evident.
I think it's likely that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Grune, president of BITMI, who represents a small and medium-sized IT company in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the US now represents almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
All of Mr. Snowden ' s documents, however, have yet to show that the US has transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Policymakers expressed concern that the EU lacked some information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software supplier SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
And yet, the reach and technical development of US spy agencies, known by Snowden's revelations, has been a shock to some companies that used to think China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European company leaders have better understood that data stored in the US are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of a US-based cloud service provider after exposing the US programme for the intellectual analysis of Prism data.
Jim Sneeb, one of the SAP's executive directors, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that recent reports are merely proof of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What's going on is economic espionage, no wonder.
It's always happened.
"It has been a subject of discussion for years and has not changed significantly in the current debate," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we're spying on them too, because it's in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the response they have taken, as this may give the enemy an advantage.
Large companies have long learned the idea that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least careless.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi automobiles, says that for many years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones while travelling abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then dumped.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
"Little and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," warns BfV.
The US is alerting its own companies to economic espionage from other countries.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Report placed France, together with Russia and Israel, in a second series of economic intelligence hackers, after China, claiming the Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly stated in an interview this month: "The service knows perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who died by "funny accident" believe that their son was murdered.
The parents of a teenage boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a folded sports mat in his high school gym believe that their son was murdered, stated a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdost, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical, standing mat at the back of the stands in the sports hall of his high school.
Investigators of the Loundes County Sheriff's Department concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy contests this.
"They're pretty sure their son was murdered," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Krump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says he did.
"They think it's against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they brought him back in a body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they bring them.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I take the view that there are sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
"There are a few questions that should be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The sheriff's representative of Loundez County was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
The South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to publish all the surveillance video footage that the investigators were looking at.
The adolescent's parents said they were hoping that the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about persons who put up a fascist symbol
On the official Spartacus website, the Moscow Club announced the appearance of a fascist flag on the rostrum in Jaroslavla.
"At the Shinnik-Spartacus Cup on 30 October, unknown provocations at the Yaroslavla stadium showed a fascist symbolism.
All those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence are requested to do so.
"Payment is guaranteed," stated the statement.
Looking for fans who put up a fascist flag in Yaroslavla
We will recall that in the 1/16 match of the Russian Cup final, Shinnik - Spartacus was interrupted several times due to riots in the stands.
A fascist symbolism was also shown in Spartacus' party sector.
As a punishment, Spartacus can perform about three games without the audience.
The Committee will meet on Friday.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations to schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service providers of the food allergies of children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep stocks of adrenaline, most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen automatic medical syringe, to help with potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergic reactions.
Kids can say, "It feels like something's sticking in my tongue," "It feels like I have hair in my tongue," or "Language stings."
Parents of intersex children can choose "undefined sex"
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to refer to any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate sex as "undefined" or "undefined" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who may make hasty decisions about the sex appropriation of newborns and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to BBC, said years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna be a doctor-created shredded article with bruises and scars.
About one of the 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of the approximately 60 pathological states that are diagnosed as "sexual development disorders" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (eggs or semens) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallace Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use and appropriate all available information than to wait for and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children don't have them," he said.
You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their condition was not gender related, but rather their biological structure, which was not exclusively male or female but was typical of both at the same time or not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sex topics such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast and body composition; primary sex topics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, brutality and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norrie May-Walby, became the world's first person to be declared "sexless," claiming the right to retain "undefined" sexual status for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third symbol in addition to M and F-X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American web site Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to Baby Zone that she would prefer to have children set up sex at birth.
"It's hard enough to raise a child without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said to the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites - a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw gender as a leaf that could be erased and then painted again.
But now many are challenging ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how a child will perceive the sex he is given when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called an emergency psychiatric case," said Drescher.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to deal with children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental signals, including social signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with the child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a careless circumcision, to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful transition, but it wasn't," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still "applying this model" right now.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves "unsatisfied results."
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but with intermediate genitals.
The doctors couldn't tell if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external sexual organs and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned a vaginoplasty.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Learning the truth, he became a man again, getting shots of testosterone and removing his chest.
The surgery made him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to get the perception of people with intersexuality into normality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, the executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law is "incentived to branding and stigma."
"A lot of activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child "undefined sex," she said.
We're afraid he'll facilitate intervention.
We think it's best to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Thamar Mattis said that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose the third sex."
"Growers should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she says.
German law implies its attribution at birth.
This is a battle that small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law "will support" both parents and children.
The daughter of Baraz, Kathy, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called "total insensitive to androgens."
Since her androg receptors aren't working properly, Katie has developed a woman's profile.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is married and is a resident in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hoped to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own," Baraz said.
He's giving them time to do some tests and sort things out, as well as a period before they write "man" or "women's."
In that case, you're fine - raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that drives parents because they don't feel that they're doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with - and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Chikago's goalkeeper, Nikolai Habibulin, stressed that he understood that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two Hawks meetings, Habiboulin first missed six pikes from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced by a fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I failed to do so, which brings CSNChicago to Habibulin's words.
- I've got to find confidence in practice, I think we should treat them like games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are some small components that I need to improve, but I feel quite decent at practice.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Vratari - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not happy.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many pikes.
It's great that my one-clubs support it, but basically it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games aren't all season, but I wanted to do them a lot better.
But what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'm just gonna try to play the next game better.
There's a flight bus on Altai.
In the Rubtsov district of the Altai region, a PAZ flight bus was turned over.
As a result of the accident, 13 persons were reported to the MES Regional Office as having been affected by the accident.
The region ' s law enforcement authorities had previously reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vishnevka road, 1 kilometre from Novonikolaevka.
A bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka contained 12 passengers and a driver, all of whom suffered injuries of varying degrees and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1 and two were hospitalized in Rubtsovsk CRS.
Bearev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be shipped to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 to be shipped to Europe once the markets of Latin America and Asia are established.
"We expect a total of more than 170 copies of this type of aircraft," quoted Interfax from Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that serious cooperation had been established with French counterparts, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and Asia-Pacific markets, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope it will be delivered to France someday," stressed the Russian prime minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the civil aircraft Suhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Lainer is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in a segment of 100 passenger seats.
The energy of Dnepropetroshchina has started a unique program to save... the nest of arists.
In the old days, in order to reach the court of the storks, the villagers on the high pole set a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest held well on it.
There are no such special pillars for a long time, so the storks have loved the poles of the power transmission lines - the interlocked branches rely on wires, making the aistic house safe.
Anya's grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky District, had been living in an Aistrian family for 20 years, began to notice the nest settling despite the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new rags on top, and the lower layer is already between the wires, and it's about to collapse.
Of course, it is pathetic to have a family of storks nesting by the pantry every year, taking out and feeding three or four chicks over the summer, but they don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edge, Anya's grandmother called the royal RPP, which belonged to the support.
I didn't even expect them to react so fast.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, " told the technical director of Dneproblenergo, Sergei Berezovsky.
The wires, which were actually already inside a nest weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began to be corroded.
At any moment, birds could have died of electric discharge.
And the locals risked losing light because of the wire damage.
So linear monsters started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University helped develop a nest transfer scheme.
They did training for district network staff.
The famous daypropetrovsky ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy specialists at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 Aistine apartments in the area in an emergency condition.
Special metal platforms similar to the crater were welded for reconstruction.
The base was splattered by the branches of the willows, and then carried there an old nest.
In the opinion of scholars, it is enough to lay down old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskov district.
A new iron concrete pole was placed near the electrical pole and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, a similar housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikov district, at the berm of Ani's grandmother.
This is where the platform was secured in the same place, but it was lifted above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "place" has been overhauled.
By the end of the year, four more nests in the Pobre and Czaric districts of Dnipropetráchnya are waiting for the same reconstruction.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them mercilessly.
On the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, the poachers shot and killed a swan family in the local pond for entertainment in the village of Ust Kamenka of the Apostol region.
The noble birds weren't afraid of people at all; the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now, officers of the Apostolic District Police Department are finding out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting popular.
On 4 November, People's Unity Day, Moscow will be held in coordination with the mayor's office of the Russian March.
According to the Levad Center survey, support for the Russian Marches is growing - 40 per cent of citizens have expressed varying degrees of support for them.
According to the Levada Center, 40 per cent of the citizens have different degrees of approval for the Russian marches: of these, 11 per cent are definitely positive and 29 per cent are "early positive."
The popularization of the "Russian Marches" is gradually increasing, with only 14 per cent of Russians having welcomed it in 2006 and twice as many citizens (28 per cent) having supported such events in December 2010.
"Definitely negative" is only 7% Russian, 19% more negative.
Another 35% were unable to formulate their views on this action.
This year, the City of Moscow agreed on a "Russian March" of up to 15,000 people in Lublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Majoorov.
This nationalist action has taken place every year on People ' s Unity Day since 2005.
When asked by sociologists, "Did you hear that "Russian marches" are being held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans of defending the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75 per cent) of citizens responded negatively.
Now only one in five Russians know about this action (20%).
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost one third of citizens (31%) were heard about the Russian Marches.
It will be recalled that three years ago, on 11 December, a spontaneous meeting of nationalists took place in Manezna Square, which turned into a riot.
Levada Center also asked the Russians about the celebration of 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (National Unity Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
However, only 15% of citizens meet to celebrate the holiday.
About the same amount (17%) will celebrate October 7th Revolution Day.
Most citizens (62%) do not intend to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the City Hall of Moscow agreed on the "Russian March" in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital agreed to hold the "Russian March" on 4 November in Lublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the march, Dmitri Demushkin.
In addition to the Lublino march, a rally and a rock concert of the "Colovrat" group will take place on People's Unity Day, also agreed upon with the authorities.
How did the Russian March 2012 go?
On People ' s Unity Day in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakiman coast to the Central House of the artist, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the figure as 6,000.
Communication: Obama's election headquarters was considering Biden's exclusion in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama ' s closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral roll.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all of Mark Halperin's and John Hailemann's anticipated books on the 2012 campaign, "Statches Doubled: The Game Changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the next of the President's associates had conducted "large-scale focus group research and opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether Bayden's exclusion could help raise the dying hopes of Obama's re-election.
According to the political columnist The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by high-ranking officials of the election headquarters and the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago Electoral Headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the President's closest advisers - including Daley, Obama's former campaign chief of staff, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Pluff - knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book Doubled claims that Daley was the proponent of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their "near personal relationship," but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not "improve Obama's chances substantially."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been actively advocating a lot of things, and it was one of them," said Daley to the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?"
Although Daley described the study as a "need to be tested," Martin told CNN's representative Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested quite a lot in examining whether that move would bring dividends to the vote.
"Pre-election headquarters don't spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously," said Martin in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of replacing him.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the possible fight.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president was "knowing" a possible replacement, the former chief of staff admitted that Obama knew "maybe."
Martin added that "The staves are doubled" did not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political sensing had reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the study on the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral roll.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Would you like some sunshine in the dark of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first dark ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the more it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company, "Lisney Me, I'm Tasty," says, "This is an incredible thing, but it's still in the early stages of production, so for £200, you'll get about two grams of substance."
The squirrel we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue under neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start glowing.
We've tested it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to imagine it on Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and the taste of cushy gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangarda Coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, referring to the preparation of his team for the regular CFL against Salawat, noted that the Omichi had conducted a thorough analysis of the Magnesogorian Metallurga injury.
The specialist stressed that the Avangarda should focus on the game of defense.
We watched a video game against the Magnetogorian Metallurga, citing an official website called "Avangard" by Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of pikes, not a very nice moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of their failure to perform a game assignment.
We knew the competition had artists.
According to the statistics, they've had five strokes on the move - three pucks beat us up.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparing for today's game?
Me and the guys, we go through every game carefully, talk after the game, prepare for a new rival.
The main thing is that the setup is done.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
It was a game assignment, and the score was 2:0.
We missed the goal in the locker room, and in the third period, we started to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in connecting the defenses.
We need to defend ourselves with the whole team.
Now the Avangard has a long home series, and the games go through the day, and the team's tired?
All commands are under the same conditions.
The important thing now is to make up for your moments and perform your game assignment.
Hockey is an emotional game if you're doing the setup, it's not that hard to decide.
Due to new regulations introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of furs have been waiting almost a week on the border with Russia.
Today, donetsk officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotuals.
Hundreds of furs gathered at border points when entering Russia.
This situation was caused by a change in the customs clearance regulations.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is creating a line that has not warned in advance of the innovations.
Since 28 October, Russian customs authorities have introduced additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, " reported Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Head of Eastern Customs.
The new model instrument is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Pass points are operating in high-speed mode.
The "FACTOV" correspondent visited the border and spoke to the truckers who were held hostage.
Prices at the road store cafe at the Novazovsk Pass are rising every day, as is the turn from the fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here, cargo is sent to Stavropol Province of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, and after introducing these rules, the trucker Alexi Golovanev complains (in a photo) who is carrying cargo through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are carried.
The minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 roubles (about 1,100 to 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who go near (say, Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and travel.
And the rest of us are stuck because no one has that much money with them!
Can you imagine if the driver's only carrying $4,000 worth of cargo, but in Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no, no - are complained of by truckers who eat near their cars.
Border stores and cafes are always expensive, but we've never seen a price like this anywhere!
The sellers were oriented and quickly wrinkled: 15 hryvnias worth a bahton, seven grivens worth a cup of coffee, and 25 grivens worth a plate of soup.
And the cafeteria is all alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the bathroom.
No washing, no shave...
I can stay out of my car for a week, my wife's ready for me.
For a week, another trucker, Victor Skotarenko, comforts himself.
Will my car get a turn in a week?
Why do you have one and a half litres of water?
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water fixed on the silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while there's something else, the salesgirl's paralyzing.
After media coverage, the plight of Ukrainian drivers was brought to the attention of the authorities in the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoazova Raydate have been instructed to provide drinking water to all those waiting in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Obgorate Administration, Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are now on call at the crossing points.
Biotuals will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the issue of lines will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of Donetsk Oblgosad, as at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles had been parked at the international Uspenka and Novoazovsk crossing points, respectively.
"FACTS" will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian President.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries, a statement made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information on this is available on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "speak" to the President of Lithuania, Dal Grybauskaitė, and publish false documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchy, which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to intelligence services, the preparation of an information attack is carried out by the Department of Analysis of the Public Procedures of the Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania on several occasions and took part in the convention of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A member of the department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives undercover until the end of 2012.
Smirnov is now prohibited from entering the country.
The day before, President Gribauskait of Lithuania announced that she was aware of the information that was being prepared for her.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and "the country's desire for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader had previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities on several occasions.
Thus, she claimed that Lithuania was "not well respected" in the Kremlin.
In addition, Gribauskaite accused Russian head Vladimir Putin of submitting "one claim only" to Lithuania.
In September, Rosbradzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It has been reported that the quality of products does not meet health and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, his Government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the U.S., a school principal fired on teenagers.
The principals of one of the American high schools were literally desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies threw toilet paper at a man's house.
As a result, a 15-year-old boy was shot in the leg and arm by the principal of the school.
Since the hooligans were not in the director ' s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail at $125,000.
Note that shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest, California, right across the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Previously, at Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam's mother worked at school, she was a teacher.
Shots fired at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a crook.
I haven't called in for candy distribution in my apartment in the last two years, and I'm probably not gonna do it this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow about Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans - 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women are no longer required to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're gonna see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daft Punk astronauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most commonly sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on animal costumes.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't change anything.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, candy, Milk Duds, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for 41 million children in need of candy who are preparing to conquer our neighborhood.
Moreover, we will buy and - and we will not deceive ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn grains; yet, according to the National Association of pastries, almost 35 million pounds are sold for Halloween.
That's about 9 billion separate corn grains.
It's a mystery I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses Halloween as much as haunted houses.
They have amazing names, such as Terrible Behind the Walls (which, by the way, is in a real prison), War and Shout House.
Moreover, according to the American Haunt Society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing pictures where you almost peed, which your friend put on Facebook, and you can't clean, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "a great face expression."
And we'll talk about pumpkins in the end.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Luckily for us, baby fashion in the pumpkin only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million this year on pumpkins.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which raised 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more complicated assignments, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their 2032-pound pumpkin.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence site was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers.
The website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia was restored after the morning cyber attack, and the press service of the agency reports.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defence for Information and Administration, Tymar Petercop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overburdened with a large number of requests.
Our experts quickly set up the site, and to date the site has been restored.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Petercop, Postimees.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent such incidents," he acknowledged.
On 1 November, Anonymous Ukraine posted a message in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO servants.
The Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous's statement.
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine previously reported that the company of the Marines of Theodosian, a separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines, would participate in the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 command-and-staff exercises.
Owing to the brutality of impure force, several schools and the hospital had to be closed down
Four schools in Zimbabwe province of South Matabelelland had to be closed because of students being attacked by... goblins.
According to a local elder, the children were panicked, and it was impossible to continue.
The story of goblins may sound like a fantasy for a European child, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed down in Zimbabwe because medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Land Rover racing announcement
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, you can obtain upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "Rally members applying to Bowler have changed."
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for unrest, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of Rally-Ride.
We were very pleased to develop the Defense Challenge car - it's going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russians don't know anything about the "Brother Circle" - New Izvestia.
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After media reports of Leps being placed on the control lists by the U.S. Treasury Department on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brother Circle', we looked at all the databases, but we didn't find such a group," said the agency's interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written by "Ni," yesterday the US Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the gang "Brother Circle."
The Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named among them.
He's on the list as Grisha, posted the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian artist.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, a creative alias, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five others mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another citizen from the former USSR whose citizenship is not specified.
In the U.S., I'm sure Grigory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was carrying money for the thugs on their orders.
A photograph of the singer is attached to this report and all his data are given which correspond to the reality.
In fact, Leps actually just bought a house on Phuket.
The agency indicated that it intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Placing a person on the U.S. Minfin's blacklists results in freezing his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with persons residing in the United States.
Leps Maya Serikov's assistant stated that there was no notification of the singer: "It's hard to answer the question whether this is the Grigory that everyone is talking about in connection with the US scandal."
All Leps knows is media information.
He was not officially notified in person, although I don't know if they exist in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all funny, on the one hand, and on the other, it's amazing and unexpected," she said RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps doesn't live on Phuket, but according to the U.S. Ministry of Finance, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught him travelling to the city of Blagoveschensk.
Runnin' out on the field at the Shinnick match.
Some details of the identity of the fan who ran on the field during the 1/16 Russian Cup Finals match between the Yaroslav "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartacus" became known.
According to the head of the CDC of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigorianz, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the cheerleader is a Moscowman.
He's in custody at the moment.
"In addition to this, Grigoryantz described how the fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, called a spectator, went to the ambulance, accompanied by two viewers, citing heart problems.
He came to the E.R., which was confirmed by the E.R.
And then he pushed the two chaperones away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran across the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Until the Sports Act comes into force, it's a flight attendant's area of operation - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, climbed through the East rostrum.
And during this time, riots began on the East rostrum and on the runways," said the head of the KDC.
Let us recall that, by decision of the KDC, the Moscow Spartacus will conduct the upcoming 15th tournament of Russia against Lockomotiva and Zenita and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.
The fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous concession in his career.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran away after she got into a small accident.
Three days later, a man walking a dog noticed her stuck in a career.
Firefighters came down on a rope on a slippery slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after fire brigades were called to lift it up and get it to safety after it was somehow stuck 50 feet high on a dangerous fall of the suspension slope.
The nine-month coker-spaniel Ruby escaped after she had a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her masters, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flapper's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and posting messages on social media sites after she ran off to her career after a minor accident.
At about 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a bright dog driver noticed that Ruby was stuck at a height of 50 feet at the bottom of his career.
The technical rescue team from the Clechiton fire station hurried to the scene, went down the ropes to save Ruby, and used the transport to lift her up the slope.
The specialist officer of the rescue squad Andy Clayton said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a hanging slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she completely froze.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist officer in the rescue team, said, "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and she was found to be all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "The observation of salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got it back in our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she'd lost strength and fainted, she'd probably fall.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave - what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a back singer for a 2004 Jagger song, Old habits die hard.
Perry said she was having dinner with a rocker vet, and she said, "He was flirting with me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of a 70-year-old Jagger said that he "really denies that he ever hit Katie Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was among the artists who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: The breakup with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another scarecrow about independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along Adrianov's berm.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movements across the rest of Europe, although - predictablely - this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has it been pointed out that EU member countries spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in the way they are comfortable with it.
Since Scotland is no longer part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels to replace what he really wanted from the Scottish people.
So it's an unworthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil, for the first time, I heard a duck saying that "independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
And yet, there's an interesting moment lost in the old story's jump.
Why should an independent Scotland comply with Europe's orders?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels's yoke, especially now?
Here's real European news: Europe's great post-war plan to unite is finally stalled.
With the Eurocrisis, the Europa project is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or in favour of the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic party "Alternative for Germany," founded only this year, came out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively replacing "Free Democrats" (a similar to our "liberal Democrats") from the Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are operating with excessive fiscal deficits - this has been true only for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members for exchange rates that benefit German exporters - which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a pre-existing disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only way to save is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and the currency is the deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels - a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's paralysingly unfavourable price conditions, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
No freeze on wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of US cheap shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a mutiny, especially in France, once the strongest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way of controlling Germany and putting Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France's destroyed economy in distress.
The result is the right-wing opposition of Marin Le Pen's "National Front" party to the EU has just won decisive by-elections by placing the ruling Socialist party in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that the split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If - and this is very likely - anti-EU parties get support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my view: soon, growing feelings against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague "Europeans (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I'm guessing that Britain is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get close to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain is likely to be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
What position does that leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland can succeed within a more freer European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party ' s government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which gained an impressive majority of votes in 2011 because of objections to the cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent coalition of Tori and liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence now only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturation: early ageing
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obesity may be one of the trigger mechanisms for early sexual maturation
The trend towards early sexual maturity is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop breasts and grow pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, a child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and constitute a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents - it doesn't usually mean full sexual maturity," said Kaplovitz.
Visible signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breast begins to develop, at least two to three years pass before the menarche," said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Greeding in Girls: How to deal with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how sexuality progresses.
There is a debate on what constitutes the actual onset of sexual maturity, but is considered "preliminary" when the increase in the breast is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or suspend - that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster advancement may be the basis for endocrinology analyses to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature ageing of bones, which can eventually lead to slower growth and low growth at maturity.
The recommendations on medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The caplovitz is careful with medication, but acknowledges that "abduction of sexuality can mitigate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from those of their peers."
Another big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can handle hygiene," said Kaplovitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are a lot of popular theories about the causes of early adulthood.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
Boys - like girls - have early sexual maturation.
Kaplovitz claims that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, it helped to conduct a study of girls aged between 6 and 9 years, which links the amount of fat in the body to maturity.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Throughout the world, everything, from economic conditions and climates to genes, seems to affect early sexual maturation.
The mystery is that, although boys have hair on their faces and on their pubic heads at a younger age, the trend towards full early sexual maturity is less pronounced than girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair occurs even in infants and ascension children.
"We must be careful how we define the true onset of sexual maturity," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It could mean an earlier than expected conversation," explained Kaplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who flourish early need proof that, even when this is done earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing, stuck in Chita, is preparing for flight.
An American aircraft flying under the Treaty on Open Skies over Russian territory and landing on Wednesday in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8.30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city ' s air harbour.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take the fuel money.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Ude.
According to other data, he's going to the U.S.
The plane reportedly landed in the Zabaykali province in Ulan Ude due to fog.
He was not released from Chita Airport because of unpaid bills.
There are 30 persons on board, including a crew, who spent two nights inside the airport, reporting to ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board aircraft are not allowed to go outside the Chita airport, but can pass border control only at two Russian airports, in Kubinka and in Ulan Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 with 34 States parties.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements and enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capacities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities make? - MK in the U.S.
The highest-income live celebrity rating in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson, whose post-mortem income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million, over the past few years.
The other celebrities who had lost their lives, who had earned several times less in the past year, were clearly lagging behind him.
Elvis Presley is the second most powerful celebrity who has left the year's forbes magazine, with 55 million in a year, and a line below the Peanuts writer Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) and Bob Marley (18 million) were included in the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
In Moscow, Igor Gulyayev's first boutique opened.
On 23 October, Igor Gulyayev's first flagship boutique was opened in Moscow.
The designer Igor Gulyayev is known to the general public for his excellent luxury-class fur products.
And now more fashion fans will be able to appreciate them - his first boutique finally opened in Moscow, about which the designer organized a dolce vita party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I have a shop in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
That's how Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted to... try on the models he looked at!
Reactivators are fighting over the width of the seat when large orders are at stake.
There was a violent dispute among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long flights, setting the tone for violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Expo this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-range long-distance flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the performance statements of the last aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard with a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy-class lounges, but its main American Boeing competitor said that this should be decided by airlines.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sale of increasingly large versions of their two-motor long-range aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the 17-21 November event.
The composition of the rear of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - is central to the statements on the cost-effectiveness of the new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people based on economic class seats of more than 17 inches in width, 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats 9 in rows.
Aircraft giants often exchange technical strikes through ads in the professional press.
And now Airbus is speaking directly to the public in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could begin by showing financiers a slide that depicts three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, called "Would you agree to it?"
"Boeing offers long-range flights in seats more narrow than regional turbo-wing planes," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when wide-body Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of an average American male between 40 and 49 years of age increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The coverage of the waist of the 21st century average American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept when the average waist cover of those recently called the "reactive public" was already in place.
Airbus says she commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures by seat size and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines balance tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the passenger compartment does not depend solely on the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they should do to make it happen," said the Boeing expert at Kent Craver's salon.
They don't want us to decide what's gonna make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase space on the sides, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can influence profits.
Behind this debate is a race for airplane orders valued at at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuter first reported in July, the location of seats is exactly what fuels competition in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one place in their last two-motor long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat layout of the 777 design series.
The unit cost gain is reduced when compared with the 10-seat layout currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make his plane more competitive than our designs," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full 10-seat parlors for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating arrangement that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"The 18-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus's offer is due to the threat of the 777 model," said Mary Kirby's interiorist, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-traveling jet salesmen even take their roulettes with them to check competing plans.
All manufacturers also offer very tight aircraft for the airline budget and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-seat rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional alterations to the parlors, offering larger seats at the aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "take off" but may divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
A new antinicotine vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an antinicotine vaccine that could deprive cigarettes of their pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human testing begins, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal at Whale Cornell College of Medicine in New York City said that the first results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start producing a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine impact.
In the tests, the immunized mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that weren't given the vaccine were "relaxed," and that's a sign that nicotine reached their brains, " says researchers.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette, avoiding nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleinikov: one third of the rural settlements of Podmoskovia are fully subsidized
Vice-Governor Podmoskovya Yuri Oleinikov stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were fully subsidized.
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent is 100 per cent.
As part of the regional budget budget, about 25 billion rubles are allocated," said Oleinikov.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Matiš, Odintsovo and Pushkino - had more than 1 billion rubles in revenue for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "it's not enough at all."
The cost of maintaining the local administration in the 88 settlements of Podmoskovia is over 70 per cent, "there is a decline in the quality of services," noted Oleinikov.
It had previously instructed the heads of municipalities of Podmoskovia to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be consolidated, integrated into urban districts or changed to the administrative system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that as part of the administrative reform in Podmoskovje, it was planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
There is also a request for the consolidation of municipalities in the Mojai, Kashir, Solar, Colomensk, Luberts and Kotelnik regions.
Discussions on this issue in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of Mosoblduma, Igor Brynzalov, also stated that some 30 rural settlements in the 12 districts of Podmoskovia were planning to be integrated into the forthcoming admform.
This is because of the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Podmoskovje, less than one third have a "acceptable" financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diane Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diane Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she receives from raising her children.
Even though Arbenina is now giving especially much time to creativity and social activity, she still finds the opportunity to mess with Martha and Artem, not only spending time teaching them, but also entertaining them as much as she can.
In the last week, Diane reported twice to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted on Facebook a picture of how she taught children to read.
And yesterday, I spoiled the fans by showing them how Artema and Martha dressed for Halloween.
The broom racing is ready! our first halloween," Diane called it a picture of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is not wise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have anything to do with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "undefined sex" in child registration
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to say "undefined" instead of "undefined" when registering children born to hermaphrodites.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the sex in the birth certificate blank for the time being.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can write "X" (undefined) for the time being.
The purpose of this decision is not to encourage parents to rush into "explanatory" sex surgery.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obaid.
The former New South Wales Labour Minister, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, refutes the change in the manner in which maritime facilities are rented at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who secretly held shares in three properties on public land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease agreements to Serquiular Ki, where the Obaid family owned two restaurants and cafes without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid ' s clandestine participation in real estate following statements made by Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, former Deputy Chief of Administration, on Thursday.
For several years of discussion, which began in 2005, the Government insisted that rents should be presented for public competition.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the loan agreements for businesses on Sercular Kee, which brought about $2.5 million a year to the Obaid family, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised that the Government ' s rental policy should be changed.
The telephone deciphering provided by ICAC included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had come to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obaid ' s supervision in the Fisheries Division.
"Did the question discussed during these telephone conversations be the development of commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior official of the Administration, in an interview with Fox News, confirmed that Israeli warplanes attacked targets in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but he said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargoes carrying missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of Division 457 can be tested for "authenticity"
The "authenticity" test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to expand repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The Government ' s paper for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia ' s neighbors.
"Expressive statements such as "foreigners at the end of the line" and "first Australians" represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market," she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw the details of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials about human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under review.
If the criteria of "authenticity" are adopted, the applicant for a visa can be examined to determine whether "the candidate is genuine in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the business."
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of Division 457 visas, since previously, enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man ' s sad son, a nine-year-old, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and he was supported by a cousin who was also on board from his father ' s death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semena Varlamova's stated that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism.
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgenia Vavrinyuk, stated that he suffered from alcoholism and was handed over by the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said, inter alia, a woman.
We will recall that Vavrinyuk was sued for beating the Russian goalkeeper Semin Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her hair and beat her - her arms, chest, stomach and neck were damaged after the attack.
Varlamov himself came to Denver's police station and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at $5,000.
The court did not restrict an athlete to travel across the country, but did not allow him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He is also facing imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact on Scotland of the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 aims to open a high-speed link to Scotland and the north of England, starting Phase I in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project "will unite Britain."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was "incredibly excited" about the prospect of working on the plan with the British government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be built in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduction of travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without him, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it's also about city-to-city transport; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message through HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "samely" support the inclusion of Scotland in HS2.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall argument for a high-speed railway across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of next year's study with British ministers and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Tory is the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy requires large areas for generation.
Atomic energy costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of Mendeleev's system.
It is found all over the world and, according to experts, it does not leave waste that has to be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices by aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the US to ease the rules for these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remained in flight mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to do a great deal of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
Civil Aviation Safety also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"The Department of Civil Aviation Safety does not currently have specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it stated.
This issue is governed by regulations that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and require passengers to comply with the safety rules communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the change, but stated that it would follow the regulator ' s instructions.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of client services now that it (the wireless entertainment system) is on our planes," said the press secretary.
Qantas stated that she would adhere to the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change it any time soon," she said.
The FAU regulation applies to United States airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study closely the decision of the FAU and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the effect of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airline.
Carriers will be required to prove that their aircraft are radio resistant to mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, manual packing standards and passenger instructions.
"When the airline checks and confirms the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude," FAU stated.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, heavier devices should be located under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan hears the notes of extremism in Kubani's anthem.
The football match between Angie and Cubanu ended in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar Krai and Dagestan after supporters burned the Daghestan flag and Kubani's anthem sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem of Krasnodar province allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, in particular the war against the Basurmans.
Take the anthem of Krasnodar province, which is now the one that approved this anthem in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one does it.
"I think of you here as my mother, our enemy, our basurmanin, we go to the death fight" - for which to record such words in an anthem, to poison some believers against others," expressed solidarity with the Abdulatype President of Parliament, Hizri Shikhsaid.
Putin got impunity for his friend Assad.
And now, the news from the ocean, that is, Syria, where, as we know today, Israel attacked Russian-made missiles reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Syria has today fulfilled an important condition: to destroy its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the US not to carry out the military operation to which they came close this summer.
More information on the weapons and what this means to the Syrian President will be provided by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend, Vladimir Putin, made.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by mid-year.
And today is an important milestone.
A team of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and heavy task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question isn't whether it's going to happen, it's when it's going to happen.
He's not legit anymore and he has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And I feel even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has been impressed by a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, D.C., the United States Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother to be killed with chemical weapons.
Asad's holding up for now.
And changes the weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and HKH
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry responsible for building and HKK and has offered to lead his ex-Governor of Ivanov oblast, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men at the New Ogarevo residence, and Mein did not refuse to lead the new department.
Russian President Dmitri Peskov ' s spokesperson explained that all the functions relating to construction and HKH were transferred to the new Ministry from the Ministry of the Interior.
Michael Menh, the son of the famous Orthodox priest of the protoyery of Alexander Meh, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry, the name of Hubkin.
His political career began in 1995 - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma of the Sergievo-Posad district, a deputy of the State Duma, the first vice-premier of the Moscow region Government, and the vice-premier of the Moscow government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Menh was governor of Ivanov province.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a pawnshop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling puts in a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested in it," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$300 ($2,400) a month as administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not sufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is increasing - is such that ValueMax, where it deals, became Singapore's third stock exchange pawnshop this week.
Jewelry loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The pawnshops in Singapore usually charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit validation or proof of salary and can lend faster than banks.
Millions of people across the region are therefore turning to pawnshops because families are under pressure because of higher living costs and rapid increases in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a credit rating agency, identified the increase in the family ' s leverage, mainly due to the increase in mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks ' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed the list from 80 per cent of GDP to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand ' s high level of consumer debt, which this week has barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The fact is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower parts of [the income scale] will be looking for ways to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Woon, CIMB economist, Malaysian bank.
The record high price of gold in the last two years has increased the rush with which people put their personal belongings because they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items at 200 pawnshops in the city state are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest pawnshop operator has seen an increase in the number of clients using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors had given rise to criticism because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the pawnshop not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase debt directly.
"The customers are laying things they already own and monetization of personal assets doesn't increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And the pawnshops do not only benefit those categories of people who are in financial distress.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices to provide gold bars or Rolex watches that can provide up to 60 per cent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy persons who need to borrow money for short periods for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of available health facilities and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of care provided.
The implementation of the programme "Modernization of health care in the Tul province for 2011-2013" and the reorganization of our city's health facilities will make it possible to establish an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and pregnant women.
Thus, after integration with the hospital, it became even more possible to attract specialized specialists from the NSCBS to consult pregnant women with different pathologies and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
During the modernization programme, the material and technical facilities of the maternity home have been significantly improved and modern equipment has become available to meet world standards.
Over the years, some 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
The Césarean section uses a Sell-Saver machine to collect blood from an operating wound and, after special treatment, to return it to the woman in question, avoiding blood transfusion.
The Clinical Laboratory Diagnostic Unit is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women ' s clinic has an electronic register, and there are plans for the introduction of electronic maps and patient history in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible for gynaecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns to be consulted by regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
Gangsters reportedly ordered prostitutes to a Strasbourg hotel and then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old previously convicted native of Chechnya.
Bavaria Advocate David Alaba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting on the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he outstrips winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirsher, and the third place by the skier from Gregor Schlirenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Filipino-Nigerian Australian helped his team win the League of Champions, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the Super Bowl of UEFA.
Arshavina's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov.
Andrew Arshavin Julia Baranovska's former civilian wife, Peter's "Zenita," is on vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy at the company of actress Anastasia Zatrojna, her fiancé is physicist Sergei Slavnova, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Images from the couple's joint walks were published in Instagram Anastasia Zachaya.
This isn't Andrea and Julia's first joint photo.
On October 5, Závája published a picture of a couple hugging the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Hawbek "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted to living apart from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovsky and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is meeting with the ex-model Alice Kazmina.
A new friend of Arshavina's was married to a corporate top manager.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for a weakened Tasmanian health care system will be supplemented by strict conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing of the island's population, the higher level of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The four-year funding decision was made following consultations between the Government and independent deputy Andrew Wilkie of Tasmania.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the scheduled operations blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract disposal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money for pre-registration clinics in Hobart and Lonsiston to improve the quality of post-inpatient care, to train health professionals, mental health services and to introduce personal e-health card systems in local hospitals.
"These investments will go to the top doctors' ideas about how best to help the Tasmanian health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would operate under strict accountability and responsibility.
The staff would need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where they spent the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything, "if they are not followed by genuine reform that will put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable footing."
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his first request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will contribute significantly to bringing this state's health system out of critical condition," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional sample procedures largely offset recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is "a solution similar to a leipoplasty."
"The reason we're here is that the Labour government has taken $430 million out of the health care system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nikla's coverage of the Danny Didro novel may be characterized by exceptional productions and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film of the 1760s in France tells the dark story of Susanne, a young aristocrat who was sent to the monastery by her family.
When she starts to rebel, she feels extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist priest and becomes an object of erotic fantasy for others.
The film never goes down to piss or sensation, and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story risks being a test like moisturizer for the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, says the monitoring group
Syria destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions, declared on Thursday an international monitoring group, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near a site where toxic substances were believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the outbreak of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization on the prohibition of chemical weapons was issued one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with and filling with toxic gas.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in Safirah town, where experts believe that the chemical weapons production facility, as well as its storage sites, is located, according to the British-based Syrian Centre for the Defence of Human Rights.
A group of activists who monitored losses through a network of activists in Syria claimed that 120,296 people had died on Thursday.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government ' s side, the group stated that 29,954 were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Al-Assad, 18,678 were pro-Government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among those killed, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations assessment of 25 July, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safir for several weeks against the rebels, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that on Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the short time frame of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was "now satisfied that it has verified and seen the destruction of all critical production and mixing/refueling equipment declared by Syria."
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, as stated by the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that the two sites were said by Syria to be "alerted and ... items of the chemical weapons programme in them have been moved to other declared sites that have been verified."
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safir was one of the two locations that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Üzümcü, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For the third year now, the civil war has confronted the rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad Government and its security forces, which are made up of members of its Alavite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
With regard to other developments, the leader of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a severe explosion on Wednesday at an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentencing the organizers of the Bali attack
The survivors and relatives of the 202 persons killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted with anger to the conviction of the last of the conspirators who had been brought to trial and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in creating the explosive devices used in the terrorist attack.
He may be released within 15 years if he obtains parole.
A 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder following an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including a wave of church bombings throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecutors demanded life sentences, although they could insist that a person called a "bomber" for his reputation as an explosive device maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad," said Ms. Cortin AAP.
I must live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters."
The "Sari" club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in a van parked outside was detonated immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma and died three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiyah, responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muhlasa and Imam Sadula - who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds isn't a lot.
Patek is the last party to the Bali attack to be tried.
He had been in hiding for almost a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where United States troops killed former Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence data indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he caused to other people.
The verdict is in advance of the tenth anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: Air passengers can now use jets on aircraft (but not on mobile phone)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Authority.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is being implemented will vary according to the airline, said FAU administrator Michael Wharth at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAH stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of handheld electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon," FAU stated.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They shouldn't restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives them a "good."
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and rudder periods have been declared by FAA.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitude are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, president of the Association of professional flight attendants, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win scenario," said Glading.
We're really tired of feeling like "school duty" when it comes to that.
But Internet connection for surfing, e-mail, text messages, or downloading will still be banned at less than 10,000 feet, reported the agency.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no Words with Friends, an intellectual Internet game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when the current case occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was on the way.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be put in the luggage compartment, because they can hurt someone if they fly around the entire salon.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU, has regulatory authority over telephone calls.
FAH may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Council, a national expert on CBS News transport safety, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"The cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know, thanks to the FCC, that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee set up by FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow the increased use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAS to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics like Missouri Senator-Democrat Claire McCaskill claim that there are no compelling security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAH began to restrict passengers ' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to signals of interference for navigational and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Wert.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals that are much lower than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when pages are overblown.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on passengers' use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded an entire airliner with Kindle's electronic book readers and flew it to check if there were problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association stated that he considered the interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated pilot messages confirming that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAH allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during boarding in reduced visibility.
The travel industry team welcomed these developments, calling them a reasonable step towards passengers who now use many technological devices.
"We're glad the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Doe, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Motor schools will be able to hold driving licence examinations
Private companies with their own computerized autodrome will be able to take driver ' s test.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to the Government's draft decree on the admission to driving.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 autodromes in Russia.
Students of such "privileged" car schools are expected to count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the completion of the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the students do not take the first time, such a school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for autodromes contained in the draft Government Regulation shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also includes driving requirements for two-wheelers.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an examination in urban traffic in order to obtain category A rights.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would have to obtain Russian rights after passing the examination.
Bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea was released back into the wild
A bird transported by air to shore after being found exhausted at an oil tower in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
The waterpaste was placed in a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said, "This water paste is likely a Northern European winter migrant who has been caught in a zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
Looks like the bird's downped and managed to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes Britain's wealth and job creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders representing a large business sector in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, with special attention to countries that are upgrading and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antimonopoly to product laws, most business leaders felt that control over these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European of all companies agreed.
Last and foremost, our survey of business leaders revealed that the clear majority wants Britain to pursue a change of contract and a trade-based relationship with the EU rather than a policy-based one.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will return authority back to Britain.
The stakes are high - achieving changes in the treaty and better terms for Britain will bring about a 16 per cent shift in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British business supports his plan to reconsider the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and our survey shows that this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' s regulatory environment for business.
U.S. Special Services is listening to the Pope's personal phone.
The Vatican's activities are under the vigilant control of American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection indicate that U.S. intelligence was auditioning all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now heavily protecting Pope Francis.
His phone started listening before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process for the new pope was also monitored.
What the US attached special importance to.
Special Services connected to the cardinals' cell phones, who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the conclave members lived were also bugged.
American spies have been listening to all of the principal applicants for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine says that "a large ear of the US" continued to intercept prelate conversations until the end of the conclave on 12 March.
It is alleged that in the United States, the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been designated as the future Pope since 2005.
American intelligence was also behind the negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine reports that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives, extracting information on politics and financial flows, continues to work at the Roman Embassy of the United States.
The Vatican, in turn, peacefully declared that it does not care about the American wiretap, even if it does.
Holy fathers have no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
A snowboarder for the Olympic bill specifically photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative bank note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
Nominal bills are 100 rubles.
But bloggers on the web are already highly ironic about commemorative banknotes.
After presenting the Olympic Bill on October 30, they noticed that a picture of a snowboarder from a banknote can be found in a photo bank.
In particular, in a free-of-charge storage facility for a photo of StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megabreview on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the RugGear smartphone commercial.
The Olympic banknote was made in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi is shown, on the other hand, the view of the Olympic stadium and the Friar Bird.
The designer of the bank note was Pavel Bushuyev, who won the competition among students at the St. Petersburg Repin Academy of Arts.
The presentation noted that several sports - skiing, freestyle and trampling - were considered, but that they eventually chose snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source Izvesti, close to the CB, the regulator cares about the public's perception of the wide distribution of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknotes and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak, it's not too worried about the olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the Gosznak, Natalya Nikiforov, told Izvestam that all reasoning about plagiarism was ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will turn right, the photos online to the left will clarify Nikiforov.
The man in the photo session to create the bill was taken from different locations, then the final image was selected, and on it was the characteristic snowboarding pose.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote because the artist had received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is positive and positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - plus its promotion - is believed by the Executive Director of the Rusbrand P.P. Alexei Popovichev.
It is difficult to prove a 100 per cent resemblance of images on a bill and in a photo bank, so intellectual property claims against the image are unlikely to come in.
The Olympic banknote first appeared in China - a commemorative banknote in 10 yuan was released for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian beers are in a bad mood.
According to their assumptions, next year's beer consumption in the country will remain stable, and that is at best.
Although the businessmen were initially counting on growth.
This year is a bad year for them: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
All this was reported by Isaac Sheps, head of one of the country's largest brewing companies, President of the Council of the Union of Russian Beers at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute, "Tovars of everyday demand in Russia," which had just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewery industry in the area of beer production and trafficking - a drink with little alcohol content - Shaps informed the audience.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable imposition of ever-new and illogical prohibitions justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewery reported that many of the legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse had little impact, but that new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The most affected beer producers have been the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers at once," said Isaac Shaps.
Beers have two forecasts next year.
Optimistic is the one Shaps was talking about: sales of foam drinks will continue at the same level.
Pessimistic - 2 to 3 percent more.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen have to move away from mass consumer varieties to the "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will be more expensive.
In the meantime, there are no radical consequences to the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol.
"In my observations, the levels of alcohol abuse remain roughly the same, " reported Dr. Alexei Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of sick people who use strong drink surrogates, as well as those who have "settled" on alcohol - containing tonic drinks such as Jaguar, whereas ten years ago it was drinking alcohol that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford vehicle factory in Vsevolozsk.
According to the trade unions, all those dismissed received compensation.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is much more acute than the problems of workers.
The deputy of the Zach Sa Alexei Etmanov at the meeting stated that some 600 people had been reduced at the Ford plant in Vsevolozk.
According to him, this occurred as early as September: some 600 people left the plant under a voluntary dismissal programme developed with the organization ' s union.
Several salaries of gold parachutes have been offered to workers who choose to resign.
As a result, the vast majority left the workplace of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be the case.
However, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support regional enterprises in difficult circumstances," he explained, adding that in adopting the budget the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large drop in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not refuted or corroborated.
We're waiting for an answer from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we're gonna publish it.
There's a lot of talk going on about reducing workers at Ford's factory in All Vologes.
For example, the company ' s plans to fire 600 people became known as early as September.
The plant had previously announced a suspension of the production of vehicles.
The reason given at the plant was the fall in demand for Ford vehicles in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblasty declined by 5.4 per cent in the nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the U.S., mobile phones can be used during take-off and landing of aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of an aircraft have been approved in the United States and are reported by BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules will be in effect by the end of 2013.
However, communications with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometres.
Owing to the risk of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, as in the United States, current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight may also be revised in Britain.
After the Russian Mafia in the United States, a new name, "Brother Circle," was finally established.
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian mob" in America was added by new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli into the Brother Circle.
One of the Russians turned out to be a famous singer, Gregory Leps, who the U.S. is suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
A total of 22 individuals involved in the Brother Circle and six affiliated organizations are on the U.S. blacklist.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
"The 'Brother Circle' statement is more like an attempt to unite scattered criminal groups," previously stated by the organized crime expert and Professor Mark Galeotty of the University of New York.
In his view, the "Brother Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian Mafia."
"I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quote Mr. Galeotty, the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelley of the University agrees with Mr. Galeotty.
"If they are working together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," says the Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotty suggested that the "Brother Circle" brought together more closely Russian thieves in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, Lashi Shusanashvili and Zakaria Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely associated with Santa Hassan, while another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Santa Hassan.
He noted, however, that some individuals had nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were more likely to share common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, Russia's favorite singer, Vladimir Putin, in the "Brother Circle," caught Kremlin's attention.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, and a decision was made on why he was placed on such lists, " said the press secretary of the Head of State, Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas industry.
The start of the construction of the Southern Flow pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today there was a landmark event: construction began on the Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said Gazprom President Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Flow is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's European gas, increases the risk level for normal routes, is said by officials.
Miller stated that a direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries, further along the gas pipeline route, by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff members were charged with sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has learned.
Two YMCA NSW staff members were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were filed in 2011 against a child care worker in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But the commission's opening statement stated that it had "never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization."
The Chief Executive Officer, Philip Hare, was asked about one case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Hall gym instructor had been convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, the lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA had also made inaccuracies in its opening speech to the commission, arguing that "there were external YMCA audits that acknowledged that YMCA was in the forefront of child safety."
The evidence submitted to the Commission indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible quality audit evaluations conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had missed by hiring Lord and failed to ensure that staff had a clear understanding of their obligations to report violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the assumption that YMCA corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations in children's safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, personally caring for them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's direction and asked to be trained to protect her children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child care manager of YMCA's unit in Karingbach, who was Lord's leader, "very scary and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept staff explanations that it was awkward for them to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with Lord led them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented his view to the YMCA board of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from Jonathan Lord's incident was not "the provision of information" by staff members, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force staff members to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations had been made was made by the Director General of YMCA for the custody of Liam Whitley's children.
He said that it was intended to prevent the destruction of evidence, but that it was "re-emerged" and that the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-friendly organization during Jonathan Lord ' s tenure in the period 2009-2011, reported to the commission by an expert on child abuse, Professor Stephen Smolbone of Griffith University.
He said that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, selection, guidance, training and monitoring.
The hearing is postponed until December 20th.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She's considered a real star, not just a model, in her home country.
Even though Giselle Bundschen left her job for a while, she was distracted by motherhood, and for this week, she arrived on purpose.
The months of absence did not prevent her from keeping her seat on the runway and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest paid supermodel.
This time, she was in the Colcci defile.
Fashion Week Finals are usually the most interesting shows.
Like the stylist Lino Villaventura did.
Marke has been active in theatre and cinema for more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of prot-a-port class, making performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and fashion world participated in São Paulo in the coming fashion week.
It is one of the most dynamic sectors of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, with an annual turnover of up to $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance of returning as British Prime Minister, but he admitted that return was unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of the resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after 10 years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the four Middle East peacekeepers.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but it's not likely to happen, so..."
Milana's chief coach, Massimiliano Allegri, expressed regret at no results in the 10th tournament of Italy's Championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to the major players.
I'm sorry that we failed to win, " gives Tmw the words of Allegrey.
The team played a good match, creating three or four good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
The second Romans were added, but in general I can't say we're out of concentration.
You should have won.
Last season, we did the task of getting into the League of Champions.
Now we're behind schedule, but it's due to a series of injuries to key football players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at the high-level meeting on Kaka.
Experts from the Confederate Activities, who went to Cardiff to fight for the Los Angeles of the Year prize, knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had taken his first steps in just a few months before, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Toffy ran through three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This indistinguishable couple - the same height - received high marks for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybenk Horse Sports Centre in Radri, near Cardiff.
When he saw men and women in fine cauldron hats, he moved his hat and proudly spent two years in the circle of Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his not-for-year-old innate ability to treat horses.
And Toffy got the highest grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy for his third birthday last March, and since then he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy make a great duet."
They had many rivals, but those two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Totally strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vail in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of her Aunt Sharon Howels, who has displayed horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The whole audience was struck, and everyone screamed approval and clapping."
He ran across the sand all the way through the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did a fine job.
Fenton's crazy about animals-- he likes horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging from the way he started, he's about to be involved in "Loshade of the Year" - and I'm sure he'll do well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges marked Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves on the show.
They assess the coherence of the performance of the pony and the manufacturer, Fenton and Toffy, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped out with his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the call "to be reorganized"
The Chinese newspaper, which had published on the front page a call for the release of the defendant in defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized and reported by the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper in Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles about a company with State ownership.
Now the New Express has to go through the "total error correction process," according to the regulator.
An order for error correction came from the Guangdong Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group newspaper New Express published several false reports on Zoomlion's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express Manual was disoriented," said the regulator's statement.
He states that a decision has been taken "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his reporter's licence."
He also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to fully correct the errors in the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation of the newspaper's officials and immediately amend the New Express leadership."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, stating that she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust," he said to the State broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing someone to self-incriminate.
The US - Mexico Tunnel for Drug Trafficking, equipped with its own railway, was discovered
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this four-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most difficult secret moves they've ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are about six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitates the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, as the authorities stated.
According to judicial documents, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which posed a challenge to drug cartels to deliver their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards with rail tracks from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November this year and have been reported to BELT ' s correspondent at the Directorate-General of Pensions of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
As from 1 November of this year, the average wage of workers in the Republic, applied in the previous pension recalculation, will be adjusted to an increase of 5.4 per cent, and the corresponding calculation of labour pensions will be made in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recalculation, it is estimated that the retirement pension will increase by an average of 5.3 per cent as of November.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
At the same time as the recalculation of labour pensions in November this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplementary pensions will be recalculated in response to the increase in the subsistence budget on average per capita.
For the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014, BPM was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 530 - 2.1 per cent higher than in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and pension supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion-0-0 per cent of the increase was earmarked for pensions in 2013.
The British police give Assanjo a notice of extradition
The British police today issued a notice of extradition to Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian a "official demand to surrender" to report to the police station, adding that if he failed to do so, he would be subject to further arrest.
Assanju is facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his powers under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, requesting political asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard "gives a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which requires him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice," as reported by the press secretary.
He continues to violate the terms of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the notice to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic deserts on the anti-secret WikiLeaks website.
A driver driving 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined £1000.
The vehicle was fined £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howie of Tippy, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take him out between his legs.
In Colchester Howie's Magistrate's Court, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving licence resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also required to pay the cost of £90 and an additional fee of £100 to assist victims of crime.
The tax on foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury had made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, had introduced a public duty rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments to buyers who decided to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the government has invested 708 million pounds in housing in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts in the 2012/13 fiscal year, exceeding the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: "After the increase in government spending on expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is very difficult to claim that taxation on expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move could lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or the current owners would not want to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class real estate - the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price - in the rich south-west belt of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown to record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in the centre of London continued to show steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent, but they were overshadowed by an active "domestic market" with price spikes in the south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) cities.
Scientists shed light on how the movement of the dog's tail is related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs are flinging their tails right (from the dog's point of view), while troubled dogs wave their tails mainly to the left.
But scientists now say that other members of the dog family can notice and respond to these subtle differences in tailing.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigara, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says, "It is well known that people's left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of motors that generate positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it from other species as well.
He added that just as humans do, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the multifaceted twisting of the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals as they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of animal heartbeats and analysed their behavior.
Perhaps soon we'll understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We showed dogs videos - either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When animals saw the rest of the unexpressed dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the waving dog's tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that their tail was leaning mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog's waving tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should be concerned about and which ones they should not be concerned about.
He notes: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tail is often pinned in one way by more friendly behaviour, and the right side is less friendly, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a better understanding of their animal emotions.
An expert in dog conduct, John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at Bristol University Veterinary School, said that it was not the first study to test whether dogs were relevant to the left and right.
Last year, a group of scientists at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a happy dog.
And in another academic work at Victoria University in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the waving of its tail was directed to the left rather than the right rather than to the right, rather than to become alarmed, the opposite behaviour towards Italian research."
He said that the difference could be because dogs in various studies did not fully view animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"while there is sufficient evidence for various mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are being used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys are delaying a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness.
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was supposed to perform at Hydro's city concert site on Friday.

This statement was made after she was also forced to postpone the LG Arena concert in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys stated: "After deciding to move the show to Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with "laringitis," and unfortunately he's not in a position to perform."
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham is now on November 20, and the show at Glasgow on November 21, Hydro.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will raise new Catholic cardinals for the first time in his service on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal can no longer take part in the Pope's election - the prerogative of a group of 120 "Cardinals."
In announcing the news, the Vatican's press secretary, Father Federico Lombardy, said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held prior to the ceremony.
"Dad Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of Cardinal electors is likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of cardinals back to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he wishes.
Consistory next year will be important because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
So far, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
"It would be interesting to see if the new pope would appoint cardinals from other parts of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
It will also be the first Cardinals chosen since Francis formed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are charged with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said "perhaps" that Francis would turn to the Cardinals for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before - this is our first time.
Valero said that the popes usually promoted the cardinal bishops from the major parishes, but Francis "a field of surprises - so we don't know who he's going to call."
GM withdraws a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws almost 19,000 brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in accordance with Friday's notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators.
For some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle head restraint safety standards.
"In the event of a rear impact, the head restraint may not adequately protect the occupants by increasing the risk of injury" is stated in the notification posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The production of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important serialization of the car for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to consider notifying owners of the 16-day suspension of the Government, which reduced the growth in car sales in October.
The sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of the year, as stated by GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM stocks on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The Shrieking of Obama's Disappointment
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to undermine commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama's reformed health system website, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in a time of depression in my second year of medical school and restore me to a sense of hope.
It's called "Trust for victory," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients tonight and go to bed, this book brings me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take the spirit.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents were saving all the newspapers they could find.
A young strategist team was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a gross awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, there have indeed been changes.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his many and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the "Don't ask, don't say" rule, the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the Guantánamo base, among others.
But after countless times when I stood on the side of Obama's administration to protect her in front of colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I could provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or to be hit by drones on innocent children in other countries.
He could not explain the collection of American privacy data by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of exposers who reveal wrongdoing by the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or the failure to meet the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusion that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
More recently, it cannot justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to realize at the age of 18 that leadership could run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the election is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have mentioned above show that they were to a large extent the choice of the administration.
And that's what's bothering me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
In my second term, I thought that Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for so long.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 with this book.
It makes me miss a lot of promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes Clinton's stunning defeat in Pennsylvania's primary election.
At a meeting to analyse the causes of the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain committed to their goal.
"I want us to return our appeal," he said.
- We have to remember who we are."
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the matter of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he was trying to ignore questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deciding to cancel carbon taxes and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott ' s daughter would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they are on leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer to be the winner of the Sanshein-Kost seat of the Fairfax constituency, with 53 votes over.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the procedure for counting votes in the elections in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget's daughters.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system so that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the bulletins.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
It seems weird to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission is exploring possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his programme included the Sunshine Cost International Airport and would take his new job "very seriously."
Public office involves public service.
"We don't seek any reward except for the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS removes two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirming that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged currency market manipulations is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world ' s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world ' s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff to be suspended during an ongoing investigation that resonates with a scandal related to the manipulation of the LIBOR interbank rate.
By refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation of this matter continues, and we cooperate fully with the FCA and our other regulators," reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, knowledgeable individuals said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader to the British Financial Control Authority (FSA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave for his current position as head of European spot exchange at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of the European spot bid at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior monetary trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any wrongdoing.
The contact group for Mr. Asher's instant messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
The UBS Bank reported this week that it took action against some of its employees after the Swiss governor Finma said he was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, said persons familiar with the situation.
Banks look at instant messages and e-mails over several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
In recent years, there has been news of audits by traders in the area of activities that have been one of the largest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units, but this year has encountered difficulties in view of the fact that low currency volatility reduces the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of domestic platforms by banks means that "you can start influencing the market at a very low price."
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its stock-trade traders this week after he had caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
"We're sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter was located," reported Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama ' s Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health law is constitutional, which is a major victory for Obama's administration.
In a vote of 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Act requiring citizens to obtain health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government ' s tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further held that the requirement of the Health Act that states should improve their compliance with Medicaid, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for Medicaid, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business filed an action to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open rostrum, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
One of the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasus because it was a game of scandal and discord.
Speaker Sergei Narushkin recalled the recent events in Birulev and said that in order to reduce the "degree of social tension," politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
He must have been referring to a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who, in one of the TV shows, threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which had contributed to the debate ' s Sumbury.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Birulev were "model conflict that could be predicted," but "there are too many people and authorities responding to these questions," and seven babysitters have an eyeless child.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practised against migrants has, in the opinion of a social worker, failed and must be found.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hope in a new unified history textbook.
"There is also a need to create a handbook on the history of the culture of the people of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what people live for in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zuganov proposed to criminalize "calls for dismemberment of Russia": "If the U.S. radio says you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard to "no-burn."
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national issues to public debate: "In the heat of controversy, there is little to say!"
Vladimir Vasiliev, leader of the "One Russia" faction, immediately advised the journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to talk about it carefully, and then the same commitments could be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, as stated by Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that made regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share his enthusiasm for the law: it does not have "a clear understanding of what adaptation is of migrants, of its mechanisms and limits.
Thus, actors will have different interpretations of the scope of these powers.
In addition, municipalities lack the necessary staff to deal with such complex issues, lack the means, and the centre does not provide them with the guidance they could use...
The head of the Dumian Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the threatening name "Ministry of National Security" to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar agency, which was subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, "a minister without a portfolio," who can be contacted if something happens.
"We walk on the edge, the shells explode next to each other, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to speak out against provocations, and this work should be supported with the right information," said the representative of the RPC for Relations with Society, Vsevolod Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality on the part of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nealov took the discussion suddenly: "There are more talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, they still need to be searched, but they're being pushed on the wrong road, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be equal in the world in this sport!" said the rightross fervently.
No one will play in the Caucasus in rugby!
You're gonna offer them some more curling!
We need to know the national features, it's like the Georgian's "Littleman" offering...
In Yaroslavla, wild behavior on the stands was distinguished by the representatives of the Moscow Club - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
Arthur Grigorianz, head of the Russian Federation's supervisory and disciplinary committee, reported that "Cuban" had been fined 500,000 roubles and transferred from the S.E.C.'s Football House to Philippe PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were imposed for burning the flag of Dagestan by supporters at the rostrum during the 14th tour home match against Angie.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a member of the FRPL.
We've been researching all the materials available.
The Cuban viewers are fined 500,000 rubles for their improper conduct.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei, suits for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent actions against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the price of which was cut off at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel's patents, filed patent infringement claims with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare Internet search keywords with their corresponding advertising, as stated in the claim, which is the basis of Google's search engine.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar representatives were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating on the Android operating system from Google, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google raised the price several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, part of the determining factor in the deal was the Motorola patent library.
"In spite of a failed bid to purchase the patent that is the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate it," says the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased damages from Google, as he claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president is sworn in.
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he sworn in as the first freely elected President of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes at the courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi during a solemn ceremony broadcast live on State television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American entity from Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization that had been the target of violent actions by successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new President, and unlike the Mubarak presidential pomp, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on a generally busy road linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charisma "spare wheel" of Brothers, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the 2011 rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden panels of the hall where he took the oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the "peaceful" counter.
A soldier, Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan "The Army and the People - One Hand," which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became the stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath of office on Friday at Tahrir Square, where an uprising broke out, ending Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to regain the authority of the President, who was deprived of his office by a military council that accepted cases from a deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath of office before the court, and not before Parliament, as is accepted, he is fulfilling the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tyumen Engineering Association took place at the Jalutor Motor Vehicle Plant.
The event included a presentation of a new line for the production of welded steel pipes.
According to business director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tyumen region was conducted in 2011 with the arrival of a new owner.
It turns out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welds per month.
This was followed by a decision to change the plant ' s profile and installation of machinery for its production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of production have been shipped.
Investment in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, says Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new station was launched to expand the range.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for the company, small-scale construction and furniture industries, and a large pipe profile for the construction industry.
Planned to reach the production level of 50,000 tons per year, which would represent about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 - and in the plans for the purchase of new equipment, the increase of staff by more than 50 additional employees.
The enterprise is re-trained and the necessary specialists are selected from existing ones.
It is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutting aggregate of up to 5 millimetres in the coming year, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another plant, at a pipe production rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprise will have developed the production of pipes used in housing and utilities.
The company ' s management aims to close up to 70 per cent of Tumen ' s demand for these products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, addressed the business managers and advised that more attention should be paid to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This includes forms of public support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year, 150 million roubles have been earmarked for this purpose, two thirds of which has already been spent.
The last commission, which will review subsidy contracts, adopts documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses local producers for their participation in international fairs.
A budget of 150 million roubles is budgeted for next year to compensate for leasing fees and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated for participation in fairs, and three million will be allocated for energy conservation programmes.
The cost of reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment produced in the southern Tumen region for the oil and gas complex is reduced to 72 million roubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this form of support would eventually cease because the rationale for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax paid by oil companies to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers direct support for the industrial sector to be a priority, not the financing of the oil sector through them.
Budget assistance will involve investment projects to be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the emerging oil situation.
The grant for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the southern Tyumen region, and it will be difficult to compete at a price with the Russian middle strip, where the labour force is cheaper.
Moreover, the continuity of the new owner of the RV-TNC, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvat Project will expire in 2013 and no requests for extension have been received.
At present, enterprises in the south of the region that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot establish a portfolio of orders for the next year.
It remains open to question whether taxes from the oil produced in the Uvat region will be paid to the region ' s budget or whether they will be paid at the place where the new owner of the deposits is registered.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist social media video.
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who posted an extremist video on the social network, and told RIA Newsti on Friday, a representative of the Regional Court Press Service.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted on his page on a popular social network a video on a federal list of extremist material.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code entitled "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of a person, committed in public."
"The Lenin District Court dealt with the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a penalty of 240 hours of compulsory labour," said the agency's interviewer.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will decline significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in his Facebook account with readers.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would have to go down.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices would not be so direct, it would be indirect.
But there shouldn't be any price increases either.
So the billboards that have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, it's not quite true, or, to be precise, it's not true," Azarov summarized.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bijsk
On 29 October, the media reported that a kindergarten teacher in Bijska had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances and are also providing a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After being accused of bad taste, Eugenia Vasileva spoke.
Eugenia Vasilieva, who has received close media attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous press publications about both the thefts in the Ministry of Defence and her personal relationship with ex-Minister of Defence Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuables.
However, on 1 November, the figure in the Oboronservice case broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasilieva stated: "The original task was, of course, exactly one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Secretary of Defense."
I was blackmailed to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of the win.
However, the interview concluded that perhaps Vasilev was the one most affected by the words that she did not care about her taste.
It is probably meant to refer to the statement made by the official representative of the UK of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that the paintings collected by the figure in the Oboronservice case revealed counterfeits.
Among the property arrested, there are a number of paintings that the hostess, confident of her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expert appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap counterfeits," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from DOD, and they said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just a mess, " says Vasileva.
However, on the question of whether she was guilty of at least one of the 12 criminal incidents she was charged with, Vasileva said, "No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there was no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
Just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the UK of the Russian Federation that Vasileva was avoiding the examination of the criminal case file, the figurer's lawyer stated that he and his client were "not being allowed to familiarize themselves with the case file."
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasileva under house arrest, who still has no contact with the press?
Maybe how could a woman fail to respond to a bad taste charge?
Or is it true that the Komsomolka journalists claimed a couple of days ago that she had "been in a bigger trance under house arrest" because of news of the reconciliation between Anatoly Serdiukov and his wife and his return to the family bed?
KP's famous military columnist, Victor Baranets, wrote in his article "The Hearts Returned to their Wife?": "The Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more chatty in interrogation."

Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its profit forecast for a full year and expects record respite income in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This tourism firm now expects its main total annual income to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with the previous projection of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre received 8% of the profits in the first half of the year and began the second half of the year with good performance, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"From the beginning of the year, we've been working profitably in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to make record profits in a full year, before deducting interest and tax contributions," he said.
- This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the biggest profits."
In Australia, the leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre's leisure business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and it is expected that profits will be earned for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre's stock grew by three cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, Barnaul police identified two playrooms.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Rise Street.
There was a game at the time of the test.
The club counted 24 assault rifles.
Another game club was found in Lenin District on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 ATMs used here.
The UMVD of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been compiled under the article "Illegal organization and gambling."
The techs have been seized.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who murdered two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in Sverdlovsk province, the day before the day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after the fire had been put out in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Ural Street, the bodies of two women were found with signs of violent death.
The victims were soon identified.
They were found to be sisters, one of whom was a 44-year-old woman in Yekaterinburg, the other a 33-year-old woman in Orenburg province.
They rented a burned-down apartment a few days ago.
His investigation came under the personal control of Chief Police Officer Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are working on various versions of the murder, checking the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons who are prone to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for which women rented an apartment, and where they had lived before that, what they did, who they were in contact with.
Schools were encouraged to pay more attention to mathematics, orthography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The "non-programme texts" will also be presented at the examination in order to encourage wider reading.
The joint English literature and language course will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final examination in the language, with persistent recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is expected to issue new curricula tomorrow in English and mathematics, the first subject to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other substantive subjects next year.
A separate regulatory body for OFQUAL examinations will present a revised structure of secondary school final examinations, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus that we should reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting that school graduation examinations would be "more complex, more ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, while in Singapore students study about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time in the math calendar, coalition sources have said that large-scale school math exams, combined with a higher ratio in the rating table, are likely to provide incentives for schools to provide additional education in this subject.
The curriculum will focus more on real-life goals, including financial mathematics.
The Heihe tickets will cost the tourists 2,200 rubles.
As of tomorrow, tourists from Good News in Heihe will start carrying ships on a pillow.
For those who want to go to China, it means extra spending.
Puma tickets are traditionally much more expensive than a warmer boat.
According to Amurasso's help desk, the cost of a regular ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
Travel through the comfort room will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, tickets didn't cost much this season: at the same price, the puma took tourists last spring and a year ago in the fall.
Dimitri Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers the Russian Federation to be short of growth in its GDP and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business credit conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, based on innovation, by Reuters.
We've been planning GDP growth in the 3% area this year, maybe even a little bit more.
It's actually gonna be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and indeed, a higher rate of development is required.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal loans at normal prices - the first thing that must be done" - emphasized by the head of government.

Travel by dirt, river and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients.
There aren't many doctors in this West African country - just one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main heroes to become CNN's hero of the year.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding job.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and return to unconscious condition, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that was reminiscent of itself for the rest of its life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving all the treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," Bwell said.
You can leave home at 5:00 in the morning, run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them wouldn't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of its health expenditure is private.
"The only problem is poverty," said Bwelle.
- And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
As he saw the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which arranges trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are forced into vans, tied to rooftops by medical supplies and travelling across the terrain to visit needy villages.
They don't always get lucky.
Many times they had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: a celebration with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwell, with his broad smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip," Bwell said.
They come from the whole neighborhood within a 60 km radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-care clinics provides a variety of health services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can obtain crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents needed for school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team conducts simple operations under local anaesthesia.
Operations are generally carried out in the school, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light up operating and sanitary equipment, Bwell and his volunteers operate until early Sunday morning.
It's an inexhaustible pace, but the team's commitment usually helps support village musicians.
"They've been kicking drums all night to keep us awake and working," Bwell said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these weekend clinical treatments and hospital work by surgeon Bwella, he also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, which provided 60 per cent of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in the Bwell group.
He's always either in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization so he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his task, this is an opportunity that they would never have had at home.
"We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep tools for Dr. Bwell," said O'Malley.
As a second-year student, you would never have had such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bwella.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, the almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father's promise, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my dad.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretap.
The deputy of the Bundestag of Hans-Cristian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, the question was raised whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Attorney-General's Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the U.S. Special Prosecutor's Office.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it very clear, as Hans-Cristian Strebele said, that he knew so much.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But first, we have to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal over US spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday that imposes additional restrictions on the United States electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in the development and deepening of relations in all spheres and areas.
This was announced to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Makei, at a press conference following the meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, a reporter from BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two Governments will provide all-round assistance and support to entrepreneurs who are making direct trade and economic contacts among themselves," noted Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would provide all necessary facilities and assistance.
The Minister also reported that the eighth meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, following which a protocol had been signed.
The parties have drawn up a road map for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy and the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners," he said.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
In the Minister's view, trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needed to be further developed, since there was an unutilized potential in that area, he said.
Relations among our countries have always been very warm, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the success of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoğlu noted.
Obama refuses to speak about health care.
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama turned back yesterday on his often repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
As hundreds of thousands of people have been notified of the interruption of services from their providers, Republicans have criticized the President in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday Obama made a few adjustments to his original public promise.
"The majority of people who have health insurance that works can keep it," he said in his performance in Boston.
Referring to what he described as a "updated news" about the interruption of services, Obama encouraged the receiving Americans to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance plans at the same or even cheaper cost than anticipated.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because they do not meet the new standards required under the Access to Health Care Act.
"Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Sibelius in her address to the House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site had been going "worstly bad" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
- I really want your trust back."
Annoyed Sybelius dropped this phrase, which was picked up by an on-line microphone sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the chamber after a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health program herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sybelius to say why the "architector" of the Affordable Medical Care Act has not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to purchase the HealthCare.gov plan, which she is now imposing on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency has been stripped of media status for uncensored fighting.
On October 31, Mosgoruz decided to invalidate the licence to register with the Rosbalt agency, wrote "Lenta."
Roscomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of its status - for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was set: the court found it possible to close down the media by effectively denying publication the right to counterargument.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representation in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet SMIs in Russia.
In doing so, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche, with the Agency's exclusive publications being (and still being) a reference to sources within law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the security structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive source base in the various agencies, it was also in favour of such assumptions that Natalia Chaplin, Victor Cherkesov's wife, was in charge of the project.
However, the role of Chaplin in Rosbalt's leadership is not entirely clear: it is most often referred to as the "project leader."
The Director General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, the editor-in-chief of Nicolai Ulyanov.
In recent years, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the liveinternet ranking of Russian media sites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (up to 500,000 views), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are the notes on the Kremlin's powerless relationship with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of King and Jester, and the pogroms in the Metropolitan Turbulent.
The Rosbalta's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, prohibiting journalists from engaging in uncensored fighting.
The office found a prohibited language in two videos published on the website of the agency (Gigit of Krasnodar and Pussy Riot desecrated the oil towers).
The others are described in different ways.
Roscomnadzor, on the basis of the video footage found, accused the Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to withdraw its licence from the agency.
Rosbalta stated that the agency's claims were unlawful: first, the clips were not editorial materials, second, the material words in them were disguised, and third, immediately after warning, the video was removed from the site.
The agency ' s representatives appealed against Roscomnadzor ' s claims before the Magistrate ' s Court - and when Mosgoruz accepted the Roskomnadzor ' s claim on 22 October 2013, those complaints were still pending.
However, the justice of the peace has already ruled against the Rosbalt 25: the editor-in-chief, Nikolay Ulyanov, was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles - 10,000 each.
Obviously, this preempted the outcome of the Mosgoruda hearing - if you forgot the thought that the outcome might have been pre-empted.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate the Rosbalt registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that the Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (a statement to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, signed on 10 October by 26 deputies; the document was submitted on the initiative of the RPNF).
The President of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Vsevolod Bogdanov, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Güsev, and the Presidential Council for Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, stated that the closure was inappropriate.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roscomnadzor's leadership even gave him some assurance that it would not be possible to withdraw his licence.
The trial of Rosbalt has shown that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to have the media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament in Damascus has been completed one day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare the chemical warfare agents for use, transferring the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of the toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the toxic substances were currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August, according to the United States.
The primary task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the Western intelligence services.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new verification sites if there was reason to suspect that Damascus was not fully exposed.
The United States believed that the shelling had been carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this was the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership, as agreed with Russia ' s mediation, destroy or render unworkable all the facilities for the production of projectiles that poison gases and liquids and the filling of projectiles with these substances.
Now that this stage has been reached, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in the hands of the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisons, skin-infested mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
Its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable - two weeks.
The head of OPCW field operations, Jerry Smith, stated to the BBC that his inspectors had "supervised the destruction of equipment personally."
"They no longer have the ability to further produce or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the projectiles and poison plants had either been destroyed or rendered useless.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult" because it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was not yet time to celebrate with the inspectors - they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US spying "has gone too far"
John Kerry has shown a lightening of US surveillance tactics by making an unprecedented admission that, in some cases, US spying "has gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "on autopilot" at the time of Edward Snowden's loud revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, actually took some of the things that were happening on the autopilot, because such an opportunity already existed - both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war and, of course, 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage went too far, but stressed that no one's rights were violated.
He said, "In some cases this has gone far.
And the President is determined to shed light on the matter and explain himself to people, and is conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashing, building explosions and killing people because we were able to find out about those plans in advance."
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US overseas espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the US, said the chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
The Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"In the interest of US national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who serves as first-time president of the Senate's international relations subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
- And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs."
News that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the US.
Other disclosures included documents released by Snowden indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor Angela Merkel ' s mobile phone, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Klapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was a routine matter on both sides.
Against the background of that noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit by members of Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and of both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "good motive" would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programmes they themselves had used for many years.
"As we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the issues of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
The influence of prison guards will increase in the new compositions of the public monitoring commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (CP) can approve new members of the Public Observation Commissions (PCCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
The CNC is a public body that monitors the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonida Rozzaev, the unrest in the Copenhagen colony - it is through the ONC that most high-profile incidents are reported behind bars.
Control of the RNA is being fought between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of SNCs, I suggested that human rights experience should be a criterion for selection.
"He wasn't accepted, and they made lists without criteria," says Valerie Borschev.
Borschov, the current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is an all-Russian network of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
As a member of the State Duma for Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the NPC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the composition of JNCs in 43 regions of the country.
There were fewer than 1,000 applicants for 1,800 vacancies, and competitions could not be organized in Ingushetiya and Kabardino-Balkaria owing to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to set up a doll for the vacant seats.
MNC Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new membership instead of 20.
According to Borschchev, the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission is 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and the option that is being voted in the OP varies by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted on the capital commission.
However, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a representative of the Fighting Brotherhood, may re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the CNC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borschov believes that the security forces, by appointing their Chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so that human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by a member of the ROK, Anton Tsvetkov, who is the head of "Russian officers," an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on a rut," said RBC daily Anton Flower.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says that he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Flower, he wasn't even interested in what list they're voting for at the OP.
He considers the release of information to the Borschks to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in the leadership of the Chelabian ONC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year ' s Copenhagen unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the management of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
But ROK Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silivists.
From the new list of missing human rights defenders, the chairman of the local commission turned out to be one of his opponents, even though in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber ruled him out for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Stock Commissions of the Borschov consider "the place for the Copeisk."
The revelations of Tolokonnikova's hope did not affect the NOC Mordovia, which is believed to be "powerful": only one human rights defender wanted to join the new team, and she did not even accept the documents for the contest.
Board member Nikolai Swanidze told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list because he was appalled by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says that he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The Deputy Secretary of OP, Vladislav Grib, also a member of the FIN Research Institute, coordinated the drawing up of the lists.
The Mryb told RBC daily that it did not consider it appropriate to divide candidates for human rights defenders and law enforcement officers, and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to obstruct the work of its members.
The Mushroom does not predict the outcome of the OP board vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
An Australian woman filed an appeal against a prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment on Phuket Island for false allegations that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of filing a false claim following a report by the Thai police that a local taxi driver had attacked her on Sunday night on 10 June, while two other men were holding her.
However, the security footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after having broken up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment in a general-regime detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a women ' s adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telephone that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
"It was obviously an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible," said Tanks.
Bamford appealed her conviction and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in a court increasing her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Roman Senchin is currently in Paris at the French translation of his novel, "Eltsysheva."
Let me remind you that this is his novel that has become the finalist of four awards: Clear Pole, Russian Booker, National Bestseller, and Big Book.
And last year, a writer for this book was awarded a prize by the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is a clear leader in the generation of the present 30-year-old and 40-year-old prosaics.
Virtually every publication of its hard, modern-day stories and narratives is a source of heated debate among critics of a variety of different backgrounds.
It can be argued that the combined articles on Senchin ' s prose and publication, reviews of his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
Discussions about "one of the most controversial contemporary writers" have, according to the criticism of Sergei Chuprinin, focused on what participants mean by "literacy," as we see the present and the future not only of our words but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles tend to be reduced in the "Abzats" sections...
