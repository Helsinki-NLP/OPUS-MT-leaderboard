The social map of a resident of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the retention of the travel benefit in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the procedure for the organization of citizens ' preferential travel has changed, using the social map of the residents of Ivanov province.
According to the press service of the Government of the Russian Federation in Ivanov province, the changes provide for the maintenance of the travel benefit in public passenger transport and bring the social card netting scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 on the national payment system.
At the same time, the social map of a resident of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
Thus, the replenishment limit is no longer fixed on travel as before, but on monetary terms, with winter and summer periods of no more than 400 rubles, and in summer, no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
The social card holders will now need to track the balance of money rather than the number of remaining trips on the transport receipts.
The preferential fare for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier ' s tariff.
The regional budget reimburses the remaining half of the cost of travel.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social map travel arrangements will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed accounting of spending on the social map to the nearest cents.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning credits but unspent funds.
It should also be added that the calculation scheme with the carriers is becoming transparent, as half the cost of travel is now paid by the citizen, and the same amount is paid back to the carrier.
There will be no commission to charge money on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Roads and Transport of Ivanov province, reported that in 2014, more than 33 million social map trips were carried out in the region, and in 2015 almost 25 million trips.
More than 470 million rubles have been allocated in the regional budget to provide citizens with preferential travel using the social map.
As at 1 September, more than 312 million roubles had been reimbursed for this purpose.
During the 911 call, the teacher confesses to murdering a friend.
During a 911 voice call, with almost no trembling, university teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that there was a need for staff to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the contact of the deceased's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note that was sloppyly written on a white sheet of lime paper: "I'm sorry, I wish I could get it back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to the university campus by then, where the police believed he had shot and killed all the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Baford, reported that the university staff had learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to put into one picture the motives behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and employees who knew him, helped to paint a portrait of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he interacted in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamba, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 about how he was dealing with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
He only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that a doctor ' s degree, for which Lamb worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic position as a teacher.
University president William Laforge said he didn't know anything about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
The police attacked Lamb after he escaped from campus when he was on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-gauge gun in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in Greenville suburb, Mississippi, with a Washington County coroner named Metel Johnson.
His engine was still on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and teaching.
He received a Ph.D. in Pedagogy in the spring of the same year.
An old friend of Lamb's described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Harston told me that she was 15, and Lambo was 20 years old when they met through their mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool, older guy who spent years trying to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Harston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been dating for a while.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, whose back side was coming out.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She's really depressed," told O'Steen about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he wasn't dating Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played concerts together from time to time.
O'Steen told me that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, the bartender and co-counsel of entertainment programs at The Julep Room party bar in Gauthier's suburbs, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lipstick for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for freshman students and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, says Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three little children.
He attended the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, attended a memorial candlelight ceremony.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Jeff Schmidt's brother also attended a ceremony during which Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace performed at the university choir.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
It's recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare Associated Press by Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to a statement by the police that Lamba's call came into service 911 after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, while the toy and child goods handler assures that he will give staff and temporary staff more hours to work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announced that it would start interviews with the applicants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although it is still a few months away from the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to have enough staff in shops and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" turned out to be a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of the royal family, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and then I saw Princess Diane sitting next to me," he told me in a trailer by the soon-to-be-screen documentary "Back in Time."
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am literally at a distance from my hand and in the same fake bee from my date with Princess Wales.
"Back in time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as directed by Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "is undoubtedly the greatest movie about time travel that has ever been made."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The Head of the United Nations declares that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, that there is no "war solution" for almost five years of conflict, and an increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Head again called on all participants, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon announced at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences within the Council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had made the situation "resolved."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had shown in addressing the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump isn't kidding.
Some tried to label him as a provocation.
Others waved away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some people want a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have failed (for now).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double-digit numbers, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for a real estate magnate in terms of the chances of being nominated.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry gave his foreplay to Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups such as the "Super Committee of Political Activity" of Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "Grow Club" recognize Trump's inexorable power and start pulling their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the survey figures that show that the real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's sympathy ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth revealed that only two of the 10 Republicans were positive for this real estate magnate.
By mid-July, it was 40%.
At the beginning of August, this was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans are positive for Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are at the top of the list in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans were loyal to Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters would put Trump on the stand.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were to become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be upset if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be thrilled against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of exhilaration?
Marco Rubio, who's only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they'll be "unsatisfied" or "unsatisfied" if Jeb Bush's favorite establishment becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insulting, 52 per cent of Republican voters across the country think that the magnate has the right temperament to be president, as the ABC News/Washington post poll on Monday showed.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he's not the man who can be effective in office, and almost six of the 10 independent voters say that his temperament isn't good for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to it.
When they wear their master hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who the most likely winner of the GOP nomination was, four out of ten said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
It's not like that when four out of ten put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the previous cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that a large number of GOP voters find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to come together around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some scholars have pointed out that such a variation is likely to benefit Trump, while not supporting Trump is evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical "one-on-one" competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He's ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasic and Chris Christy by 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's gonna go around him?
Ben Carson beat a businessman to 19 points in a hypothetical "one-on-one" competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trump say they're sure of their votes.
Clearly, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with a fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapemakers" two months ago in his campaign speech, immigration has become the most relevant topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pose will turn key voters of Latin American origin away from the Republican party and prevent the rebranding.
But according to the ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts the attention of all, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from approximately half of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
One of the 10 Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll says they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended at Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activities in Congress, with 54 per cent "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "in anger."
The government will decide on the fate of pension indexation in October.
The Russian Federation Vice-Premier Olga Holodoc stated that the Government is now looking for options to enforce the Pension Indexation Act in 2016 to the real level of inflation, passing on to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, by the time of the submission of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, cabmin is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze Russian savings pensions.
The starving noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion roubles.
The same is true of the full pension indexation for the following year.
According to the Vice-Prime Minister, there is as yet no final solution to the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
A hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Previously, the media reported that the cabin considered two options for balancing government budgets.
Why is it often annoying and blushing eyelids?
Answered by the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levasov:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of blfarite ourselves.
The exit is simple:
Don't rub your eyes with your dirty hands, carry a special wet napkin for the century.
At least one or two times a day, purify the ends of the century from the harmful substances stored in them during the day.
The cleaning procedures should also be supplemented by warm herbs (shalphea, chamomiles), which create the thick secret of the salsa glands and then massage the edges of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of finger cushions;
do not use alcohol in making up.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further confound the secret of the salal glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclearists have created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities reported that the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity."
This was reported on the country ' s Central News Agency website.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the US "aggression and nuclear threat" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in both quantity and quality."
The North Korean authorities last tested nuclear weapons in 2013.
However, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that he managed to build an atomic warhead.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also tested medium- and short-range missiles on several occasions, writing polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the union of fraternal nations should be removed from the national anthem.
He stated that during the meeting of the State Duma, he reports "Russian News Service."
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it," Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that all four hundred of these lines should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the King," while Russian tricolor should replace the imperial flag, and he wrote political.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Asad is convinced that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
"That's what refugees are all about," he said in an RT interview.
We must continue the dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people are killed, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people are not fully safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Let us recall that about 500,000 migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the EU countries this year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world was the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of members of the extremist Islamic State group may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The people of the German city organized a holiday for the refugees.
In the past month, Germany had become a refugee reception leader, although it had recently strengthened border controls to contain the influx.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call the figures significantly higher.
Since early September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
The BBC correspondent, Jenny Hill, visited Darmstadt, where migrants receive a warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts the Prime Minister in the session.
After Mr. Corbin's election, his debut at the session is expected to be very much awaited by the Prime Minister
Jeremy Corbin, the new Labour leader, will be speaking to the Prime Minister for the first time in the session, taking advantage of David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six questions in the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some meetings by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbin ' s first parliamentary test as leader, following his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the Tread Junior Annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silent during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th Battle of Britain, provoked criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament, and became the subject of several cutting-edge articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the State anthem attracted attention.
Mr. Corbin's spokesperson stated that he had "stayed silently" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, a member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's shadow cabinet told Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbin ' s team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party ' s members supported him as leader.
BBC's political correspondent, Robin Brant, said that political differences would also be "shocked" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin's appointment to the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Junior Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party was "fully clear" that it was opposed only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from Pound26,000 to Pound23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Labour leader to meet David Cameron at the courier box in the last ten years since he became the Conservative leader.
The Labour Leader, who promised a different approach to politics, states that he "has attracted collective resources" to gather ideas for Mr. Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Aylington North District said that the Prime Minister's questions caused too much confrontation, and that he would refrain from brazen answers and the exchange of wands, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on issues of prime minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also suggested allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Berkow, to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of "marvelous balagan," often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s questions have become a key indicator of the leader ' s views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Shot in Johannesburg" Homeless young people who learned from photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for homeless people.
But a group of former street children found a way to master the trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Johannesburg" is a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of neighborhoods and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling increases as wages rise in Britain
The pound has grown with wages rising in the UK, with the FTSE 100 rising due to the offer to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, British earnings, less bonuses, increased by 2.9% over the same period last year.
The rate of growth has been the highest since 2009, and has been seen as a postponement of projections of possible increases in quotations.
The Pound sterling increased by more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84% against the euro, reaching Y1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
SABMiller's shares, which grew by 20% as a result of a purchase offer from AB InBev's competitor, were generally singled out.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewing companies, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stocks grew by 0.9% against encouraging news from a competing group of Richemont luxury goods.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Glencore's stock grew by 5% after the mining giant claimed to have been able to earn $2.5 billion by placing shares, which was done as part of the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's stock of paper and packaging materials was leading the decline in the index - by 4.3 percent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the band's rating to "sell."
The JD Sports stock grew after a sports clothing supplier company reported an 83 per cent increase in profits prior to taxation to £46.6 million in six months.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages may impede expansion.
Executive Director of JD Sports, Peter Caugill, says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
Costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could have reduced the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi's pressure.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attacks in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up bulk food supplier launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA's players in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of Aldi 700 million dollars to be injected by the company.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of the 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media and at Adelaide Show events.
Ritalers and IGA suppliers, such as Simmo's ice cream producer from Dunsborough, who offers tasting at IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell tickets to South Australia's football league matches at discounts to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about his protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will spend its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake, as IGA brand stores in South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known for their traditional routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA handlers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will cut off 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of his first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly independent routers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA's handlers may lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores next year in SA and 30 in WA, selling $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and food sales at a high constant cost of Metcash may cost the company about 13 million revenues before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat considers.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and that is, a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, Metcash sales are estimated to fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company ' s market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, a leading stock manager, Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noticed at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it's assumed that a member of Metcash's board of directors contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA ' s market share has declined from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash ' s food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA ' s handlers, have fallen by 43 per cent compared with 2012 due to operational deveritization and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up by spending more than $150 million annually to level retail prices with those of Coles and Woolworths on a thousand items weekly, helping IGA routers to re-engineer trading sites, and offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of brand foods.
Director General Metcash Ian Morris says that equalizing prices and renovating trading space is gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will increase net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Healy.
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirios and deserves more credit for his behavior than critics, as President Tennis Australia says Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented duet, often called "Special Ks," was unwittingly the focus of attention because of Kirios' shameful fight with Stan Wavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly afterwards, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge at the tower had to dislodge Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, and Harrison said, "The Vawrinka should have been put on Kiryos' scapegoats, and I should have put it on that guy's scapegoat."
Ever since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a convulsion in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat on US Open, Healy has been dedicated to protecting Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomić in solitary confinement in the mid-finals of the Davis Cup v. the United Kingdom.
"I'm really worried about one thing, the fact that Tanasi was involved in the conflict," said Healy.
He did break the racket when he had a leg on US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the racket when hopes broke, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at pretty provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's credible.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he fits into the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensely trained, he's in great shape, he's a very dedicated and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kirios for an important match starting on Friday, believing that a "win-win" would be the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the arguments around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Marray prove, he grows in front of the public, he makes some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of focus for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
By declaring a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who tried to enter the country illegally in order to contain the influx of migrants.
There was unrest at the border, with hundreds of migrants gathering in the border area, to which the Serbian authorities responded sharply.
Stuck indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their home country broke up tents and settled in the area.
However, resentment grew.
When a police helicopter was circling over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary "inadmissible" when more and more of them came from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral damage.
Negotiations should be held with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
Waves on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) under which the EU member States would receive an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded that next week an emergency EU summit be convened to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect swift action on the part of Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block the roads and speed up asylum trials.
Meanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dogata reported that even the prisoners had been connected to an emergency work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main "narrow" and border crossing point of the European Union for settlers, many of whom are refugees, victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister, Victor Orban, insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, rather than refugees, victims of war, who are entitled to protection, a view that is strongly at variance with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight now make it an offence to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison terms for accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of emergency," told journalists Zoltan Kovac, a government spokesman in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Reporters Associated Press, who are at the border, have been observing the presence of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Diard Bakondi, the national security adviser to Orban, reported that 45 persons had been caught by the authorized authorities trying to cross the border at the border itself and 15 others inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with administrative offences under the new laws.
The authorities are re-establishing the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven crossings at the border with Serbia, bringing a railway wagon with barbed wire to block one of the passageways.
Trouble broke out on the main passage through the border near the town of Ryoske, Hungary, because Hungarians had set up a service space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressured each other to break in.
Some 20 individuals were able to enter, with thousands remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced the rejection of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democrat race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among primary Democrats (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to take part in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 per cent of the primary Democrats.
More than five months before the competition began in the primary elections, the majority of the Democrats say that it is too early to say that they have decided with the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her male support has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for Democrats under 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month Clinton beat Sanders to a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary Democrats across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm for her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of primary Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same thing about their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that now is the time of the female president (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters are also talking about an association that links her to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It's also called consenting questions and the chances of being elected.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary Democrats would like him to join the race - although a third believes he should not.
When asked who they would like to be second among the party's candidates, the primary Democrats in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that they would have chosen Biden as second, which is more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democrats see Clinton as the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 per cent last month.
By this indicator, Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answer to the question of what is most important in the candidate, the Democrats choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, in the past month, none of the Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and credible people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton's strong side is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary Democrats do not see Clinton as honest and credible, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion about him.
The primary Democrats also generally consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be similar ideological views.
By all these standards, about a quarter of the Democrats have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton ' s personal e-mail box and server continue to be raised by her Secretary of State, most primary Democrats are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general perception of it.
But that's a different story for the American public at large.
Half of the Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, but only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over e-mail has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their views on it have deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered fair and credible by her party voters, it continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider it honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush show the best result in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as more honest than not, but as a Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democrats is 6 percentage points.
According to the national survey, Ben Carson was close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates won half the vote in the new poll, leaving the rest of them looking for support under their feet.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump, whose support rate increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS poll held prior to the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off during the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all population groups by crowding Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, went back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakaby, and Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6 per cent, which was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week revealed Carson's growth in the polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, for Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump to be well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's growing support last week, Trump made several critical attacks on a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a freshman at Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during a frat ritual in the Pokono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
"The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch New York College brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to take him to hospital in time, which led to his death," reported the police.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded and a 30-pound sand bag was pushed behind his back several times while he was trying to reach the goal, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng passed out, and they were waiting for an estimated hour before taking him to the hospital, and they're talking to the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask for advice, as police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"In this moment, the brothers began to hide their personal belongings, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained several blunt injuries to the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have suffered from fraternization rituals because at least one student dies every year since 1970," said Douglas Feierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in his statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step on the part of the authorities.
Monroe County juries have been inclined to be accused of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with rookie assault and conspiracy.
"We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but, if there is an organization that authorized all of this formally or informally, it is also," Wagner stated at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity removed the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There's gonna be higher rates, and the bull market will trip, bond yields will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna be before the offensive, and how long it's gonna last.
More specifically, for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came only 11 months after the first rate increase and 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The US Central Bank Administration therefore insists so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising stakes, but on how much adaptation will take.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around higher rates is exaggerated.
"The first increase in Federal Reserve rates with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the signal of the end of the cheap money era," reported Julian Jessop, the chief specialist in international economics in Capital Economics, in his commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react according to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, the expectation of higher rates could lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate rises, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
"It's not like the stock returns were slowed down by 12 to 24 months after the first race, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate increases.
More specifically, the market has changed sharply in the past about 35 years - about 14 per cent - upwards, remains fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (an average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal, with an average return rate of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the lead shareholder in the Nuveen Asset Management strategy published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to be immediately more pronounced at the rate-up stage, and the profits from shares are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often encouraged by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is subject to conditions that have not existed before and may accelerate the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at its lowest point in the life of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, rising rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual GDP of 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will last long, with only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
An increase in rates on such a volatile economic background can be risky and raises the question "will it be different this time" as reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve system all year, with their eyes tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy specialists and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in rates at this meeting, futures trade shows only a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all cycles of higher rates to date have been in the supercycle of a growing financial lever with GDP that overlaps the peaks leading to recession very quickly after recovery," says the report.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is the longest one that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession, with a record of 35 months, a total of 74 months and not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being sold for equity.
The policy difference is that bonds will have a faster effect than stocks when the federal system changes strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the bond returns are falling immediately," reports Deutsche.
Strategy specialists in Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring the return levels of long-term and short-term bonds closer together, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in this climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in returns," says a study by Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected policy outcomes of the Federal System.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the return curve is flatter, credit spreads have increased, volatility has increased - all market characteristics have increased, with the Federal System becoming more stringent.
Generally speaking, companies that run their business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts would be in a worse position, as the growing dollar made their products more expensive in the world market and their debt more expensive in the financial world.
"History shows that "qualitative" stocks show efficiency above the market within three months of the initial increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a client report.
Stable companies were bypassed by unstable companies as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-volatility shares, also showed better performance than low-quality shares by an average of 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.
The debt will become a big question.
Companies with a high interest rate of debt with floating rates will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ as to how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," claims Conservative member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "declining standards"
Proves she's getting less and less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just cut off from Brits.
A parliamentary colleague, Damien Collins, struck by The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of members of Parliament, encouraging the television and radio company to prove that it was doing something that commercial companies weren't doing.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, Andrew Bingham, also told the BBC leadership that it seemed that the public radio station was being "stupid" and was becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to me - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, look like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- here's two examples that came first to my mind, where you're actually just copying what's already in the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC's CEO rejected the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of his commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What Radio 3 gives me, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and music creation is really no longer equal to anyone else.
"It's also really very important, I think, Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract an audience than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only child of BBC who was attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tori Damien Collins, MP, attacked The Voice, a music show of talent that BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the BBC typical style.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time it launched the entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money by those who pay the licence fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and the fault may be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7 per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could have helped to contain the waste.
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are now signs of equalizing online sales after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online shopping in August has shown a minimal increase since it began recording in 2000, increasing by only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of equalizing online sales after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," told Guardian Andy Malcahi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming out on the platoon, and you can see a decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon that came from America is mentioned as one of the reasons why sales are slowing down.
Experts believe that buyers could have refrained from buying the day before the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers were five times as fast as the average to the computers as they could to take advantage of the good offers, thus destroying a number of sellers' websites.
Forensics think Black Friday, when the buyers are in a real race to buy, might have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over Pound1 is spent online out of every five pounds.
For goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold via Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims are buried when a crane falls in Mecca, and the Bin Laden family is sanctioned.
The Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead across the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims from everywhere flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mainly in white, present at the funeral, the carriageway was flooded to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed by a sacred place where a building crane had broken the ceiling of the mosque just a few days earlier and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, while King Sauditov fined a construction company belonging to the Bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who were killed in the crash of a crane at the Main Mosque were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children, Kasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrim trip when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left an arrow of a crane raised by a non-operational crane.
The Arabic version of the decree published by Saudi Press states that Binladin Group bears partial responsibility for the collapse.
The English editorial of the news agency did not mention the details, but reported that the company's leaders were not allowed to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why a crane had fallen in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had flocked to go to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Mecca Main Mosque, as part of the extensive construction work that Binladin Group does.
The bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia's closest ruling families for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaida's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a cheating son who was abandoned by the family in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimages, which are mandatory at least once in their lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased, the same amount irreversibly damaged.
The rest of the victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of small-cost Eastern European workshops
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Main City Correspondent, Daily Mail
They say the British put the hammer and paint brush in the direction and instead hire qualified Easterners to do the work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or how to paint walls, you seem to be outnumbered these days.
Because, according to the B&Q company, the British are still hiring professional masters to do simple housework.
Veronica Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home-building services, reported that this trend is followed by a substantial influx of skilled technicians from Eastern Europe offering services at a minimum price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in hardware, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by women of the weak sex.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends, characterized by an increase in the number of households made up of single women who were more engaged in housing than in the past, should not be overlooked.
Ms. Laurie said, "We still have male-dominated shops.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods to be purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women in charge of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team to equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of the managers are women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important question for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took over the cost of closing the shops, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales over the course of six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
United States Federal Reserve interest rate decision time
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, which, for two days, discusses the crucial decision to raise interest rates for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would delay and keep the rate at the current range of 0 to 0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as seven years have passed since the Federal Reserve lowered the bet to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to normal interest rates," said Angel Ubid, a leading employee of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy works well, the recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but they were convinced that they had every chance of not doing so.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!" by hundreds of refugees at the Khorgosh checkpoint at the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has blocked the border for settlers.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to search for other routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies across Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that were transporting refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the town of Shid on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojša Stepanović, assures us that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but that its capacity is limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia safe as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
But it's already a European problem.
It is not easy to solve, and no country in Europe can do it alone, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian premier Viktor Orban is determined:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Europe wants to help us.
Wangelis Meimarakis has been part of the center-right governments for a number of years, leading, according to the left, the country to a financial crisis.
Now, as interim leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist named Euronews.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by losing to the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, the New Democracy is as popular as it is.
What changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tzipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
The country now has again a fiscal deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Tzipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what really happened.
Daily life was markedly worse than in January, when the situation was improving, with the majority of Greek citizens.
But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including CIRIZ.
Wangelis Meimarakis: The point is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement a programme on which they have agreed without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tzipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new premier on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Wangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece on the European path, because we have a good idea of the disastrous consequences that a country ' s withdrawal from the EU would have had.
Europe is now helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tzipras' negotiating.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to bring order to power in the first year, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be a mistake to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to regain their confidence, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to benefit from EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras Government has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have learned by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Tsipras ministers never talked about it.
I mean, Greek ministers weren't trained and poorly informed, so they failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Junker, Olland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them differ from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, said to them?
Wangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement by bypassing its sharp corners.
We have moved reform forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was then the Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the majority of the Government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and that was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The past few weeks have seen a massive influx of refugees throughout Greece.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Wangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election victory.
And the reason is that the SIRIZA government has not acted as it should.
There is a need to be proactive in such matters, because if the problem comes to you, then only extraordinary measures remain.
And we're in this situation now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIZ did more in just seven days than Mr. Tzipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions by the interim Government, which is being given valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some of the extraordinary events that have taken place with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
A decision must be taken at the EU summit and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border controls and reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance that the EU receives in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Druzhkovka Donetsk province, for 24 hours, the criminal investigation officers of the Directorate-General of the Police of the Region, together with the military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who had been found by a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Krivoy Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who had shot his opponent with a gun the previous night during a drinking-coupling and a conflict in the village of Verkhnetorecki Yasinovat district of Donetchina.
A 22-year-old boy was reported to have been injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fire wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, Deputy Head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Regional Police Department, during the course of the operations, law enforcement officers proved that the figure was involved in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, which resulted in a fatal gunshot wound to the man ' s head.
Criminal proceedings have been opened under the Criminal Code of Ukraine by the Criminal Investigation Department of the Druzhkivsk State under the articles "Intentional murder" and "Intentional infliction of serious bodily harm."
The detainee is facing up to 15 years ' imprisonment.
The Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention centre and reported to the Donetsk province police press service.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in Ukrainian flag colours, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced to imprisonment by a Russian court.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
The prison population of Novosibirsk was sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons were restricted for 14 and 18 months.
The Leninsky Court of Novosibirsk found four of the citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin monuments, which were located on the premises of the RPNF Commune and on Trikotajna Street, as well as the memorial complex "Monution of Fame."
In the latter case, the Katyusha rocket and the T-34 tank were painted.
We will recall that on the night of 12 December, in Russian Novosibirsk, unknown persons painted the Ukrainian flag of military equipment on the Monument of Glory.
The civilian wife of popular Russian actor Evgeniy Gypsies Irina Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl appeared at one of Moscow's clinics.
Newborn and her mom are feeling good.
Let's remind you that recently the Gypsy and Leonov broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition.
Eugenia Gypsyoff is 36 years old.
He is an actor in Moscow's Master Petra Fomenko Theatre.
He is known for the films "The Walk," "Space as a Premonition," "The Brest Fortress," "Ottel" and "Farza."
On September 8, Yevgeny Gypsynov was recognized as "Acter of the Year" and "Man of the Year" in the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "sorry" about the first murder and would like to "take it all back" to the authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, report that a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
Monday night, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there was a dog in the house that would "no one hurt" but probably upset.
The police asked about the caller's name, but he didn't name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
By writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by police, killed himself.
The president of William Laforge University reported that he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite the information on Monday that Lamb had an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that there was "no information or evidence" of the "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a daughter who's 19, and that she's "unsatisfied."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, who the San Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home online.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she was dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday at some point to say that "he's not going to jail."
The same night, when the police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in pedagogy from the University of Delta in the spring of 2015.
Stars Who Lost their Success
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-term life partner, Farru Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this has certainly played its part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United left for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champion League match, where Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While counsel is concerned about this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless pod on the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV's penalty zone.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or the day after and then operated on.
It's awful - a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties, and started to play fantastic, and it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and a guy can't play in a group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and wasn't sentenced.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
In his Twitter account, Shaw says, "Thanks to everyone for your messages, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll come back even stronger than I was."
On the subject of Manchester, the United has had an accident with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV.
The English protector will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Coke, PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious injury."
When any player leaves with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to traumatize the enemy.
Moreno suffered a fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him right now, because he had no intention of hurting his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you're not feeling well," Coca said.
I wasn't able to see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Morino) touched it, but I didn't see a hit on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear it.
It's really hard, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Loraces?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it's gonna take a little while before you get to know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question by the representative of the children's vacation company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Loraks, an environmental story written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on SuperCamps' website, and goes, "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we're missing."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of a 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high walls of the city of Allnujville, where there was no greenness and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of her dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suze (the real name Theodore Suze Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a short story of the film "Lorax," posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of Allnugville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girls of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, who is generally recognized as an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by a greedy tree cutter and a "all-wearer" binder, Nahodkins, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name appears in the title of the book), a ridiculous creature with a mustache that "spokes on behalf of the trees."
It is likely that such a simple PR assignment was entrusted to an artist who had never read to a child a Loraks book 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text had allegedly been received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron headquarters, but no further comments were received.
For Adam, there was obviously a risk of not getting into England's team, but it's still a difficult question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England chose for this tour, repeating the 3-0 test series that happened last time doesn't seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players among the thugs who virtualize the balls and collective thinking strong; they don't bring the scars from 2012, but only the youthful positive.
With Moin Ali's ball, he turns into a ball bowler, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attack option.
On another subject: Adam Lit left England's test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to exclude Adam Lit is, of course, difficult for me, his main coach in Yorkshire.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, but the obvious reality is that cricket players are assessed by judges.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) players are the best to choose themselves.
A couple of semi-sottens, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
We hope that if he pulls more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief coach of England's team, Trevor Bailiss, spoke well of his attitude, even when he didn't show what he could, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it's gonna take before the Batsman test cricket gives itself an impression is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, just like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play his own and someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's the Batsman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricket player, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he made 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but it will certainly depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening bat, which would allow for an additional spinner, keeping four speed bowlers, is thinking about it, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see why a beating player can't hit the ball there, and that left-handed guy has already shown that he's a damn good cricket player.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his county Woostershire, but he's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test games with the third Batsman before opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my brief conversation with him, he seemed to me to be a very promising young man.
People can look at his indicative statistics -- on average, 31 bats and 35 balls -- and think it's a risky bet, but there's not a lot of pros among the spinners, and they choose youth.
He's gonna learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coach.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardine, a Sri Lankan Batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a workshop.
He's one of the best guys for the game that's gonna bring her the best experience she's ever had, under all possible conditions and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the net.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coach, and, like Mahela, had a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what was said earlier, can give new power to the team.
Collie's teammate, Darema Ben Stokes, is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in Australia, and I have no problems with that, for example.
Although not everyone will agree, coaches and players do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
A camp of supporters of Britain's EU withdrawal can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron's ill-advised policy to resume negotiations on keeping Britain in the EU every day has become increasingly difficult, even without looking back at the election of the brilliant Jeremy-"Is that yes or no?"- Corbin's Labour Leader or TUC's anger about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained during the days that, given the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them itself - some of the participating countries are fed up with the British egocentric agenda of divisive concessions and undermining the agreement on changes that they do not generally want.
Having gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that he wouldn't want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie program.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance skate through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against a known local monument, at or without a local celebrity company, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European buddy, who wants to be interested in having external contacts with Britain under a European Union tent - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that foreign ministers and officials in some capitals should get to the bottom of it when they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens for her, as she has deteriorated for those who have been sitting in her seat thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kola (16).
The head of France, François Hollande, is standing before re-elections or replacements in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It's hard to see them licking out of their skin to help the "selfi Brits" whose energy could have been spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarts during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to encourage Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea fiction" and "The Britain has received nothing of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical media magnats are towards the EU, unlike the time of Tony Benn's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a hard-core Euro opportunist who was famous for his "direct EU bananas" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a bunch of scared crooks, foreign phone hackers and non-resident pseudo-residents who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but realized that when you were in a cage with a violent gorilla, you had to give her some bananas to distract her and keep her from eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair was to Cameron's idea of a referendum, because Blair was in favour of the European Union's repealed constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But the dear Jeremy Corbin who slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't have time to spend it on me - seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnok's strategy of the '80s Murdock Boycott - a mistake both then and now.
It might take time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with the press - not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, whose couch he sat on on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I call evolution delicately.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people outside of Ukip's tribalist trend and a wider circle of small England's tories may say yes.
It's the same as Hilary-Bann, but not Bennett-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, and his internal Boy Scout refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of the insufferable John McDonnell as Shadow Secretary of Finance was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old dad fought hard on TV for his lack of loyalty to his Labour colleagues without going too far or losing his office in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the fight to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, nor what J.C. said to the Parhams and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, according to everyone.
Whatever the Democrat and his "boyfriend" Corbin-- remember, he touched even me-- the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24/7 television, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's main misconception about EU membership - within the bennite economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, born of minor differences, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson - it is unshakeable that J.K. will not campaign for his exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on British concessions when it may be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak British military actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tori government is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the public health England e-cigarette review
A government-funded agency stated that 95 per cent less harmful than smoking was heard at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report, the "turning milestone" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts to the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on the basis of which PHE built its main opinion.
In an article by the BMJ, two other researchers questioned whether these statements had "hard or loose reasons."
Martin McKee, a professor of European health care at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: "The fundamental principle of health care - rules must be based on proof of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on detailed evidence review and modelling.
In fact, this is taken from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criterial analysis of decision-making to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes without mentioning the funding he was reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
No reasonable explanation was provided for the selection of the board members, but there are several known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom have also indicated funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by a tobacco director at PHE.
The scientific article published by the group "accepts" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the harmful effects of most products according to most criteria" was written by McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell reported that PHE's statements that "there is no evidence at this time that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or not smoking" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's statements had previously been answered.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two who smoked his whole life died of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not proven, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and NHS costs £2 billion a year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only cause part of the harm caused by smoking, we are doing our job for the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 thinks BBC should stop EastEnders.
Luke Johnson, former head of Channel 4, believes that the BBC should stop producing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give much for successful shows such as the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson observed that licence fees should only be used to create programmes that are not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service broadcasts, which are probably watching only a small part of the audience, at a peak airtime when competitors have a high-rated show, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noticed that he had in his time for six years unsuccessfully tried to cooperate with BBC while working on Channel 4.
"I can't help but think that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programmes that could be shown by competing companies that don't receive grants," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of a search for the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should only keep on air those programs that are not and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show is aired in the prime plot because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why retrogressive taxes should finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give up a lot for her.
I don't understand how this could be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would somehow lower the BBC.
A serial entrepreneur named Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of chasing ratings "because of employees' ambitions and their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support."
His comments on the most popular BBC show are resonated with those of Executive Director Sky Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh invited BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson observed that the more low-cost BBC public broadcasts "continued to go to BBC4 where it is often impossible to assess the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be argued in the phantom sermons that justify income from four billion pounds of license fees: "Well, yes, of course, we make all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more retrogressive system as to who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder if that's what they think because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
David Elstein, former executive director of Sky and Channel 5, who also addressed the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review Rit's mission in favour of "information, education and entertainment."
He noted that only a small part of BBC production was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio content - and that the company had to take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan "information, education and entertainment."
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade concerts" (only some of which he said were shown on TV), as well as join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them accessible online.
"Sonogenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows nematodes changing direction as they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they're exposed to sonic impulses too high for the human ear to hear.
Pulses are influenced by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Another topic: Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists have explained that worms demonstrate the potential of a new methodology called "sonogenetics," which is based on the use of ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart, and muscles, with the source of ultrasound located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a researcher at Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and uses it to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that they started reacting when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles were boosting ultrasonic waves, which then infiltrated worms.
Strong ultrasound waves affect structures called the "Ion Channel TRP-4" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and trigger the cells associated with them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani has genetically modified worms, so their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound for exposure to modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms, activated by modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics," a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and turn off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that there may be advantages to sonogenetics compared to this method.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right part of the brain through the fibre, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the body's tissues without difficulty, so you don't have to go inside the skull box to deliver them.
"We believe that the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical settings," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin producing cells.
The forbidden torture equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertisements bully the British arms trade
See Amnesty International for protest against the arms show.
Amazing killer drones!
Iron shackles that break the tibia!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light noise truncheons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
A awake voice and a painted animation leave no doubt that this commercial for the largest international arms exhibition is a food parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to "throw" weapons to repressive regimes, using the defence technology and security system exhibition at the ExCeL Center in Doclands.

But a special campaign also leads to the sudden emergence of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that demand to be looked at again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from September 15 to September 18th?" is written on one of them in the fonts of the London subway with an image of the DLR line becoming a silhouette tank.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will arrive at the DLR line, and passengers are asked to help prevent the arms show.
300 posters were painted by artists who put their work out at the Museum of Rough Design in Benxie's Dismalland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a six-pound set of wrench keys, which is said to be "accessing about a third of the advertising space at the world's bus stops."
London's transporters weren't happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, Cruel Designs curator and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seek to bring political art to an audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.

Amnesty's video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, a pro bono agency with graphic designer and voice artist, who also work free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was struck by the advert's silence around the arms exhibit - with an ExCel pass - and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and cunning corporate commercial, but "to fill her house with bright flowers and animation turned out to be a more exciting exercise."
"They have been incredibly helpful in drawing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now we need the British government to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art about the arms exhibition comes from inside the ExCeL, where participants sell fantastic euphemism products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about an order for "AT4CS RS to shoot from the shoulder" from the U.S. Army.
It includes "a non-affiliated cumulative weapon that produces an unprecedented armored action inside the target."
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm as a normal 19-year-old man still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the long smiles of those I've annoyed - and the many, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I've learned can be divided into eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can vary from a slightly nervous one to a completely scary one.
He encourages you to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you took an academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you supported Corbin, and why you "honestly, I don't love or hate Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast HAHAHA extract, I'll be in my room."
Take a break.
And help others take a break too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People ' s rooms are often turned into drinking houses, midnight cinemas and places of common party, but they are also a place where people dress and correct their underwear.
Another topic: Don't even think about starting university while in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a shelter, but many dormitories form a culture of twitching from room to room, which promotes friendship, communication and long friendships.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to rebuild.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I've spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communicating - not knocking on him, but sending text messages.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorm followed that principle: if the door wasn't locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baked food.
Since you're starting a university life at the height of the Bake-off show, knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies isn't that weird, it's not like the 1950s with "Welcome, we're neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I'm gonna ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade meals is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to sleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to get some milk for tea?
You can do it with the milk owner.
He's probably gonna ask you not to be shy, even if it's boiling with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I feel sorry for you, but try to be more mature about it than my roommate, who poured dishes into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're those people from the glass house saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her roommate to reduce the sound of the drum and bass guitar because she had a 3:00 a.m. exam and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor responded by increasing the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she kindly let him sleep for two hours, and then she got her music and locked the door behind her when she went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband lived in the same dorm as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be extreme, until you bit your elbows, clumsy, if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got into it, broke up the relationship, and should have seen him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your mutual friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool your own heat a little bit.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the prank and the harassment is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but don't ever dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water that you're gonna put in the freezer, but don't stick someone else's stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after the Apple update has been released
You can request a new operating system from the Settings application, choose the General, and then select the Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some faced problems after installation when a bug report came in, telling them that "updating the application failed."
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait until the recovery has subsided or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to complete the process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of the action by reducing the update and also simplified the implementation by means of a special tool that proposes to delete the applications and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
It is worth checking that your phone is loaded or near the charger when updating to prevent battery discharge.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded by telephone to Russia's military activity.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support provided by Moscow to President Assad only exacerbated the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague about it, writing PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported in PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Al-Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal of combating extremism - unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power," the representatives of the United States Department of State said.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US commitment to fighting the Islamic State within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad would never be able to be a member.
In addition, the US "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in confronting the Islamic State."
Last Friday, White House representatives stated that they did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, the White House Press Secretary, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin would be beneficial to our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime as a "loser bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result the situation worsened," the President of the United States said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant amendments to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported this to Izvestam.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Trans-Russian Development, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Security Service, FCS and Rostourism - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
Experts, in turn, note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about 200 million annually go to European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes, providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on yachts imported and other floating means for rest and sport.
In the Ministry's view, this would certainly contribute to creating an enabling environment for the development of the yachting in the coastal zones of the country, as Lashkin pointed out.
The issue had been brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs, Tariff, Non-Tariff Regulation and External Trade Protection of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which had met in September, and had also been endorsed by the authorities.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure of full conditional release on import is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EEC, explained Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in the fields of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In the press service of Mintrans of the Russian Federation, Izvesteam reported that they had prepared binding regulations on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provided for simplified procedures for the entry and exit of small, sports sailing and pleasure craft at the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure that small, sports sails and pleasure craft enter the seaport and leave the seaport in a simplified manner.
The Ministry has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the Russian Federation for the approval of the boundaries of the maritime ports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been issued, and the rest are in the process of being agreed upon - the press office of the department noted.
According to Mintrans, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out State supervision, classification and inspection, and State registration for small craft used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia, it's because of the poor infrastructure that makes yachting extremely difficult.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, it's a whole ever-growing industry that involves a lot of people.
In Russia, however, everything is in place.
Our coast is not an interesting, single piece of yachts that can be exploited year-round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Glenjik, Novorossi and Anapa.
But the big problem is that in this area, the border police's very strict rules are that a lot of permits have to be processed to get out on the yacht.
Besides, inside Russia, there's no place to refuel.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where she can take it, says Nordmarine Denis Novikov's sales director.
With regard to yacht storage facilities, there are currently special yacht hangars up to 30 metres in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also being sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich, but with the onset of the crisis, demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has allocated $500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the report states.
Zimao Fan, Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, said that reforms in the banking sector would help to revive credit in the real economy and stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and were witnessing first signs of stabilization in the World Bank.
But because of the seriousness of Fan's problems, the Ukrainian Government is calling for faster reforms.
Previously, the Polish government approved the loan of 100 million Ukraine, transferring to RIA News.
There are requests for separate units for transgender persons in prisons.
At the Public Council of the Federal Penal Correction Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons in October 2015, among other matters, the possibility of establishing separate units for transgender and transvestites in colonies will be discussed.
Izvestam told Councilman Vladislav Grib about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex offenders in Russia, it was possible to establish separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many) a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is only possible to determine the sentence of citizens to be served in such isolated places after the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a person of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
He said that the proposed practice worked well abroad: the SIZO (where the accused were in pre-trial detention) had separate cells for transgender persons and the correctional facilities had special units.
Today, it's the only way to deal with criminals like that.
There is a clear need to isolate them, as the presence of transvestites and transgender persons in conventional cells is dangerous for them, and it is suffering for their families and a sea of trouble for FIN personnel.
The humiliation of transes by cellmates is guaranteed, " says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with an uncertain gender, you have to count on where to distribute them.
SIZOs are definitely not needed - only cells, cells in prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgender people.
According to Grib, the unit may contain 50 or 100 persons, and if a specialized unit is established in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners will be able to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in remand centres at the place where the crime was committed, so that the admission of transvestites or transgender persons from other entities during the investigation and trial is not feasible, but the introduction of such a practice for convicted persons in a separate colony - yes - considers that the Grib.
On the previous day, law enforcement officials had been unable to determine in which detention centre, male or female, a 24-year-old transsexual Dmitri Kojokov (known as Alina Davis) had been detained for possession of drugs, which had resulted in the arrest of a man with a girl ' s appearance.
He was released from his home on a travel ban.
This news has been widely discussed on social media networks and the media, as the mechanism for holding transgender persons in remand centres and colonies in Rosia is not yet in place.
Russian human rights defenders, LGBT activists (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseyev supported the idea of creating special places to serve sentences with transgender people, noting that it was also possible to define people in colonies abroad, whether male or female, according to their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just as there's a question of security for homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseyev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
However, Alekseyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to pretend to be transsexuals in order to get into a different colony than the usual.
Of course, a medical examination can be introduced before placing people in transgender colonies, but it's not always the same.
For example, in the U.S., one of Chelsea Menning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the sex, " says Alexei.
A man can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison officers will be serious about the safety of such people and will be sensitive to their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual criminals in the colony could greatly delay the commencement of sentences by convicted prisoners.
A commission is being set up - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists carry out long-term observations, not one test on which to make a high-quality assessment.
Today's psychiatry capacity allows that.
Therefore, and before a change of sex, potential patients always undergo such tests - they clearly show whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, " says Lord Kipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to see how this system can be implemented with respect to convicted persons, since it takes an average of one month.
The doctor, while generally supporting the idea of separate units for transsexuals, also doubts whether it would be appropriate under the current economic conditions to allocate funds for the construction of new premises and medical examinations - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to estimate that there is no official statistics, but given that there are about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, it can be said that there are even fewer transgender people and that there are very few perpetrators of such a deviation and crimes, Lord Kipanidze said.
At the request of the colony administration, homosexuals and transgender persons can already receive separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipov won the Junior World chess Championship.
In Hunty Mansiysk, the World chess Championship ended at the age of 20.
The end of the first line was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became the Russian Michael Antipov, who was able to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kshishtof Doudou, who seemed to have come to the title with confidence.
The girls were defeated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Bux.
The World Chess Championships, held in Hunty-Mansiisk from the beginning of September, seemed to have lost almost all of their intrigues, as the Polish representative Jan-Kshysztof Duda, who had issued a series of four winners (the Swiss 13-round competitions), was confident to take over the leadership.
Given that the Duda was the first-ever ranking, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the cut seemed very low.
And even when Duda reduced his turnover and allowed the Russian Michael Antipov to reduce his backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the title struggle.
After all, Antipov had to win the 13th round in order to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Dooda your party.
Plus, this compulsory victory, of course, could affect the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He did well with Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for his party to complete the Dud meeting with Benjamin Bock.
Luckily for Antipov, the Polish chess player reduced the confrontation with the Dutchman to nothing.
So Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible points, but Antipov had the best additional scores.
It is for him, therefore, that the leadership of the Hunty-Mansi Autonomous Region, whose Governor, Natalia Komarova, has traditionally devoted much attention to the development of chess in the region, has won the main prize.
There was no intriguing ending in the girls' competition.
The leader of the tournament - Natalie Boukse (Ukraine) - to win the title, it was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
So Alina Bivol's Russian victory prevented her from catching up with the Books.
The Russian athlete was the second one left behind with 0.5 points behind the championship.
Whispering changes the regional structure.
The company brings the Volga and Ural regions together into one consolidated Volge-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As pointed out by Vimpelcoma's CEO, Michael Slobodin, changes are being made to "stay a strong player in the market" and to develop a company "in a new, not always favourable external environment."
In an interview with Russia 24, Mr. Slobodin specified that they intended to reduce the "ten percent" of staff in Russia.
Rosbranadzor checked the 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam highway had been fined 50,000 roubles, and the facility on Greater Tula Street had been closed for 90 days but had resumed work after all the irregularities had been corrected.
Forty-three diners violated the requirements for the accommodation.
Among other violations, poor sanitation and hygiene facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, bacteria from an intestine stick group were found in some facilities.
The franchise for the Burger King brand is owned by Burger Ruz, the owner of Alexander Kolobov's Chocolate Network, and has 293 diners in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency opposed the 10 per cent indexation of freight tariffs and the grant of State grants, as requested by the FAS.
At first, they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multibillion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansion, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its own "more stringent" proposals, which were currently under discussion in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a full-$300 million bond deal, reported by the gold company.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the value of the shares in favour of Sumeru and the market quotations) that can be taken from the free flow of money.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or demand extra payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project Kyzyl in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of Housing, reported that the Ministry, together with the Central Bank, was developing a procedure for the sanitation of developers.
"We understand that this is not going anywhere, so we're developing an appropriate mechanism," said the official.
The screenplays of Citizen Kane will be put on the market.
The representatives of the auction house Profiles in History announced plans to tender black versions of the film "Civil Kane," which is considered to be one of the best works of director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will start in the city of Kalabas on 29 September, with three black versions of the script, with an estimated value of $20,000 to 30,000 each, and will be transmitted to AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final version of the film.
Minpromtorg: Targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
Viktor Evtukhov, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be an analogy to the food distribution card system of the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate the word "food card."
I would like to point out in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the end of the total deficit of the time, the distribution card system, where the quantity of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if approved, we will propose changes to the law," TASS says Mr. Evtukhov.
I previously wrote that a programme to introduce food cards for the poor had been introduced into the Government.
For more information on the Minpromtorgue initiative, read "I" by Igor Shuvalov to prepare food cards.
The president of Rosgosstrah wants to divorce his wife.
A familiar source informed RAPSI that Danil Hachaturov, President of the Rosgosstrakh Insurance Company, had filed a claim with the Moscow Court for the dissolution of the marriage with designer Uljana Sergienko.
The trial of the Justice of the Peace No. 100 will commence on 16 September.
Danil Hachaturov requests that his marriage be dissolved and that the joint property be divided.
The court confirmed that there was a suit for divorce in the proceedings, noting that no claim for division of property had been filed and would be heard in the District Court.
President Alexander Bobresov is leaving his post.
The Vice-President of the Russian Railways (RZD) for Corporate Security, Alexander Bobresov, leaves the company, reports to Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-Prime Minister of Russia, Arkadius Dvorkovic, chairman of the Board of Directors of the RZD, stated that the issue of the withdrawal of Alexander Bobresov from the RZD had been initiated by the new head of Oleg Belozerov.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, the staff changes in the management of the RZD are not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, I reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakunin, the RZD was the first deputy transport minister, Oleg Beloser, who was in charge of the financial block.
The new head of the company announced for the first time reforms in the monopoly: in a year and a half, a new freight tariff system would be established.
For more information on the changes in the company, read "I" in "RZD will rewrite the price tags."
This year's study by the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" comes out for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year ' s ratings.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for the current year ' s ratings and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the original candidates is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would usefully be added to the pool of candidates.
The following executives of the company ' s functional areas may be nominated: the Director of Finance, the Director of Marketing, the Director of Staff, the IT Director, the Director of Public and Corporate Relations, the Director of Government Relations, the Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert ' s proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
The candidates are nominated on the basis of the sectoral classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and timber processing, engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-disciplinary holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer goods services and production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, finance, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a logo and password to access www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the remaining participants and can rank their estimates against the proposed criteria for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the principle of Best Choices: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle provides the best possible assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final outcome of the rating shall be approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year ' s ratings and multiple candidates for the previous years ' ratings are invited to face-to-face expert commission meetings.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of top managers and eight commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
It is proposed that the expert commission meetings approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the places are maintained strictly according to the Internet assessment and are classified information prior to the publication of the rating) or update them according to the attached roster of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are in accordance with the Russian language and Y standards.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfort rate for investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimated that the small and medium-sized business credit market had been 40 per cent in January-April of the current year.
What is your estimate of the situation today?
Since the panic of the end of 2014 and early 2015, HCC lending has declined significantly.
The reason is understandable: sharp increases in interest rates.
Credit for 25-30% of the year was unprofitable to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to put up all its problems in the future, from delay to non-return, it is not possible to do so now: the stakes are already cloudy.
For business, the current level of HCC lending rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of cost recovery.
A rate of 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
What is your estimate of how much business demand for credit is met?
The situation has improved slightly since the CDC's decline in interest rates.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients have begun to apply for loans much less frequently.
First and foremost, business does not understand its development prospects and future revenues.
Today, business has one option: it is necessary to learn to work on the basis of today ' s economic situation in the country and region.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely, to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows companies to make products more competitive and to keep businesses even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the HCC lending market that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast of lowering the average rate will depend to a large extent on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator is now showing consistency in lowering the key rate.
However, a drastic fall in the credit price for the HCC is not to be expected.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem that makes higher interest rates necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high, even if the BC's rates are reduced.
In terms of the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, which are limited both in their ability to replenish money and in their options for adjusting economic behaviour, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how Mazda's word is written with Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
And so is the new crossover CX-5, as is any other model of the brand: unbelievablely attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
It is simply because of its "Japaneseness" that Japan can bring its attachment to the products of the rising sun country to a state of complete admiration.
You can argue for cars from other countries as much as you want, and a person would even agree to these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation would be torn apart by the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology, but all other Japanese things.
To quote from Base's move, to send food to Wasabi, to collect katanas and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but in the canons of Japanese street fashion - nice, creative and quite unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniforms are the only form that girls enjoy after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is a radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the shape of the car is much more changed by the new pattern of headlamps and rear lamps, by which the car can be immediately identified in the traffic.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, and the shapes are sensitive, but the appearances are very strict.
We don't have to call the police.
When driving CX-5, one of the safest in the world, only stoic Japanese calm can be experienced.
A 2.2 L diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
The engine ' s fuel consumption of 175 l s is only 5.9 l. The powertrain shall be equipped exclusively with an automatic transmission and a complete transmission.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add some black humor to this image, you can select the leggings with a pint from the Not Cross police tape.
In Mazda, however, they did their best to keep you from being at the scene of your own car accident.
To further improve comfort while maintaining excellent steering, the suspension has modified the design of the front and rear depreciators, as well as optimized the shape of the arm of the front lower levers.
The full drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and engine noise levels at high speeds have been reduced by 13%.
The flower or stripe is as boring as the budget sedan.
That's not the case if a girl's in a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the role-playing genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, which provides the optimum space for both the broad shoulders and the long legs - who has it.
The long-legged ones will surely appreciate the fact that the pins in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and don't hit the ankles in the virgins.
The largest set of active security systems for Mazda is offered at CX-5.
Radios, lasers and cameras are used to detect potential threats.
There's adaptive lighting here, and a warning of a break from the lane, and monitoring of dead areas, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
It is suitable, with a minimum of protrusion, to contain a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are arranged in a 4:2:4 ratio, each section being fitted with a separate forward-gear, and increasing the luggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The hero's costume in Japan is called "kigurumi."
It's especially funny to look like pajamas.
There's everything in it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But also to entertain little kids.
Or just walking around like that on the street...
I mean, it's so great to be able to choose a cool dress, a manner of behavior, or a car.
Thank you for helping us prepare the Kawaikat store.
Kiev ripped the atomic union apart.
Kiev officially documented Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the pre-construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
Verkhovna's been happy on Wednesday since the second attempt, though, to vote for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, Ukraine ' s Verkhovna Rada adopted a law that terminates the 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation on the construction of a third and fourth block at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Government had been able to pass the bill only from the second ballot, for the first time with 210 deputies, with a minimum of 226 members, and then 234 members of Parliament had voted in favour of the draft.
The Kmelnitsky nuclear power plant under the USSR was originally designed to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER-type reactors, but only two had been built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the development led to an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Rada passed relevant legislation.
Since no funds were available in Ukraine ' s budget, it was assumed that blocks would have to be built on a Russian side ' s loan, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup d ' état in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry by announcing a refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnit nuclear power plant and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship remained was Russian fuel purchases for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as the Ukrainian NEC "Energoate" has so far no substitute for Russian supplies.
The plans for the completion of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finally abandoned: as early as 2014 in Kiev, they announced negotiations with Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Gensek is opposed to the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," gives AP his answer to the question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Foreign Ministry of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of Staff Nikolai Bogdanovsky of the Russian Armed Forces reported that General Staff did not preclude the establishment of a future air force base in Syria.
So far, no such plans have been made.
"But anything may be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, JT reported that the US did not trust Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist group Islamic State, banned in the Russian Federation.
For more information on U.S. doubts about Russia's aid to Syria, read "I" in "Russian Military Presence in Syria Worried by Washington."
The OSCE PA reports a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quoted Mr. Gerasimov's words.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and for "a return to the normal functioning of our countries."
Asked whether he believed that dialogue between Ukraine and Russia was now possible at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the contact group format at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov observed that the dialogue had taken place and that there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, politicians have said that in Kiev they support all kinds of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics had not changed their positions in the tripartite talks in principle, but the tone of dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod Electoral Commission summarized the results of the municipal elections by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates, which were organized according to party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been made by representatives of the RPF who accused them of "covering fraud."
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the Communist Party of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the cancellation of rents for the renovation of multi-family homes.
The municipal election results for Nizhny Novgorod ' s municipal constituency were officially presented by the city birch.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the electoral rolls in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voters were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were declared invalid.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the "One Russia" lists, the six deputies in the pride are Dmitri Swatkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteriev and Igor of the Nagorno.
The sole mandate of LDPR was given to the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the RPNF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the deputy of the State Duma, Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "A Fair Russia" are for Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
It is now up to these candidates to decide within five days whether they will serve as deputies in the City Duma: if they relinquish the mandate, they will move to the next candidate in the Parts List.
The Chairman of the Gorizbirkom, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the Commission that he was on duty to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" in order to avoid mandates.
During the adoption of the election report, the representatives of the RPF stated that there had been numerous irregularities.
Mr. Leonid Krasnokutski, a member of the Gorizbirkom with the right of consultative vote of the RPCF, suggested that the result of the voting in the four districts No. 21-24 should not be recognized, recalling that the entrance to the administration building, which had four district commissions, had been closed by order of the head of administration of the Sorm district.
Members of Gos Udma, candidates themselves and observers were unable to pass for a long time inside, and a high-profile storm on the gates of the Regional Administration was broadcast on television.
All observers and members of commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend meetings of the district commissions.
It was only when the voting had ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived that their ballots had been cancelled.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and interested persons could attend all the meetings," a member of the mountains of Natalia Andrušina was paralysing.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building, for more than four hours, the deputy of the Zak Assembly of Ludmila Aristov region was illegally detained, and a complaint was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also complained that in a number of UCKs, on election day, the boxes began to be sealed between 6 and 7 a.m. with ballot papers for early voting.
In doing so, the members of the commissions, with the right of consultative vote and observers, had not been notified, so they had already arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, ballot papers could have been thrown into the ballot boxes without control.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, had found no irregularities in throwing unrecorded ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of Maria Popova, a colleague from "A Fair Russia," to amend regional legislation by means of an oscillation to make it clear when the envelopes with the early ballot papers would be opened, which would then enter the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, contact the CEC," advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman was exposed to high-profile accusations by RPF member Sergei Samohin, who screamed that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered for electoral fraud.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful!" the chairman of the zerkoma was offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
Before 27 September, the general results of the elections are to be approved, followed by the first meeting of the sixth town Duma of Nizhny Novgorod within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the municipal electoral commission denied the political party Russian Communists the registration of an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties intended to discuss two issues: whether they agreed that the fees for the renovation of multi-family housing should be "immediately lifted" and the tariffs on housing and utilities "freeze by 2020."
However, Irene Maslov's lawyer explained that the appeal by the Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
The proceeds of FedEx are mixed, with a decrease in projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the fall in demand for freight and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that they would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares were reduced by approximately 2.5 per cent in pre-bidding 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it planned to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which was 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
The analysts assumed $10.84 according to FactSet.
The decrease in the forecast is despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in surface freight charges for heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the previous year, owing to lower expenditures, higher gross revenue and increased online trade.
The Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company had been "stable in terms of weak economic conditions, especially in production and world trade," compared to the forecast.
Employment plans for the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly the same as they had recruited last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 per cent over the year before.
The share income was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share conducted by the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international urgent transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross revenue in its express transport unit.
However, the boom in Internet purchases dramatically improved the results on the FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land-based revenue increased by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs of major departures and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned a higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher labour costs.
In pre-bidding, about an hour before the FedEx stock exchange opened, it fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 per cent a year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most anticipated meeting in several years, the Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table of Honduran red wood, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the richly decorated two-floor meeting room, a wall image of the United States would hang over them.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve system, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from Congress to maximize employment in the US and keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten commission: financial stability.
And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is prepared to move away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show strong economic growth, recent shocks in world financial markets can deter already cautious Federal System leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate for federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Pieggs, chief economist of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself causes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, while the key indicator shows only an estimated 30 per cent chance of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the federal system raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the blow with a promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The attack was triggered by expectations that the leaders of the Federal System's strategy would leave this week's bet," said John Lonski, the chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It'll be a surprise if the federal system raises the stakes at this point in time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve does so, "they will have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed to be tending to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected a higher rate this year, despite complaints by liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and at almost the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
Wage increases show signs of acceleration.
And, while inflation continues to fall below the central bank ' s annual target of 2 per cent, the Federal System stated that the key reason was the temporary impact of the oil price collapse.
The economy "can also cope with higher rates and needs them, given the declining labour market," observed Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average for industrial stock fell by as much as 16 per cent in a relatively high amount in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy might hamper global growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the May high.
For the management of the Federal Reserve, market disturbance makes it even more difficult to calculate the timing of interest rate increases.
"In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would turn the nuts at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
He predicts that they will be waiting for at least a month to gain more control of the consequences.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what the impact on the American economy might be, and they have little reliable data after the recent events in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "placify" its monetary expansion caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system would not only follow developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process - "art rather than science" - was noted by Zachary Karabell, director of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve of overreactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic principles."
Laker, a member with voting rights of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, " notwithstanding the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US," Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System cancelled these cuts.
The federal reserve system should focus on stability only in times of major crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to find yourself in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because markets are in shock," said Pozen, President of the Peterson World Economy Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of events.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.
The market/warehouse is a store where everything can be bought at once, offering dizzy choices of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian appetizers, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and public decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store is huge, and it's gonna take more than an hour to comb all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The culinary department in the store (good and cheap) is close to the cash register and offers various take-out options.
What's proposed: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Prices of goods are reasonable and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include delicacy Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is as varied as the fish stand - the staff behind the counter will clean and split the fish, and even roast it for you if you like.
A very large part of the store has been placed under an impressive freezer, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and gallangal, ducks, whole fish, beef blood and bile, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-fabricates and so forth.
Who buys there: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individual buyers.
There are shopping carts and forklifts in the wide passageway.
Found: Fresh Durian Montong near the exit.
The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of the Chinese quarter and the business centre of the city, several blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy.
The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Narushkin, admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the Middle East so that waves of refugees can flow into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar at the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I'm not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question is, isn't Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized North Africa and the Middle East in recent years with such cassava?," he asked.
"It must have been someone who thought and knew that the flow of refugees, these unfortunate and impoverished people who are fleeing death, would rush into the prosperous EU countries," he added.
Narushkin asked: "Did many political leaders in Europe speak frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally piercing their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Narushkin, NATO is flouting many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long looked and watched in an impartial manner at how NATO-made military boots melt down moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," stressed the Speaker.
Government troops and loyal militias are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group Islamic State, which is banned from Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The U.S. supports the rebels, who oppose both Assad and IG.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria described the cause of the West's dislike of Russia.
Western claims against countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel I, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian Gazette.
According to Assad, the West does not see partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and place another person in his place, who would act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sudden turn of Western media with the beginning of a coup in Ukraine.
For them, he said, Russia's President Vladimir Putin "became from a friend of the West to an enemy, a king, a dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, even though he was elected by democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West ' s constant claims that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he left, at the request of the people, rather than by a decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, or else they should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was under way with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iranian military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"It is natural that there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place," he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperating with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Igil coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group Islamic State, banned in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition strikes IG positions from the air.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to a representative of the State Department, John Kirby.
It is noted that the subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
In doing so, he stated that the US had tools for "the further isolation of Russia" if it supported Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, passed on to RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, in his conversation with Kerry, once again stressed the need to establish a unified front against terrorist groups operating in that country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
Some bilateral issues were also raised.
American officials had previously stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and had expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
In Washington, they said that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be further isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President Dmitri Peskov's press secretary stated that the country would not be placed in international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist organization Islamic State.
The U.S.-led international coalition is targeting IG positions with air strikes.
The beard called the American newspaper's information a slander on Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He told Lenta.ru in a telephone interview.
The note at Washington Post is beautiful that it's completely twisted.
The former DPR Minister of Defence, Igor Strelkov, of course, did not bind and "leave" from the territory of the Republics of Donbass in a very elevated mood, without ropes, without three furs of money attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Borodai, it was really about Arrow talking to an American newspaper reporter.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the DPR government.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why an American reporter decided to write that Strelkov had been taken to Russia "connected."
I suspect it's provocation.
If this isn't provocation, it's amazingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that the Arrows were leaving themselves," said Borody.
"It's slander against me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Previously on The Washington Post, an article appeared that quoted Borodai saying that he had forcibly taken Strelkov to Russia.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to tie up his companion.
The Polish authorities have begun searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish loggers have begun cutting trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, and is reported by Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the credibility of rumours about the railway composition with treasure.
There may be weapons and precious minerals inside the trains.
On 31 August, the governor of the Polish Nizhnesilez voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, assumed that new evidence of the existence of a gold train was no more convincing than previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's Vice-Minister of Culture, Peter Zhuhowski, stated that local treasure detectors had "99 per cent probability" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in legends.
Zhuhovski pointed out that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels were discovered, they would be the property of the State Treasury, and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhih with a report that they had found a train in a sealed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Russian Federation ' s main drug dealer has proposed banning the sale of tobacco to persons up to the age of 21.
Russia's main drug dealer suggested banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Yevgeny Bruhn noted that until then, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful."
That is what he said on the live air of Radio "Sovorit Moscow," commenting on the information that the Speaker of Sovfed Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A man is growing unequally.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a man who is physically ready to do so.
Mentally, he's been ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It's known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only finally developing by 21 years," says Brune.
Earlier, Sultan Hamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and project leader of "Sober Russia," informed Izvestyam that Matvienko had supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and had "agreed, together with the Public Chamber, to raise the issue again on the platform of the upper house of Parliament."
According to an activist, a working group would soon be established in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Child Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible's compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development," a statement was made on 16 September by Sib.phm.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he purchased a Bible from the Chinese City store on Red Prospect, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments which, in his view, violated the FOC "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development."
On 16 September, the application was taken up by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
The appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be answered within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, as the complainant commented to Sib.phm.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that's gonna kick society apart.
It will begin to read the Bible, which it has not done before.
The Brazilian Paediatric Union Ryu Grandi promotes healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method by which to convince women of the need to feed fully during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of babies who suck breasts and are painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy needs, pregnant women and mothers are encouraged to increase daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that increasing calories alone is not the only diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents their tumors from developing.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been detected.
There was a school bus under Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision.
It's on video from one of the high school students.
There was a panic among the students because of the emergency.
Some children began to cry and run along the shoulder.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was hit by a miracle, except for one passenger of a train who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local sportsman David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with Philippinian Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali with a knockout in the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life support system.
In a professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, only two defeats, and one battle ended in a fight.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died of injuries in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not engaging in this type of sport, but rather prohibiting it altogether.
I understand that this is not happening intentionally,' said Vice President Stephen Parnis of the organization.
But as boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete gets hemorrhaging or brain injury, leading to either death or severe damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narushkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergei Narushkin, described the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians as unacceptable.
He stated this at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as an unacceptable act, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
In addition, Narushkin called on OSCE PA participants to re-establish the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back to politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"Double never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, a solution to the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," said Narishkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common platform where we are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," stressed the politician.
Let us recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed winning a couple of days or three.
World Champion of the Light Athletics, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be described as triumphant for a 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei SUBENKOVA.
He managed to win Europe's first team, set several records, and, above all, become the world's champion, the first in the history of a domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, he recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, ranking third in the overall score.
The New Istology asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergei, the season isn't over yet?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the World Wars Games, which are gonna be in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna think about rest.
It's true, I'm gonna be at home right now in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different condition.
It's easier than walking around the world every week.
You once said autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a beautiful time.
The passions after the main start of the season are boiling, the burden of liability is no longer pressing.
You can compete for pleasure, on the loose.
Plus, you know that vacation's coming up...
Are you tired?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
End-of-season fatigue always accumulates.
And it doesn't matter what you do, whether you win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, moves, all of this doesn't go to the body without trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I'm getting emotional, of course.
I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the Beijing World Cup, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists won't let me forget about it.
But in fact, I think it's bad that an athlete who lives in old wins spins his successful race over and over again.
Enjoyed the victory of a couple or three days, and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started preparing as early as December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Trained first at Barnaul's house, then at the rally, then back at home.
It's the usual.
But with the coach, the challenge was to try to get to a new level I wasn't at yet.
Almost all winter time was spent setting up a base.
We ran a bunch of sneakers, did general physical training exercises, which included both the thrust and the seat and the back.
Then we got into barrier training, we did a lot of engineering.
Were they watching the rivals?
I always try to do that, the good of the Internet age with it is no problem.
I saw Europe's Winter Championship, and the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier sprint!
Thought I'd do something, dip this company.
With every start this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had the same pattern for all the last seasons.
There's no way I run at 13.20 and then at 13.50.
I always turn my uniform gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All work focused on this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to do things, and it's not always possible to show your readiness at competitions.
What was it like at the Olympics in London?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race.
Ready to be very good, could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I were to repeat my best result at the time, I'd be a bronze prize for the Games.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, there was this maximum program.
And he fell right off the morning, in the pre-runs.
That's when I realized that tearing up and smashing my head means not running anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Championships, the finals were finished with better time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I wanted to win the gold already!
How do you keep your head up, keep your head up, keep your head down?
And that's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't break the barriers.
Noticed that it's much easier when you focus on the process than on the result.
And it's fun when you feel like you're running and it's like you're doing it all by yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the interior, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever thought of that?
It's better at home anyway.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better terms, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
How long have you guys been together?
Since I was 12 years old, I've been in a light athlete.
Well, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped three times in length.
A kid's fight was when the ball was bleached, jumped in the length of the seat...
I tried running with the barriers when I was 14, and I liked it.
Since the first race, the second adult grade has been met.
I stayed.
Have you ever had a fear of the barriers?
One day I got a deal with them.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There's been a lot of trouble over this one.
But there's no way out of this routine.
The techs have to pull out all the time - so I can wake up at night, I'll get up right away and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my runs, but I couldn't help it.
But efficiency needs to be further developed - there is no limit to perfection.
Don't you think winning the Olympics a year before will be a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
If you choose this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are pissed, I know they don't feed - give it to the enemy.
And even though I didn't roll the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, a million times I've said here, and I didn't directly call anyone a bastard, - I got hit by another.
All my pseudo-friends have evaporated in a second.
The press I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, who's seen the kind of guys, think people are full of food.
It's like he was walking around, and you were attacked by a crowd and you're gonna muzzle.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, old me, guys, scared.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, and now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency in me, so take a bite.
And only assholes can give passports to assholes like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili briefly described Crimean events:
What you did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I'm guessing that the reference to the way that Chrushchev's booster tried to sign something doesn't fit into the general picture of the human dorm.
It's like coming to a neighbor's house and taking his living space...
The Kremlin war is over, and it's only gonna end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some cremble-chamber bastard.
I have an idea who it might have been...
Cobson doesn't have much to live on.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they destroyed his monument.
Of course, people have remembered him as insulting to their small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads the ratings despite the Nine's attempts to highlight the leadership loss at Today Show
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's visit to Canberra to report on the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement of the release of the leader's seat failed to raise the ratings for Today significantly.
The ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The competition, Sunrise, with leading David Coch and Samantha Armitage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts, which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture did not seem to matter much to Australian viewers, although Sunrise had 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities, compared to 339,000 today.
Today scored slightly more than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August Today had 318,000, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349 000 viewers versus 314 000 in Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are more powerful than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the clarification!
Published on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The important news for Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star Packed to the Rafters by Eric Thomson.
The new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without the star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a loud yes answer.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For Seven, the luck and failure of the second night of Chase Australia were mixed.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV quiz that Andrew O'Kife was running gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5.30 p.m. to 6.00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 viewers, and the second half hour was the overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat has a total of 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia's second night ratings will make the Ninth quiet admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30 p.m.
Chase Australia is the replacement of Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuire show.

The three finalists are unanimous that Sam Wood's Bachelor is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snowman Markoski may have accidentally made it clear which one of them would win at the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood eventually stays at the Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And three of the girls who reached the finals are, of course, silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when I met Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcoski, and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls are supposed to be left, they may have accidentally given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until Thursday's finale.
All three women are in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, his sense of purpose, his family values, his vitality as the reason why each one of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should the last rose of Wood be?," they might have hesitated to tell which of them had actually won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski have no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I became a member, I felt Sam's energy and energy and realized that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Jevons-Fellos.
"Sara's a very open man, she's easy and funny," Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there's really a attraction between them.
They feel fine and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
McKay herself said that she realized from her home visits last week that Wood might be the "whose man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized it wasn't just a game, I believed him with all my heart," she says.
To the question of who would Wood be to choose if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hayn had several options for starting his career at the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States - as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball that a former Australian rugby league player allowed at the first return of the punt in a 20-3 win-win game with Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to get the punt back, and he also used it in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of smashing the rookie in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
Special reporter 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarreed Hayne lost the ball on the return of the punt by the Minnesota Weikings team during the first quarter.
This is the beginning of the debut at NHL Hain and his numerous Australian fans were clearly not counting on it.
It was seen that Hayne was arguing when he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the show host Hamish and Andy on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not have imagined a better start for a career in the NFL.
"That's what happens, you're just thinking about the next game, that's all," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his misses to his debut in the 2007 Origin series, when a ball throw in his credit zone gave Queensland an attempt.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at Siberian airport.
The openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were stopped.
Migrants clashed with the police on Hungary ' s border.
The refugees staged protests on Serbia's border near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which turned into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, Hungarian police used water canisters and tear gas, transferring Reuters.
Migrants threw stones at police officers and were attempting to dismantle the fence at the border.
Support is being directed to the scene of the clashes, and the police are responding to the aggression of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serb-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reporting to BBC.
The country ' s authorities had allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the country in question.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provided for the participation of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who crossed the border illegally, and the accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court had already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider the transfer of border security functions to the Hungarian armed forces in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
Russians have confessed to committing the largest cyber attack in US history.
The accused of the largest cyber attack in United States history, Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the trial before the federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke about a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks against 15 companies.
The cumulative damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," stated US Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a $1 million fine.
In sentencing, the court will take Russian confessions into account and may reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be pronounced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smiljane, was taken into custody.
His last conviction for the crimes he is charged with denies.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia's support of the Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, United States Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad exacerbated the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Al-Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," says a report published on the United States State Department's website.
Kerry confirmed the US's commitment to fighting the Islamic State (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "will never be able to be a reliable member of the coalition."
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of support for the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if she did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian territory.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians learn technology to use it against Islamists.
Four people died when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, as the official spokesman stated on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishno Prasad Daqal, the head of the district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Daqal reported that the police had used tear gas, then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last violent protest in weeks in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where Madesi people claim that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the Taru citizens who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes since 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces, a decisive step towards a new constitution, a highly contentious issue in Nepal that has been centrally administered for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake, which claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to set up an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry and has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
One year ago, Sayansk was led by the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the "Regional" correspondent.
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start as mayor?
First of all, I read the results of the financial and economic audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditures.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce documentation to five days.
Previously, court papers could have been going on for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the revenue base and to optimize costs.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no design document (SAP) for any site in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of POJA for roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Roadworks are already under way on two sections.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of day care is one of the most pressing issues today.
With effect from 1 September, he closed for 320 places for the major renovation of kindergarten No. 10.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
In the past year, after the renovation, the day care centre No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was made with co-financing from the regional and local budgets, at a cost of over 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds have been secured for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priority of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have lines for kids between the ages of three and seven.
Do investors have an interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be carried out, first and foremost, by the Sayan enterprises, which must be provided with work.
As early as October, a 60-family orphanage in the Leningrad district was being operated.
In terms of construction, Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria that has entered the economy-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing that would like to participate in the programme.
One condition is that the dwelling should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a turnkey trim.
If we can handle the set amounts, we can continue to participate in the program.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
==History==Sayan Swinkoplex was built in the Territory and sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the D.A.'s office to protest this deal.
Especially since the land under the target is federally owned.
Work is under way with Moscow and the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares to regional ownership is being resolved, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
We're gonna get 900 jobs with the piggyback, which will be a big help to the city.
Is the Social Partnership Institute developed in Sayansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Businesses such as East-Centre, New-Ziminskaya TEC, Sayansk Broiler, PK IDF, receive tangible support, and the management of these enterprises respond to all requests.
Immediately on the Day of the City of Sayan Broiler gave the city a children's town, and East Centre carried out repairs to the cavalry, where professionals deal with children in the area of therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship, the city's civil service has been established.
The sponsors helped celebrate City Day in a beautiful way.
As in the good old days, the parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
A record of the city, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The pioneers and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sayansk have been given commemorative medals.
They also participate in the city ' s charitable foundation.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 rubles have been earmarked to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from low-income families.
How are the human resources problems in the social sphere resolved in Sayansk?
There aren't enough doctors and teaching staff in the city.
The provision of shelter for professionals is crucial to resolving the staffing issue.
Over the past year, we have provided five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been provided with office accommodation.
We have a housing programme with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plan is to re-engineer a building with eight more teachers' apartments.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Housing for the Russian Family" programme.
In the long run, construction of a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sayansk and our region have great potential.
A bill has been submitted to the Duma on the indexation of social pensions in the light of rising prices.
A bill has been submitted to the State to provide for the indexation of social pensions every year, starting on 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, Mr. Alexander Lomakin-Rumentsev, a deputy of "A Fair Russia," also proposes that the pensions be further indexed on 1 April if the rate of increase in the subsistence level exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
In accordance with the legislation in force, social pensions are indexed annually on 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth in the minimum subsistence level of the pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law submitted to the Lower House provides for the introduction of an indexation of social pensions to take account of the rate of consumer price growth.
The first indexation is carried over to 1 February and the second one is carried out on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated to Mogerini that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federique Mogerini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva stated that sanctions should not be imposed on legislators participating in assembly events.
This was reported to the journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, have collected signatures in support of Canerva ' s position.
"A strong enough support has already developed," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had expressed his intention to collect signatures from deputies who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing structures and "send a petition."
NHC reports that the probability of cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60 per cent
The wide front of the low-pressure area, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands, has the probability of 60 per cent turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
Another well-defined area of low pressure around the middle of the Green Cape and the Small Antilles islands also has a 60 per cent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, reported by synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help refugee refugees who have fled from war-torn and impoverished countries who have flooded Europe.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach to announce a collection campaign on her blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google Officer Rita Masoud, who ran away with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on questionable trains and buses, we were starving, thirsty, cold and afraid," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Donations will be given to four non-profit organizations working to assist refugees and migrants: Médecins sans frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on the Google.com/refugeerrelief page reached $11 million.
Europe has been facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with mild obesity can be helped by obesity surgery
The beneficial effect of obesity surgery on people with small obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to claim that diabetics with mild obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving nonsurgery treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not immediately apparent," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor's column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of the organization to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morphide obesity with body mass index (IMT) 35 or higher.
The MRI, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at a value between 18.5 and 24.9.
The IMT 25 or above indicates that humans are overweight, and people with IMTs above 30 are considered to be obese people.
You can calculate your MRI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypassing and gestrectomy - with the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with small obesity.
The average value of the MRI for those who were subjected to surgical intervention fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, MRIs for those who received non-surgery treatment for diabetes remain at about 29.
Among those who underwent the surgery, 36 per cent were fully cured of diabetes and 28 per cent were partially cured.
In a group that received medication, by comparison, only 1% had full diabetes treatment and only about 2% had partial diabetes treatment.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" cholesterol LPN " were generally better in the surgical team," the authors argue.
Researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflected blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better held below 7%, says researchers.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c fell from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8 per cent.
But the best glycemic controls, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Chang Soo's research manager and colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared with the gestrate group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in the BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and the A1c hemoglobin (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent), and was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment actually increases life expectancy, as reported by Blackstone at the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study of obese people who chose bariatic intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower than that of a group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with a BMI below 35 who were interested in such a procedure.
"This report is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in a group with a low MRI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or renal disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient's MRI reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they build genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse.
In the Mouses, the robbers removed 9 million rubles from the house of the coats.
In the Mouses, the robbers attacked the inhabitants of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women ' s coats.
Interfax refers to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house on Gorkogo Street through an open front door, bound the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, abducted 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, and criminal proceedings were instituted under the heading "Rabbling."
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will attend the World Cup in 2018.
The remaining hotels are in no hurry to obtain a permit.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world championship, the authorities will have to come up with an urgent way of resettling all the city's guests.
The Rosbalt interviewees believe that the tournament will increase the rent of rental flats by 10-30%, and will have to be overpaid after the championship for rental housing.
The World Football Championship has led the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically for the first time, every hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do so: hotel operators are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS Head Vadim Vladimirov, the department has examined 138 hotels and now plans to file 34 hotel cases, many of which simply did not respond to the competition.
There are indications that the leaders of three dozen companies have deceived the citizens by posting a number of stars in advertising, and have noted the Vladimirs.
The problem is, right now, there's literally every number, and no one can be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the football championship, the fans will take all the Petersburg hotels.
Today, tourists in the city can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two-star and three-star hotels and 550 single-star hotels.
According to Nana Gwichia, the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, only 23 hotels have so far been classified, with so many inspections carried out by companies accredited to Petersburg.
However, it is not known whether a hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises.
I mean, there may be more classified, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of the hotel weren't very eager to be classified," admitted the director of the North-West Branch of the Russian Union of the Tour Industry, Ekaterin Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season in which hotels earn the most and do not want to do other things.
Another reason was the budgets, which did not include the cost of testing, and the procedure could be applied to the hotel, depending on the status of 30,000 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, hotel managers have recently stepped up and started applying for classification, assuring Shadskaya.
Hotels have to make it before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but they will not be allowed to work for the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed during the tournament.
The cost formulas will be released next year.
This is intended to prevent price escalation by 200-300 per cent, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum, for example.
You have to have a conscience and not be promoted twice or three times, but hotels need to be given money.
"I think it's gonna be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association, Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixation is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this fits into economic theory, but I hope it's justified.
"It's better than an unbridled price," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Members of the State Duma had introduced a bill to prohibit hostels in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be passed or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will argue that the hostels should be preserved," Nana Guachia says.
However, she said that mini-hotel owners should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma did approve the bill, some 80 per cent of the hostels would be closed down in Petersburg, and there were currently 1,500 numbers.
According to President Leonid Garbar of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of the North-West, there are two and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg that are just needed by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation where 75,000 vips sit on the 80 thousand stadium.
It can be fixed at the expense of a mini-hotel.
Their possible prohibition is considered by the expert to be "idiotic": "I think it's weird that some people can live in apartments, but some visitors can't."
If the hostel is used as a dorm, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests come for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hospitals risk skipping the World Cup and being slow.
Hundreds of small hotels just don't have time to be classified, and they dig a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will have ordered work.
"The companies that may not do this much, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive," noted Gennadius Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of checks that have been completed are now much higher than those of Petersburg.
The reason for the Petersburg delay is related, inter alia, to the permanent relocation of the Government ' s tourist block, which is not conducive to smooth work.
According to experts, if there is not enough Petersburg hotels, it is likely to be necessary to look at regional hotels and vacation homes.
Following the example of the celebration of St. Petersburg's 300th anniversary in the city, the river fleet can be mobilized, which means that guests of the tournament can live in cabins.
In addition, a lot of fans will come by the vans to sleep in.
"The Chief doesn't set up so many hotels that they'll be empty," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
Removable housing will also be very popular during the football competition.
It is likely that the city will create a reserve of rental apartments.
The rent rate will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious, the first to leave the house near the stadium," noted the renter of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Larissa Bragin.
The rent may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city would also contribute to this, she stressed.
And let us not forget the human qualities of the people of the city.
For example, Leonid Garbar believes that Petersburg has always been a welcoming city in which people not only guide the road, but can also conduct a mini tour.
There are also complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970, father, mother, and two children.
They had no place to sleep: hotels were difficult at the time, and it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to bed," the interviewer remembered.
True, he added that now there was no such feature in the city's inhabitants - calling for their homes is fraught with consequences and scary.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of the hotel and the government, may have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "slit" Amur region.
I admired the Girinovsky clown in the State Duma today.
He did these things when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in perfect shape.
The theme of the speech is "LDPR's protest against the results of the Amur elections."
The protocols are not shaking - because there is nothing to do; there are apparently no protocols other than those signed by the zebras.
He's raising the second-ranking Ivan Abramov and he's yelling, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then, after an altercation with the presiding officer, he takes the faction out of the conference room, screaming, "You're all with your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but rather on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfovich had a beautiful and elegant leak of the Amur region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky-style "Dawnock" act, not a political protest against the results of a particular election.
And the faction was formally mortified, and the election, according to the party's website and Facebook, Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the subject.
Allows the dead in Amur to bury their dead themselves, and he himself gives good news against "One Russia" in general and innocent Rodnina in general.
It's an elegant decision not to lose a face, and not a real scandal.
The other thing is that the Abrams themselves are now in a strange situation.
He waited for nothing other than a shout from his superiors, there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for the narrow circle, he has become a formal occasion for insulting the esteemed championship, and, more than ever, for ham attacks against EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main electoral beneficiary, region 2 policy and candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, it could turn into a parietal that was successfully used by the party's own leadership and super-irritator for the party's own FNP and party leadership.
Of course, it wouldn't have been Zhirinovsky, but it should have been invented and watched with respect.
The Trump is still growing and growing before it.
There's news that LDPR will return to the gym during the next plenary.
I mean, the bath fell with nothing at all.
The only thing that happened was that Abramov was buried under her.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accept all refugees, stated the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee-born countries.
The Dalai Lama referred to the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center of Compassion in Oxford on ethics research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He stated that, under the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be superior to those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while that was a cause for admiration, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you must also think of durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US's harsh reaction had triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a non-violence solution was possible.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children swallowing hand disinfectant over the past 4 years
Toxicology centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a high alcohol disinfectant, as reported by the tox centre in Georgia, since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord López, director of the tox centre in Georgia, the cases of children under the age of 12 ingesting hand disinfectants reported to toxic treatment centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percentage goes to the emergency room," said López CNN.
He explained that some children drink disinfectant fluids on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or social media disputes.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluids as cheap booze.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluids.
"The child doesn't think it can hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (manipulative fluids) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfectant fluids for the hands with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant hand fluid contains about 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
For young children in particular, only a few spraying can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's high concentration alcohol," told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, the chief doctor of the toxicology centre at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't leave a whiskey shot just like that, but people keep these hand disinfectants visible, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, with about four sprays, was sent to the ER for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Centre near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and could not walk when she was taken to the E.R.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid any signs of brain injury, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," told CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-ventilated substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for their hands from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-grade students in northern New York conspired to poison their "opportunity" teacher by "dissemination of anti-bacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher's allergic to hand disinfectants, and she forbade keeping them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk," and address discipline issues to the school district.
Like the oldest children's library in Barnaul, she became a family club.
There's a iron owl on the back of the bench at the entrance to N.K.'s regional children's library.
The little ones who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
It's been going to this library for 95 years.
The earliest readers in the 20th century were performing loud readings, performing plays on Mayakovsky's poems, doing literary quiz, and texting Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the Young Stalinite newspaper wrote in 1939, the "friendship between Nadzhda Konstantin Krupskaya and friends of Barnaul's children's library" became stronger every day.
Hope Konstantinovna even sent a picture of her childhood to distant Barnaul friends once.
And when the Barnaulians asked if Nadej Konstantinovna wouldn't mind getting her name assigned to the library, she wrote that she didn't mind.
Letters have been burning in the museum for a long time, and the grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile the barel is decorating on the library building.
During the years of adjustment, many people called and complained: Why is the children's library not renamed?
Let's have a library with the name of some good child writer, no political colour!
Library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as the "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick path.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme for an artist named Olie Moskovki.
Ola used to be the manager of a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and only love of painting was different from all the other managers.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "I want an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Ola made illustrations, and she thought life could end at any moment, and there would be no wonder in it if you didn't create them yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates children's books for writers all over the world, and makes stories herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, " says Russian Planet, director of Tatiana Cushvid Library.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's gonna live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is returning.
In the library lobby, there's a large exhibition window with an up-to-date photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new pictures of readers who go to the library by their whole family - Mom, Dad, and children - are posted.
The library rejoices that dads are increasingly coming with their children.
When the child was two years old, he needed more complicated books.
But now there's a law that prohibits an eight-year-old Wonderkind from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a child has to bring his parents with him - they come back, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - the pre-revolutionary collection was made with yats and chers, to lead the Korolenko in an annex to "Niva" magazine, a 1936 Murzilki sticker.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "chram of the book," we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, - explains Tatiana Cushvid.
We can come to read, play, paint together.
We've made a playground for the little ones-- the kid just comes to play, and the hand's still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they stick their feet around, and they don't want to leave.
Mums with strollers often come - and we are pleased to see that the library is ranked first among all the other places to come with the babies.
Tatiana Cushvid says, "Today's children are just as we used to love classical children's literature:
"The publishing business is being developed and much attention is being paid to authors who are a link between generations."
And when it comes to little kids, it's important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents, which describe what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth looking at, and why.
The bouquets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
Adults are not allowed to take books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
In the farthest room of the library, there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookhouse.
The steps will squeak under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old comrade: hey, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie's still walking on the yellow brick road, lazy Tol's Reds are stealing magic matches, and the Kibalchis still haven't told the goddamn war secret bourgeoiss - that's his firm word.
Books like passwords, you can find yours anywhere.
There are true book rareties in the vault - for example, the prerevolutionary collection was made with owls and kers.
Or take Korolenko to the famous Niva magazine app.
Or the 1936 Murzilka stick.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming of retirement and dealing with rare children's books.
But the kids aren't gonna do it anymore, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes are... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was interesting, " says "Russian Planet," Galina Ilasov, who runs the book store.
The Murzilki pages are dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs a book store all her life.
She knows the color of the hood at Buratino, in which school year Harry Potter became captain of the Griffindor team at the Quiddich Championship, in which situations Carlson uses the motor silencer, and by whom Alice Selezeva's father works.
The work of the librarian is underpaid, and anyone who can live without these book rows finds another profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced ones remain: educators, educators, ministers of the book.
You can also know them by smiling - it's thought to be a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like children's books in general: as a librarian, I like them to be on the shelves, and I love to read them, " says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical, fairy tales, fantastic.
I'm reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think things were different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them incredibly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the drivers.
And I'm glad our former readers bring children, or grandchildren...
Rumour mill: There's no disagreement in Celtic.
Griffiths denied talking about a disagreement at Celtic after Dale's admission that Hoops is in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Harts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might disrupt the team's unity.
"Dons" increased the edge over "Celtic" to five points.
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a little advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, allowing Dons to lose Celtic for five points.
Griffiths denied talking about differences.
This gave rise to rumours of controversy in Celtic, which was interrupted by Griffiths, who claimed that he and his teammates were not suffering from any increased criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because there are no Scottishs fighting for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch team member Ronald de Bur claimed that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic because he did not compete for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now the representative of Ayaksa, said, "The Holland is no longer showing the most attractive moments of Celtic games, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about getting the Rangers back.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Company games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
Malmeu's defeat and, as a result, the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen football players, who are now in the top line of the table with five points.
But Dale said, "The Celitka has had bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very unfortunate, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic's support, because it makes the players much better.
It's important to stay together now.
Warburton is looking forward to the January transfers with mistrust.
Despite opinions just a few weeks ago suggesting that he has identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, the Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is suspicious of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the team's unity.
Brentford's former assailant stated: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt, which is what you saw in our own group this season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu, who's interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career.
Swansea's attacker Michau, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans was over.
A 29-year-old player suffered from an ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Charters are going to stand up to the SFA about Neilson's statements.
The "Harts" were running at 2:1 when Paterson was removed, and started to lose 3:2, but the red defense card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not decline to say, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tyncasl.
The stubborn player of the Hybernan team got reprimanded after he admitted to singing a song with offensive words about former player "Harts" Rudy Skatzel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, prior to the beginning of the Edinburgh derby in Tyncasle in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was hot," the assailant said, adding, "I can say with certainty that I wasn't going back to Tincastle if he wasn't playing Celtic.
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the management of Dundy United.
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundy United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deteriorating situation on the field must end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the guys to come out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad that "unbeautiful" won from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdin team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the seventh consecutive win of the league, which put them five points above Celica, up the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time penalty.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win anything-- a cup, or a league championship who didn't win meetings like this."
The unemployment rate among Scots remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was 5.5% higher for the United Kingdom, as the National Statistics Service (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with a current total of 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in a quarter, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mandela, commented on the most recent figures: "The Government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made its historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I witness to the Oklahoma execution?
Today, by avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting on a death row watch gallery in Oklahoma State prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
That request was first made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story about the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and because they often want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
Prison administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of being impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "may have better wording" herself, but she still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not gonna go into the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry van Treze's murder make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's not guilty of murder.
I strongly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man I like die without need.
A man wanted by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
Constable from Canning Valley managed to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry.
Perth's resident intended to leave the police but failed to get stuck in dirty water in a shallow water a few metres from a police officer trying to "simplely persuade him to go ashore."
Canning-Vail police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into someone else's territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them by leaving for Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, come on, grab me," said Sergeant Sergeant Shandell Castledein.
Constable Laclan Perhavetz didn't really want to wash his uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiating with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Castledein.
That's what Ben Cazins remembers when he's a football champ.
In 2006, Cazins moved into a ditch to avoid meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but he encouraged the locals to invent a funny "beatlon of Ben Kazins."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of trying to spy and threatens to leave horse sports.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria's flight attendant of trying to inject a spy into his stable last year and threatened to leave horse sports immediately.
He was targeted by flight attendants and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, who he accused of campaigning against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from her start due to drug abuse on Wednesday was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always doing his best in the race, and he was in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lidari test on the cobalt, which he couldn't explain.
He kept his mouth shut about the suspicion of spying for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't gonna say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's so out of your league that you can't stop," Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think they're not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody previously sensationally stated during an interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'd call if asked, and offered him a job at my stable to convey information about what I was doing in my stable," Moody said on Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If so, they should certainly all file a complaint, as the attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Rolston, former president of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, external executive director of RVL, knew all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold people accountable for what's going on in this business, other than the coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now might make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I will put pressure and responsibility on them to make a decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Coach's anger was only growing during a long investigation into the Cobalt and Lidari case, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him say he could throw his license on the table.
Moody, best known for having prepared the invincible champion Black Caviar, described the requirements for the use of drugs on the day of the competition as "laughter-making" after a clay compress was placed on the horse's feet, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules at the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly gave her a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could've gotten it yesterday, like she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
The Moody may be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the compress competition, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
The driver, who had been raided and had fled the Kobram incident, was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car in Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram resident, remains in a stable condition in the hospital.
Melburn Storm Coach Craig Bellamy's colliding with rivals in the use of severe force.
The Melburn Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, called the criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as "the imposition of the agenda" by the two favorites of the NRL Championship.
Sidney Rusters Coach Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm to "fight" his team during the sudden victory of Storm in Sydney's final qualification game on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the finals of a qualifying tournament from the Northern Queensland Cabouchess on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and said that two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and claimed that they were simply concentrated on "Contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team by the two leading coaches, which meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat of Storm.
"It keeps popping up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about tough tricks when they beat us at 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our defense systems or techniques, but in the last six weeks, we've been paying special attention to contact when we intercept the ball, and that's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always shows up this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about "impressive football," reminding his teacher that St. George's Illawarra Dragons won Bennett's 2010 championship by showing boring football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.
I remember that in 2010, St. George had a lot of criticism calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care about it at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is an impressive football game, especially his young paramedics at their speed.
It's a football game you'd want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two half-defendants like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the game "Storma" and "Roosters" was a competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Cauboise."
Broncos was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, he was 8:18, there were two more attempts -- and what, this is impressive football?
Or do you think it's an impressive break and a failed attempt?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means we can meet them there at some point.
At Storm's at the end of this week's weekend, since they won the right to host either North Queensland Cabus or Cronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the AAMI Park final, the tickets will be available for sale next Tuesday morning.
The accused of possession of drugs is released on bail at $200,000.
A man facing life imprisonment for attempting to sequester 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail at $200,000.
Marco Maksimovich, 29, was one of five people arrested last month after federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which passed from South America via Vanuatu and moored in Kumer in August.
During the whole morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the wharf, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite Maksimović ' s risk of life imprisonment for attempting to procure sufficient quantities of narcotic drugs for sale, Maksimović ' s lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter attempted to obtain the entire shipment and that the man could have been in the cafe without intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich's mother and stepfather were offered a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
"From the testimony of both, it is clear that the bail of $200,000 is too heavy a financial burden for them," noted Judge Flanagan.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, added the judge.
Maksimović was allowed to be released on bail on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police every day and observes the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the Greek team that fought until the last few seconds."
He paid tribute to his team after the 1/4 Eurobasket 2015 final match with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game has solved some mistakes.
It was a big game, quote AFP Katsikaris.
We were preparing for a great game of Spanish performance.
We tried to work our defenses, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSCA, I will be entrusted with the functions of Kauna."
Newcomer Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the army's curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quote "R-Sport" Freeland. "In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kauna, who left the team, both in the defense structures and in the attack from a three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to rebuild to the center position, but I was more of a forward in the NBA.
Now I'm gonna have to confront the big center rival more, but I've done it before, so I think I'm gonna do it now.
The army won the Euroleague last in 2008.
Since then, they've gotten to Final Four six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling someone jinxed the team.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand the club's disappointment and his fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moskwiches have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the jinx, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination if you put these two things together, everything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Luis Enrique: "To me, the match with "Roma" will be special."
Barcelona's chief coach, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st tournament of the Championship League with Rome with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his present and former team will not be a private match.
We will recall that Luis Enrique trained wolfs in the 2011-12 season, but failed to prove himself on the best side in Italy's capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I had some experience, and I quoted the official UEFA website Luis Enrique's words.
I have a very warm memory of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it doesn't matter.
The main thing is to start in the League of Champions from victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm looking forward to the "Roma" game she showed in the "A" series against "Juventus."
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scripchenko: The Krasnodar has various options for attacking.
The Acting Chief Coach of Urala, Vadim Scripchenko, in advance of the 9th tour of the premiere league with Rednodar, noted the diversity of the rival team's attacking schemes.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of assault in their arsenal.
The fight will take place on 21 September and start at 4.30 Moscow time.
When we play with the Red Water, we'll see about it, which is the official Urala website that Scrypchenko says.
We've got a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has a variety of attack options, a variety of attacks, while we're not slow, so I think it's gonna be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting a League of Europe match against Dortmund's Borussia, let's try very well to prepare ourselves to win.
Roher Kanyas: "The house of "Astana" can take the glasses away from anyone."
Rocher Kanyas, a half-defendant of the "Astana" after the first round of the group tournament of the League of Champions with "Benfiqa" (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Hawbek, in their field, the Astanans are able to take their glasses away from any rival.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can say that we played well, says UEFA's official website, Kanyas.
Benfiq's upstairs, but in a home match, I think we can count on taking away their glasses.
It's quite real.
But first we have to think about Galatasarai and then Atletico.
At home matches, we can take the glasses away from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll tell you all about it: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
The main coach of the Reala, Rafael Benitez, expressed his satisfaction with the major victory in the first tournament of the Championship League's Championship Championship Championship (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to Forward Cristian Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
The match was difficult because Schachter knows how to own the ball, says the official UEFA website Benitez.
The opponent hasn't had many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I'm not saying Real was perfect, but we had plenty of golf opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the balls and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll do it all the time.
Jordani Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo cannot compare to Messie."
The Barcelonian's protector, Jordani Alba, thinks that no one can compare with his clubmate, Lionel Messey.
According to the Spaniard, Cristiano Ronaldo's forward "Reala" can't do that either.
Messi is five heads higher than the others, quote Le Figaro Alba.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things are changing, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a bright personality.
"Roma" half-defendant Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the team tournament of the Barcelona League noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game against such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 9.45 p.m. Moscow time.
Let's remind her that "S.E." is going to broadcast her text.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, quote UEFA De Rossi's official website.
It's hard to play with blue-granates because they have not only unique styles but also bright identities.
To keep them, we're gonna have to plow through the entire game and keep each other safe.
The Messiah is almost always successful when he goes into the fold, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.
Jezhov hopes to be part of the SKA's start-up team in a match with Slovan.
Golkiper SKA Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hoped to join the army in the next game of the CFC Championship.
Jezhov went out to ice instead of Mikko Koskinen for the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the throws at his gate, SKA's fourth goal was missed after replacing the goalkeeper with a sixth field player.
The next match will be held by the team on their way out against Slovan.
I hope I'll go out in the next match at the start-up team, and I'll bring "R-Sport" to Jezhov's words.
I'm not a goalie expert, I'm a goalkeeper, we don't have a repeat of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone has a bad match.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Lucy Shafarzhova is hospitalized with bacterial infection, reports AFP.
So far, a Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
The timeline for the recovery of Roland Garros-2015 is not yet known.
It will also be recalled that on Monday Shafarzhova rose to one line in the WTA rating and is now the fifth world racket.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get paedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, registered with the Internet service for messages, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, and immediately brought it to her mother's attention.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at the address and found "relevant" requests in the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the cops he did it because it could be "involving paedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a cop to scare them."
Judicial Commissioner Eiled Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was making inquiries on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare paedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and asked for more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a headache when he was drinking and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone, and then the defendant had a confrontational bet.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of producing indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail terms on 25 January of this year and not appearing before a court on 24 March of this year.
The defendant ' s counsel, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be included in the list of perpetrators of sexual offences because it could be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, pending receipt of social services certificates.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was taken into custody before the hearing of the other remaining cases.
It was added to the list of perpetrators of sexual offences prior to the date of sentencing.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, is reading the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, Africa ' s oldest statesman, fell down the runway earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the drop scene spread overnight through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to warn them against the whistle-blowering of Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they suspended the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that speech was repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe ' s speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but is entitled "Death," he told the journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the members of Parliament that immunity ends in the Parliament building, and as soon as they leave, parliamentary inviolability does not work.
A Member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard proposes to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme of restructuring and reducing the cost of service delivery.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service operations sectors.
The estimated reduction in jobs will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, as stated in Hewlett-Packard's statement.
"Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will head the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard now, and the portfolio of business will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn over $50 billion annually and "will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technological solutions" to companies, as reported in the company's application.
This is the division of the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment, their garage in Palo Alto being called "the place of birth of the Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is a recent development in this sector based on the belief that highly specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenala" Michael Arteta says his one-clubs should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dynamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that if Wilshire's recovery were to proceed according to plan, he would not be prevented from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most unfortunate thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire had successfully completed the previous season with the only injury to his ankle and was about to return to the conventional aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Wenger also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries in his six years since his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal league games in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal's schedule more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two premiere league clubs most missed due to injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the likelihood of being caught in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you're back in line after an injury, you're vulnerable for some time - you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of it, as well as that his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal is starting a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Héctor Belierin and Aaron Ramsey have not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debyushi and Arteth will be playing in the start-up team.
Wenger may also join Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little break to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favourite in group F, the Maximyre stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost any of the 41 games since they were able to spend last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungarian is confident that the Arsenal learned the lesson of last season when the team was defeated in the game of the Monaco Champion League, and remains with little hope of leading the club to win the finals of the Champion Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men's need for frankness has become, now more than ever, given that the suicide rate among young men is at its peak in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an effort to understand the problem of "Campaign against an Unhappy Life," the year 2015 was declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is in the middle of this battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression revealed that if the patient has a large enough number of "normal" friends, the chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chances of mental disorder.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it needs to be.
In an era where communication is managed by social networks, where style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than meaningful communication.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if the reality is solitude.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the video game maker, recently pointed out, you can't buy any more happiness with money.
Friends have the privilege of attracting attention.
Each character was determined not through its work but rather through an individual who had shown himself in communication with friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hug, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' suffocation on Rachel all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritens told me: "My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal stresses how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often, men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of "live with this" is strong, as is the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to propose longer-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the low visibility of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of outsiders on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you've fully restored the set for the holiday, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
I can't guess what friendship can do in advance.
"Friends" shows on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes of "FriendsFest"
Dee Maria hits the goal by helping SPG defeat Malmo.
Angel di Maria celebrates full balls at the Malmeu gate, on an equal footing with Blues Matüidi and Edinson Cavanaugh.
Angel de Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed SPG to easily bypass Malmeu on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavanaugh did their job when Paris St. Germain started his game in the Champion League with a very convenient 2-0 victory against Malmo at Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Dee Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champion League started as a SPG player to give direction to France's champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavanie scored the goal for 61 minutes.
In addition to Real Madrid and the donetic Schachter in group A, Paris needed to start a good start against Sweden's champions, as they were not aiming at the qualification of playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They scored points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and to replace him later on in the game against a team from his home town and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at the Champion League, so winning at 2:0 is a good start, even if there are other things we need to finish during the season," Blanc said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, even though I wish we'd scored one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after being injured in one of the replacements on the Paris team, which brought her a two-second draw in a match with Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back to Di Maria's back in the fourth minute.
The Argentine assailant was identified as a player capable of bringing the SPG to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran to pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmeu's defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected a light and big victory from the SPM then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmeu, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two proxies in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicola Giurgic's blow, when the ball flew past the far edge of Kevin Trapp's gate for 34 minutes, they attacked very little.
At the same time, SPM has at times failed itself with failed broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who only in the first half failed to execute at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball that Kavani had scored as soon as the game resumed.
However, he proved to be much more effective in the exact pass, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, receiving which, De Maria sent the ball with a twisted blow, which went to the bar by Vilanda for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after a time mark thanks to Kavani, and Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich fixed the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmo had about getting back into the game, and it was only Wiland's close-distance interception that prevented David Louis from increasing his final account before Essegyel Lavessi's replacement scored the goal at the very end of the match.
Malma Coach Aga Hareida later admitted that PSG was a class higher than his team, with a Norwegian saying, "Our last game in the League of Champions was last December."
Since then, we've only played Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Glory to the Paris!
It was a wonderful match with them.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed in an official report on Tuesday that China's head Xi Jinping will be on an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, Xi Qinping's first visit to Washington, D.C., will take place on 25 September and will be a follow-up visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will also receive Xi Jinping with Peng Liyuan's wife at a government luncheon the same evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the US and China on general, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as to enable the Presidents of the United States and China to address the controversial issues constructively," the report states.
Xi Jinping, whose first visit was announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading American technology companies on their way to Washington, D.C., and then travel to New York to participate in the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington ' s concerns about China ' s alleged cyber-spionage and China ' s growing categoricalness in the controversial South China Sea area.
The stabbing biker at Kutuzov Lihac received two years of the colony.
In addition, the Court granted partial satisfaction to the civil claims of the victims against Denis Mirzoyev for an amount of 1.2 million roubles.
The Dorogomilovsky court in Moscow sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on the Kutuzov Prospect in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He was found guilty under the article entitled "Violation of traffic regulations and the operation of vehicles" of the Criminal Code.
In addition, the Court granted part of the civil claims of 1.2 million rubles to the victims.
In the course of the parties ' deliberations, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that the victims ' claims be fully recovered - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on 22 May at around 3 a.m. in the vicinity of house 30 on the Kutuzov Prospect.
The BMW, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the opposite lane and hit a side-by-side motorcyclist.
The man died on the spot in 1989 as a result of his injuries.
The victim's friends on social media reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at a high speed and was on his way to the front of the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape responsibility, the bikers set up a race from the Sparrow Mountains to the Moscow GUMVD building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation following the interrogation had detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
A naked man was detained in Moscow.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any unlawful acts, and the police handed him over to the doctors of emergency psychiatric care.
The Metropolitan Police detained a resident of Moscow, who entered a temple without clothes.
This is reported by Moscow.
According to Andrei Galiakberov, head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, 15 September, around 4 p.m., on the Kashir highway.
A naked man entered the temple of the Saint Nicholas.
He acted calmly and did not commit any unlawful acts.
A police outfit arrived at the call site.
Law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the Emergency Mental Health Brigade and handed over to them a man.
They were found to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of Tumen province, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the Presidium of the Regional Government.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds for educational and health institutions in municipalities in the province.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for a school in the Nizhnetavdin district and for the major renovation of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major repairs to the second floor of the therapeutic unit.
The hot and cold water supply networks, drainage, power grids and electrical installations, ventilation systems, the facade of the building will be repaired, the premises will be renovated, and a range of fire safety and energy conservation measures will be implemented.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, with the participation of a delegation of Turkmenistan headed by the Governor.
The forthcoming Sochi event and the interim outcome of the cooperation are described by the distinguished Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumen, Vladimir Shugl, who joined the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions - important links of relations between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to participate in the plenary meeting.
The plenary and breakout sessions will deal with the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and legal provisions and the programmes of the Federal State.
The panel will be addressed by the Governor of the Tumen region.
I believe that this demonstrates successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also come to the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be available.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new and beneficial contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At that time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also demonstrated by the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumen under the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, a delegation of APC from the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in agricultural training, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, the issue was the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus under current difficult conditions.
The question of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms would be raised - they were needed to reduce the cost of machines to the end-user.
The problems in the work of the Belyshina trading house in Turkmenistan and the options for preventing loss were discussed.
Issues are important, as investment projects must work well and generate profits for the region.
Reference was made to the continued supply of MAZA passenger and cargo equipment, the development of the MAZ OAO service centre, which had been established in Tumen on the basis of TATP.
The meeting also covered preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of the discussion was the conclusion and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the province of Tyumen and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promise to rise to a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional centre.
In a meeting with Tumen City's chief of staff, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on their ladans, so a new batch of cars from Belarus will be required to work on gas, clean fuels.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator plant is cooperating with one of the leading manufacturers of the Mogilevliftmash elevator products, receiving components.
In my view, this activity could become more active, given the programmes to install new elevators in the regional centre.
As part of the consul ' s expanded powers, a meeting was held with Alexei Kokorin, Governor of Kurgan province, during which an increase in the turnover and supply of modern Belarusian machinery in Zaural was discussed.
A meeting with the Omi Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tumen can be described as the county headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of honorary gennosules.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in terms of addressing many problems directly and quickly, reducing their severity and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to break the gap while continuing to work ahead.
Matt Damon is opposed to focusing on the ethnic diversity of people working in film production.
Matt Damon argued with an African-American producer, Effy Brown, claiming behind the scenes that there was no need to consider ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black character in the design scenario.
"A variety is appropriate when you're casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Scattered Brown, not believing her ears, horribly cried, "Wow, wow, well, well," all the time a Marsian actor was making comments on the air.
The finalists of the show, Damon and Brown, joined the co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers to discuss the show.
"I'd like participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what they're going to do about Harmony," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute being beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film, "Dear White People," advocated that the film be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "in the end, we can get the wrong thing."
After the discussion was aired on television, social media blew up by unwelcome comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the video: "Explanation of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room TAKO HONEY, which hurts."
Tweet scored over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "Likes."
Damon's remarks come at a time when a well-informed media coverage of race is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a young man named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the coloured population.
In February, singer Prince mentioned the movement during the presentation of the nominees for the "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be considered a group of haters.
"Black Lives Matters is a group of love," reported the leaders of the movement.
It has recently been announced that Damon is on the list of artists of show business, producers and media mugs invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation or whether he met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior awards the first champion
The professional rock climber and waiter's assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
On this sport show, which season 7 has just ended, none of the participants have been able to complete all phases of the road with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two participants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to perform the mission and met the deadline, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior," which was an exhausting phase 4, but Kaldiero did the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After winning with great effort, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with "E!News."
"To think of it incredible, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac commented to journalists E!
And all of a sudden, this... I never even imagined how it was going to be... the future is unknown.
Executive Producer Kent Weed met with the journalists "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, won't get any money prize.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
"If the final players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a change of life, it still receives great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of excited reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The "America Ninja Warrior" show will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are going quietly around the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now the last in the American League's central division.
Just pretending to be an obstacle, the Tigers won with glitter on Tuesday from Minnesota Twins with a total of 5-4 on Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to cut half-game from Houston Astros and take second place in playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, even for one night, it was a return to the letter F, which slipped them most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they work," reported the Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, resulting in Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good numbers," said Simon.
The pitchers can't quit every game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, the designated Tigers chopper, managed to take three hits and scored two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since the four strikes against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with a bat," said Osmus.
He has shown himself well in (the quality of the batter) and has a distinctly better job as a bat, and he has preserved this quality for the game.
Three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning gave Twins their best chance of getting back into the game.
Central host Byron Buxton discovered an inning double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bow, took over the first base, and the second baseman, Brian Dosier, got a strike out from Simon before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy beat Moira, the only player on the road, before Miguel Sano's newly appointed chopper, who knocked out a two-ran single to the left of the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not in the outboard and a comparison wound at VerHagen's second base, he managed to bring Trevor Pluff's third baseman to the double strip.
It was the 27th time for the top league player in the season when Pluff hit the ball on the double strip.
After Detroit added a back-up wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned the RBI a "dub" between the outsiders against Bruce Rondon's closing pitcher, and the bill was 5-4.
However, the right-wing player kicked Sano out after three strikes and got his fifth seeve.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was temporarily out of practice, at the beginning of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured until the game, missing more than a month due to the inflammation of the lumbar.
"Definitely not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game evolved, I felt more comfortable, and so I was able to do some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first bat got to first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wook at two outfits of Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez out, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with runners in their final position.
The third base player, Nick Castellanos, followed by a single, causing another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to approach third base, thus eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the score in the second inning by receiving a one-a-way "dual" from James McCann's Catcher and a two-a-out "single" from central stabbing Anthony Goes, which is 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit me very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw in an unsuspected third-inning glasses, and was replaced by a law-abiding relicist, A.J. Ahter.
Hughes count three wounds on six hits and a woke with four strike outs.
Note: Pitcher is the right-wing Tygers Anibal Sanchez left the players due to the stretching of the right shoulder.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who was doing Sanchez's shoulder surgery back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, the left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the trauma list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who had left the Tigers four times since it was acquired in exchange for David Price's left-handed pitcher on July 30, has one win and one defeat.
He did not participate in the games since August 20th due to the sprain of the muscle.
Tigers and Twins will finish a series of three games on the Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2 ERA 4.43) will play the pitcher of Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint about the book of Prayer to God came before the South Sahel Court.
The South Sahalin City Court received the original appeal of President Chechnya's representative Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to accept "extremist material" of the book Prayer to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam, reports Interfax with reference to the Chief Justice Alexander Chuhrai.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the allegations made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation that there was a need to test the authorities for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahel City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalie Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as "extremist material."
The South Sahalinsk Public Prosecutor ' s Office filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that they have asked the court to declare extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not the verses of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chuhrai said.
The decision to accept the book as "extremist material" was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were quoted from the Quran, "We worship you and pray to You for help," and "Do not call upon anyone along with God."
Kadyrov called the decision makers of the book "Satans and Provocateurs."
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit by law judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma must adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly relating to the Koran and other divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to delete posts and comments that are negative for migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
The Facebook leadership is working with the German Ministry of Justice to combat xenophobia and racism on the network.
On the previous day, the Head of Department, Haiko Maas, had stated that the mini-just was currently working with social media professionals to establish a special group of moderators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove incorrect comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of the non-Terrorant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their records.
Organizations whose expertise is involved in collecting complaints from social media users about abusive posts should also facilitate the operational blocking of illegal content.
The Facebook leadership intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments against migrants and refugees by the German social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after xenophobic sentiment had dramatically increased in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that affected the countries of the European Union some time ago.
Germany, for example, is already overcrowded in all places intended to accommodate refugees.
The previous day, the authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants in the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are accommodated in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war are held under the Nazi regime.
Relaxation areas will appear in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several major cemeteries are equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological recreation.
Among the first will be Butovsky, Domodedov, and Shcherbin cemetery.
The first psychological rest zone has already appeared at the Troekurovsk cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will also be available in other parts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, Head of the State Budget Institution "Ritual," described this portal to m24.ru.
Relaxation zones will be small green areas similar to parks.
According to experts, in such corners, cemetery visitors will be able to rest, be alone and recover psychological strength.
Relaxation zones will soon be built in Domodedov, Butov and Shcherbin Cemeteries and later in other parts of the capital.
According to the Ritual chapter of the GBU, if there is a need to extend the cemetery area, the builders will try to preserve existing forests to the maximum extent possible.
The green stands will serve as a living fence that will separate the rest areas and the areas allocated directly to burial sites.
Ritual GBU experts have also indicated their intention to propose the abandonment of fences at graves.
New cemeteries can really become barrierless.
In addition, the Ritual GBU reported on its readiness to install electronic terminals to enable cemetery visitors to access GPS coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So, digging graves in summer time will cost a thousand rubles less, weeks in winter, when the earth is freezing.
Note that over the past year, the cost of all kinds of ritual services has averaged 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungus was found in the forests of Elnin.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours without provisions in the forest.
It was thanks to the combined efforts of rescue workers and volunteers to detect the disaster.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There weren't even dog movies, but there was no result.
It was possible to locate the man after a helicopter entered the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to get the stains and subpoenas, but he did not return by the evening.
The family immediately sought help, and the following day, rescue workers and people from a nearby village - only about 30 people - were raised to search for the fungus.
They were joined for the fifth day by a helicopter from the fire and rescue centre.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolen District Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in, the man was found."
He's gone a long way, a completely different place.
It was about 12 kilometres away from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
The miracle is still alive.
The Mushrooms were taken to the Elnin Central District Hospital unconscious, in extremely difficult condition.
Medical patients diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
As an elderly man was able to survive after five days in the woods, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the medical department of the Elnin CRS: "The patient is scheduled to be examined, the treatment."
Infusion therapy, anti-bacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, but it's still heavy, but it's positive.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolenshchina from the Tambov region every year.
His grandson says his grandfather used to go to pick mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the fungus found, said: "The forest is not far from the road, it is not in principle local."
I've been visiting my family for years.
Well, I went for the mushrooms.
Guess he went a little far and got lost.
As the mushroom season begins, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In the past few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Squads remind us that you need to wear bright clothes, with little food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to keep track of ourselves so that we can then go back.
The Ahn-2 crashed into a secret in a brotherly saddle.
Straight through, he sat down in Siberia. An-2 emergency.
An Enisei flight of the Russian airline of Yenisei landed on an emergency basis 68 kilometres from Brassk.
There were no fatalities or casualties, but the plane itself sustained extensive damage when it landed.
An-2 was on a service flight.
There were three crew members on board, the commander, the co-pilot and the mechanic, reporting to Interfax.
The aircraft flew along the Zheleznogorsk-Ilimski-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The aircraft crew has already arrived in Brassk.
The Bra's Transport Prosecutor's Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with the aviation safety legislation.
An investigation team from the East Siberia Transport Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers because of a technical malfunction at the abandoned Thai airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics were denied on the ship, but the crew did the impossible.
The aircraft consisted of 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
♪ The Nobel Laureate: Globalization ♪
The process of globalization should have helped to reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in the emerging economies is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of NIEU, Nobel Prize winner in Economics, 2007.
In the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," Maskin points out.
China and India, for example, have experienced strong per capita GDP growth.
However, it's not all so radiant.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the "poor" and the "poor" in poor countries, which is reflected in large income inequality, and more specifically in wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in emerging economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by INE.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that shows why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization increases, and reminds the NEE of the NEE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate these, Maskin singles out four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries lack the skills to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries get paid up through cooperation with B-level employees from rich countries, D-level workers don't feel or their salaries fall at all.
The ultimate effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to widening the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus to increasing inequality.
Kramer and E. Maskin proposed an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Rikardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, " says Fuad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Making, head of the Department of Mathematics of the NIEU.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will trigger empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, according to the scientist, do not have the means to do so, and companies do not have the means to pay for their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scientist notes that the theory that has been developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and is bearing fruit in the form of growth in the GDP of countries.
Derbent: A living bond of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, is celebrating its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the event programme, the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and the historic fair, the exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, the historical and music show "2000 years in two hours" and the guided tour of the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
The medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and the palace gardens - it's like they're off the pages of "A thousand and one night."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantine, Hazara Caganate, and the Golden Ord.
The age of the eastern shears, which grow in the yard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian programme "The Trees - Monuments of Nature."
The shadow of rocky crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque will be given a scented cup of tea and will be given to Dagestan treats such as honey figs, hurma, mushmula, chocolate cakes, Ayran and sweets.
Derbent has been using large samovars for centuries to drink tea for numerous guests.
The sign above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says the building was built in 115H.
That is, in 733, the Gregorian calendar.
This is Russia's oldest mosque.
The interior is astounded by the scale and solemnity of the seams of the swimmers and herbs, which are based on square columns and lighted by the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional fascination of Derbent's inhabitants.
Homebird owners put pigeons in the yard, under the trees, in the attic.
An exciting sight is the take-off into the sky of a pack of white pigeons like the flashes of a holiday fireworks.
In order to defend themselves against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
By going 500 meters into the sea, the building locked Derbent's harbour.
In 2003, Derbent ' s fortress walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument to the ancient Persian Fortification Building.
The carpets in Derbent were weaving back in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the urban market, carpets are sold for any taste - wool, cotton, or whirlwinds of all colours and shades, with and without wolves, with a complex ornament and a whim.
==History==The city began with a single-storey stone building.
Over the years, the magicians have barely changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval city but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, parts of a plumbing built by the Persians about a thousand years ago were preserved.
To date, ancient sources have reached the point where the locals are still gathering water today.
Many Derbents prefer conventional tap water to water from verified historical fountains.
Derbent had one of the pottery centres.
The irrigation and porcipal vases, dishes, jars, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters are still making wonderful ceramics, both practical and souvenir.
During the holidays and festivals, crowds of viewers gather under a tight rope, which is attended by students of the Republican School of Circus Arts.
The history of amazing and risky skill spans several centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the network.
There's a museum called Culture and Old Derbent in the former Girl Bani's building today.
In the past, single girls and brides were washed around with friends, and now anyone who wants to see a tight-wall hall, hot and cold swimming pools that have gone past bathing supplies.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and steam are as popular these days as they were in the old days.
The benefits of steaming the body are written in old books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose their fatigue, and the body becomes flexible and light.
The Commonwealth festival, which is held in the Naryn Kala fortress, is attended by ethnic groups in many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing songs from the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious home cheese.
Kirkhlar is the burial site of 40 martyrs who have developed their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most venerable complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
From time to time the sarcophagus have been cut out from whole stone blocks and are oriented, as the Arabs do, along the axis of the West-East.
The Gavril and Albert Yakubova brothers shave and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barber's been in this place for years.
Cyrcial crafts are passed on from generation to generation.
In doing so, the Jakubova brothers can do not only traditional but also modern hairstyles.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which Alexander Bestuchev-Marlinsky, a decabrist writer, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described the Derbent of the first third of the nineteenth century with his ancient monuments, life and household.
Teahan is a traditional club in the East where only tea and homemade baking are served.
Men come here to satisfy their thirst, to communicate with their friends, and to solve some work problems.
As in past times, women are not encouraged to cross the threshold of tea.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already been able to take part in activities at the republican and Russian levels.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfecting the people's Avar, Dargin, Tatian and Armenian dances.
As the evening begins, when noise subsides and streetlights light up, local residents sit on shops near houses with terraces.
As a rule, they discuss domestic matters.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly reminiscent of the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
There was a business game at Domodedov.
The capital is experiencing a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried to be airport staff.
For this purpose, three aircraft harbour models were installed at Domodedov.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
It's all in the form of a business game, but it's not as complex as reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the stairs lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in Domodedov's hangar, it's a standard set of tasks to be done by new recruits.
In one hangar, three major airports from around the world were located.
There are now four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the air harbour.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - even buses in the airfield, stairs and passenger inspection were entrusted to them.
And the passengers are in trouble.
One of them had a mess of documents, the other one was late for the flight, and the third one filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with all of this, like in life, in a minimum period of time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual cash, as if they had been paid by the airline for the maintenance of the flight.
"For failing to do the tasks, they will be fined," explains Dmitri Hilko's financial analyst in an interview with the "Vesti-Moscow" program.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of learning.
She's already found a place in secondary vocational education.
"Six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will become essentially new models of the operation of modern colleges with modern management systems, with highly qualified personnel and with modern equipment," says the Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of labour training and additional vocational training of the Ministry of Labour and Science of the Russian Federation, Natali Zolareva.
But the students aren't up to global plans.
After three days of training, they're gonna need a day off.
At the same time, the grades for this examination were quite material.
The newest smarts, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely fashion to our airport claim at Instagram," satisfied with the player, the PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, what's called, were taken into a pencil to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the United States Centre for Foreign Literature at the Library.
The Centre has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library M. I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the Russian Government's commitment to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments in the long history of our relations," states the statement of United States Ambassador John Tefft at the Interfax.
The American Centre has built deep and strong links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," emphasized the diplomat.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal proved to be quick to kill.
A typical situation: the four officials are standing before Judge Swatanter Kumar ' s desk, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is completely unsatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of him," Kumar says.
If one more brick is placed, we'll order the demolition of all existing structures.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to hear more than 10,000 claims relating to air pollution, garbage collection, geological exploitation, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the pollution-induced construction.
The stakes are incredibly high: India has become one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world in the short 60 years since the independence of enhanced industrial development.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smogs, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and few of the remaining dwellings are cut off to new residential neighbourhoods.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May of this year, the Minister of the Environment referred to the court's decisions as "extreme" and "unimplementable."
Sometimes the court ' s decisions cannot be executed within the court ' s time limit, and Raj Panjwani ' s environmental lawyer confirms.
However, the impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," added counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly cancelled major constructions: the cessation of the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
People are also being kept in mind: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagna, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," commented on Kumar's decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by a single stroke of a judiciary pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over the age of 10 from entering the capital, thus causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Government of New Delhi on incoming and outgoing vehicles, as well as a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses prior to finding out in factories whether they were in a position to carry out such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents began to reach the court ' s attention, popular anger began to subside slightly.
But the most painful topic for a principled judge was the Gang River clean-up programme announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone spilled water from Gang to God's statue, and there were feces in it, the judge is hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think the Gang is Gang, he'll take all our sins.
It's a river we worship, and look at what you do to it every day.
Gang cleaning is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in the river is now more than 120 times higher than the norm.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Hindus bathing in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Gange Rescue Fund money from the sale of his costume, in which he met with Barak Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
The environmentalists immediately accused the premier of populism: the costume was bought for $700,000, while at least eight billion was needed to clean the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can identify itself as a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
"In a developing country, conversations about the environment are often perceived as an unfavorable luxury," says Zov Ganga activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a golden balance between ecology and development."
A man bleeds a few paintings of Dali at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Artists' Union exhibition in Riga broke the windows in the museum and ruined the El Salvador Dalí sculpture "The Origin of an Angel."
El Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso's exhibition is now taking place at the museum.
The man of 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately led the wrong way: he ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then began moving around the premises and stained with blood several works of permanent exhibition.
Among them is a portrait of the Portion of the Hand of Meervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobychin, referred to by Interfax, the windows were also damaged.
Police and art experts are present at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism had been brought against the man.
An exhibition of the works of Picasso and Dali was held in the Latvian Artists' Union from 4 August to 27 September, at which more than 200 original works of artists were presented.

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world in order to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in his address to the group that is facing the challenge of managing reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness," he said, in addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on the Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
He said that greater openness and deeper reforms would give the economy new impetus and life force and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including regulation of market access for investors, amendment of border controls, promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually fine-tuned through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business rule and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken control over the powers granted to companies, thereby guaranteeing that companies would run their own businesses.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of publicly controlled sectors of the economy.
"The Government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions," stated the statement.
In addition, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card," will be facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
