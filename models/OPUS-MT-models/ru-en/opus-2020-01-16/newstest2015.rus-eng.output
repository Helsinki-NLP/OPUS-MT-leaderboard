FANO Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia), together with RAN, will hold the third Expert Session on "Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Scientific Organizations."
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year and will be reported in a press release to Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session during the year and to draw up a final list of indicators to measure the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the closing event in a series of events to develop a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the normative instruments is being negotiated.
On the basis of the outcome of the next session, we must complete the process of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said the head of the Russian FANO, Elena Aksenov.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than 100 Russian scientific institutes.
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars.
Astrophysicists from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will allow us to search among the stars for related ones, i.e. from a single cluster.
The authors published the results of their studies in Nature magazine and are briefly available on the University ' s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas preceding the formation of the stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its place of birth and the region of creation of the related stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the models carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, supercomputer experts modelled two interstellar gas streams that together formed a cloud.
This object has been transformed into a cluster of protostars for several million years by its own gravity.
Scientists have added paint marks to the initial gas flows and have found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud has resulted in a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research shows that it is possible to search for chemically related stars and to identify possible regions of origin of such objects.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old after following a motorcycle at high speed.
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and through bushland to escape the Pilbar police.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock the door" on new sanctions and will not withdraw from WTO
Russia will not slam the door in connection with the new sanctions.
This was announced today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, in front of MGIMO students and teachers.
With regard to our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasize, because everything has to be specifically designed, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will do this time, then we will decide how to respond.
It's not gonna have to do with slamming doors, some kind of grudge, misunderstandable, the Minister stressed.
First of all, we will build on our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners with regard to their adequacy, credibility and reliability.
The steps taken in the area of sanctions are very good in judging what partners are seeking - the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation continued.
If the whole voice says that "they'll be painful for us, too, but we have to do so to punish Russia," that's probably not adequate."
With regard to the WTO, the Russian Federation has not withdrawn in response to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, " stated Lavrov.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is a discriminatory EU anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping while applying anti-dumping measures against the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position that the rules of the third EU energy package should not be applied retroactively," Lavrov said.
How do you use a siren in a garden design?
Irene Okuneva answers questions:
Since the lignite loses its main appeal after blooming, it is desirable to plant it along with other shrubs.
It fits perfectly with many cultures.
And you can and should plant both plants that are decorative at different times, and flowers that bloom at the same time.
Another thing is, the sirens are that they offer a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a strain tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a broad base, and even like a garden bonsai - a tree with a fancy curved trunk.
Just select the shape that fits your garden design more closely.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad province was convicted of selling counterfeit money.
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in criminal fishing in the Oloneck and Segez regions.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused had already succeeded in inheriting in Vologoda province, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
Later, the man appeared before the Oloneck District Court.
In order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Sageju.
In the course of the investigation, guilt has been proven in several episodes of counterfeit money sales related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file with the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the sentence with four years ' imprisonment while serving in a general-regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Remember, last week, two more counterfeit money dealers were convicted and paid at Petrozavodsk's stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One is imprisoned for five years and the other for four years.
Each one has a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The sentence also has not yet entered into force.
Archangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first Dervis convoy.
The rally, which took place at the regional centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis delivered military assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Archangelsk, a memorial meeting took place near the stone of the future monument to the northern convoys, which is located on Sedov ' s shore name in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of the veterans ' organizations of Archangelsk, children from the Kadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago, when a mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea," noted Boris Karpov, chairman of the North Sea Veteran Council.
The event was followed by a performance by an urban spirit orchestra, and cadet students gave flowers to veterans and marched with Russian flags and the sign of victory.
The meeting ended with the assignment of flowers to the mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, tin, wool and many other tools and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and weapons were also on board, with 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, and 15 Harrikein fighter aircraft, in a decommissioned condition.
At the same time, the convoy consisted of 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not discovered by the enemy and reached its destination, Archangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 vehicles and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Allison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that protects union organization as a civil right.
"Where are the unions, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chaires the Congress of the Progressive Thrace.
That's why I'm proud to present the Workers Empowerment Act with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities to discriminate against the organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to enable workers facing discrimination in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and penalties - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the co-writers are offering is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his associates helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
While recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans have included an article that explicitly states: "The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to everyone and to every profession or activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures aimed at this purpose will be deemed illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "Everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend his interests."
For generations, Americans have taken as due the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country consulted other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to have the union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the union movement didn't undermine the nation's power, but it increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions have created a wonderful market for industry and raised a whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and increased protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis are rekindling ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily block a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of Louisiana's law on Sunday, which his supporters say is likely to close down all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana, Bobby Ginadle, in June, and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could continue to perform legal abortions to date, while continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing to act to obtain authority," wrote Judge John DeGravells in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month, at which time the judge will render a more permanent decision on the law.
Lawyers of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
"Today's decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from the treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northap, President and Head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a motion to stop the operation of the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who had not filed a complaint in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is a member of 11 states that have passed such laws, and the courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Lawyers for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that admission laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who had abortions in Louisiana had the authority to take them to the hospital, reported the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would cease doing so, said the team.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana's officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission powers were pending.
What the introduction of quotas for domestic products will do
At least half of the products for each product in the range of trade networks should be Russian-made, according to the deputy of the State Duma of the "A Fair Russia" faction, Oleg Nealov.
The parliamentarian had drafted a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, and he had written the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort to customers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia; for the rest of the products produced in Russia, the rhythmor will have to provide at least half of his shelves to domestic producers," reported Nilov to the publication.
The draft law, together with amendments to the article on the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation, provides for an amendment to the Tax Code, which establishes a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There'll be several times more domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Nalogovic's lawyer, Sergei Litvinenko, a member of the independent expert centre "Public Duma," for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
The positive ones are farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the routers, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, leading to higher taxes than before.
This will increase fiscal revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will become more absorbent, and there will be a contribution to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, but not immediately," the expert notes.
In the past, Russian enterprises were often unable to break into local stores because of high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been freed and can be sighed at with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary negotiations and sanitary checks, the Russian market will be supplied with food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, now is the moment of silence when the former players have left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Nearly a month later, we can talk about increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products," Aife.ru told the first Vice-President of the Russian-wide public organization, Russian Club of Financial Directors, C.E. Tamara Kasyanov.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category will help to secure the sector for local producers.
In that case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were less expensive at the expense of subsidies from another State.
In other words, the competition for the buyer will spread among companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova points out that Russian producers are not able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots in all ways.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to reach half the range of Russian goods.
In this regard, there is growing concern that the counters will be supplied with poor quality goods.
Foreign products with broken labels may be presented under the guise of Russian production," added the expert.
The negative effects of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from working with importers.
It was logical that foreign suppliers themselves would be affected by such a arrangement, as demand for their products would decline.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported ones, while shops may be able to raise prices for the second, as in the case of a deficit.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was reiterated by economists in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of a difficult relationship with the West, the issue of the abandonment of imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The purpose of the law is to make it incumbent upon the distributors to treat domestic producers when making orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confident on the route of import substitution, and the production planning system for the required products will be put in place in a shorter time frame," says MP Oleg Nealov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are actually able to cover all the counters of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can provide a powerful boost.
It is known that the largest share of imports remains in beef, ranging from 30 to 35 per cent.
So 65-70% is still Russian products," Kasyanov says.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas for domestic products would facilitate and accelerate import substitution.
However, this initiative alone will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50 per cent of the products sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that no full import substitution will take place, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
Moreover, it was not enough to set quotas, and there was still a need to produce domestic products in the country in order to meet those quotas.
These quotas are the kind of guarantees that will be provided," the expert notes.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Rural women in Australia face a higher risk of ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent had lived five years after the diagnosis.
Susan Jordan, a leading researcher at the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research, reported that the probability of dying during the study is 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
NARRATOR: New drugs can slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, current illnesses and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology, and they're mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improvements in telemedical services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programmes for people who were receiving treatment far from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that the long life expectancy of women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elise Niamh, said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the doors in Kugener district.
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktabellak began in April of this year and was conducted under a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head Mary El, funding for the construction of the facility was provided from the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility is almost 230 square metres.
This will provide medical care to the inhabitants of eight localities: Toktaibellak and Dementevo villages, Püncherumal, Tuña, Fomichi, Toraybellak, Shinur and Chashayal villages.
The new paramedic and midwifery unit will replace the existing PAF, which was built in 1918 and has long run out of its resources and does not meet sanitation requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killer of a four-month-old child in a drunken state, the New Boxer will stand trial.
Duvash's resident will be on trial for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksar, a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarska, accused of causing death through negligence, was completed.
The investigation found that, on 26 July this year, the accused, along with a four-month-old son, had come to celebrate the birth of her kuma child in Cheboksara.
After a long meal, the New Bowl decided to stay and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and cried at night, a drunk woman put it next to her bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman attacked her son, resulting in his death from suffocation.
Criminal case, reported by the SKR Press Service for Dhuwashia, sent to court.
Inflation's out of vacation.
Will Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-border sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not settle in the forecasts of the authorities, and ITB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of the sanctions will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the Ministry of Economic Development ' s latest forecast, inflation will be 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014 and 6.5 per cent in the following year.
However, according to Commersant, this week the IEG is expected to make "small but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic outlook before 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can reduce inflation estimates for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected decline in income growth.
The forecast assumed that Russian food sanctions were in force for the year until August 2015.
How could inflation be so high in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change," said the source of the Minfin newspaper.
The ITB Capital economists do not share the government's expectations of inflation and are projecting a price increase of 8 per cent in 2014.
The main impact of product bans will come along with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SDP) in 2015 in the Russian Federation regions, and experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will take place in February, after which the annual price growth rate will decline, the experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat came up with the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced "smooth sanctions."
AIF.ru interviewed the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Chief of Analysis, FC AForex:
Price increases have already been observed in major segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government had to initiate systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent risks of undue price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and routers already report on a daily basis to regulators to ensure that the authorities know exactly who initiates price increases, when and for what reason.
The enormous rate of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-governor, internal conversion due to foreign currency flight, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia continue to be key factors in the growth of the consumer price index.
If inflationary pressures were kept under control, the cost of a basket of a minimum set of products would not have jumped 12% per quarter.
The ban on the importation of food products has triggered a supply shock on the domestic market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in final value.
As we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism at this stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions response will continue to carry the risks of inflationary growth.
If we add fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30 per cent per month; in zero, it was also above current levels; in another case, it was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year-end inflation is 8 to 8.5%.
Plato Maguta, Manager of the assets of the CC Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if pressure is further increased, particularly on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually manifested in the purchase of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth reduction of rubles, both by market methods and by public regulation.
But price increases have traditionally begun after the summer slackening and may become more pronounced this fall.
The target consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5 per cent is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres grieve at the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach "the basic age of horticulture," according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, renters spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It refers to the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting the courtyards in front of the parking house, and the reduction of the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, Britain's lowest level of spending on horticultural goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser to RHS, said, "The cultivation of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of horticultural retail trade, as a result of the increase in homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year as a result of better weather following the adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out mass cleaning in the Landage Foundation
Three of the four Chiefs of the Land Administration Foundation were replaced as early as Friday.
In total, three of the four Land administration directors were replaced as early as Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Dobrov.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were quietly replaced on Friday.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelov, who until then had been in charge of State assistance and the SAPARD programme, has been released and reports to BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I wasn't present at the board of directors of the foundation because by law we're not members of the board, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal isn't reported on the fund's website.
I'm on vacation.
"I hope I find out more on Monday," said Angel's edition.
Her seat will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who has so far been the head of the Investment Credit at the Central Foundation in Landeldelia in Sofia.
The Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, he had been responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
Zivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landadelia Foundation in the city of Grand Tarnovo until January 2014, will be appointed to his seat.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Atije Aliyev-Veli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey calls an American diplomat in connection with a report of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent reported that the United States Chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials had discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has downplayed the importance of this report by saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
The information previously reported that the German main intelligence agency had also made Ankara a subject of intelligence has led to a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The biggest Chinese companies united against Alibaba
China's largest commercial real estate developer in China, the Dalian Wanda Group and the Tencent Holdings Internet giants (social networks, messinger et al.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade with Alibaba.
However, it will be difficult to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com.
Union of Majors
Companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan (814 million), 70% of it will be owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
The company is planned to register in Hong Kong.
SP will combine the Bidu search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fancy hotels, Wanda manages at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 trading centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic entertainment park in Qindao (a town in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate $960 million in profits.
In addition, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings, making the company the largest camera operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its trading centres, hotels and entertainment sites with e-commerce services, which will be developed by a rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, marked by Dong-Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract customers on the Internet to come to regular offline shops or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," said Wanda Van Jianlin, the leader of Bloomberg.
"There is no real O2O site in China now, and in this situation the chances are roughly equal," he says.
China's Internet trade market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, providing Bloomberg with official statistics: this is the largest population anywhere in the world except India.
And it is projected that this number will rise to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the Richest
Tencent Ma Huaten's head was until recently China's richest man, but according to Bloomberg's millionaire index, Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, has already passed it by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is in his share in Alibaba.
==History==Baidu leader Robin Lee is now ranked third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is ranked fourth.
"Bloomberg said the director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Commerce at Hangzhou Tsao Lei.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba right after creation: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not so easily competing not only with new companies but also with the well-deserved leaders of the world's Internet trade is evidenced by the report published the previous day on Alibaba's financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but between April and June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net return for the period was almost twice that of the total competitors - almost tripled in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential for generating money, largely thanks to her mobile applications," commented Bloomberg's report by an analyst from Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the Alibaba Update on the US Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company ' s services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March figure (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were made by mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of her shares before IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the stock sale.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place on 16 September.
The road-show of the company that preceded the event was launched on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's release to IPO will be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
So far, the record for US stock exchanges was owned by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made its initial equity position at $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trade networks should be Russian-made, as the deputies of the State Duma believe.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
These include amendments to article 8 of the Federal Code on the basis of the State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, of at least 50 per cent of domestic products produced in shops should be for each type of product.
However, the document will bear in mind that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so that they will be given a "ski" to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of all food products originating in Russia, as reported by the newspaper Izvestia.
On 27 August, a draft law was submitted to the lower house of Parliament to amend the FZ "On Retail Markets," which proposes the re-establishment of farmers' markets in Russia in which small producers can market their products.
The Chief of Police of Magaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Malorca on Friday.
The Chief of the Calvia Police on Malorca resort island was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous centre of Magalufe's unbridled drunkenness.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballén, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to a daily online publication by Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office of Malorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard for corruption charges and will be questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said that protectionism by the authorities was seriously affecting their businesses.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Our sources of existence should not be compromised.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer blowing 24 men during a bar race.
The island authorities have since tried to stop drunken hooliganism among Magaluf's resters, minimizing the scandalous amount of alcohol running through bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage bar organizers together were fined $55,000 ($73,000).
Magaluf tourist resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, has also been the scene of numerous alcohol-intoxication accidents associated with mad fun known as balconing, when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another five mm rain fell on the city by 9 p.m., following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short storms with a gusty wind, including a storm that began just before 8 p.m. and spilled almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave out an early spring last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Squidist conditions are believed to have contributed to the delay in the landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but was caught in a wind shift - a sudden change of speed or a short-range direction of wind - and was forced to climb.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to reach altitude during the second landing, and the plane finally landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused subsequent delays in several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected at Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two rains.
The Russian Federation ' s construction projects will be estimated in a new way
Pricing, building industry regulation, and connectivity issues are subject to special control by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
An expert board for the development of competition in the construction sector has been established under FAS.
At its meeting, FAS Vadim Soloviev, Head of the Directorate for Control of HKH, Construction and Natural Resources, stated that "the current estimate of construction facilities is completely unclear."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and may lead to an unreasonable construction price, considered by the FAS.
And they offer the cost of building public utilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, design solutions instead of current estimates and unit rates for technological operations.
These proposals have been included in the road map and are now under consideration in the mine.
"Replacement of traditional construction estimates to design design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained RRT by Vadim Soloviev.
Indeed, every bolt and nut are now included in the estimates, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, bad-faith construction companies can bury "the whole tractors."
Minstrøy and FAS agree.
"The first steps in moving towards the calculation of cost by design elements are already in place: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of design solutions, to make estimates for these indicators," said RRT, the head of the Department of Urban Development and the architecture of the Minstrium, Elena Zhukov.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As GRB's head of the ProFi-Invest construction company, Anatoly Demianco, explained, estimates have long been outdated, but no other mechanism has yet been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations of structural elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, as construction of buildings often uses very different technologies," he considers.
It's no secret that the builder's development is largely due to a government order.
According to Catherine Lezina, Chairman of the NP's "Expert Community of Government Professionals," today the state is the most solvent customer.
Rosatoma Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering of the Capital Construction Centre, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competence and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that a transparent market could be created only if access to contracts was as secure as possible from someone ' s managing influence.
On the board of experts, it was suggested that a system of government orders should be established in such a way that the same perpetrator could not obtain more than one contract for more than 1 billion roubles or more than one contract for more than 1 billion roubles.
The Ministry of Mines believes that this approach needs to be evaluated in terms of the impact on business as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
According to Elena Zhukov, it would then be necessary to assign to the employer the functions of a general contractor, which would result in an increase in the number of requisitioners and in the budget for their maintenance.
In doing so, the requisitioner ' s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations and their safety.
Often, with this breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the departure of highly qualified public procurement participants because of the lack of interest in receiving a public order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
The vice-heads of the Expert Advisory Centre of the Procurement Institute, Alexander Evstashenkov, believe that the State order procedure has now become a business exercise for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "The applicant, when filling an application, must specify "specific indicators" without the words "or equivalent," "should be," "from," "more," "less," "like," "or," "type," "similar type," "not lower," "below," "below," "may," "may be," "may be," "be" or "not earlier," "not earlier," "not higher," "shall not be" etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to impose requirements on the content of an application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another problem of 44-FZ was the need to assess the quality of the paper proposal of the participant at the application stage.
When considering a participant ' s application, it is only the contractor ' s qualifications that can be evaluated, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been initiated, according to the expert.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
It was also suggested that the board of experts shift the margin income from the top to the bottom, so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
The chairman of the board of experts, the State Secretary, Deputy Chief FAS Andrei Czarikovsky, believes that this should not be done, since the contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, as in Arkady Rikin's famous reprise, "Athel," "Are there any claims against the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories adjacent to the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the Territory was recovering from fighting.
The beginning of school education brought joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the Pascho children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of fragments from walls and a roller coaster before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronite Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to the level of life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said she'd suddenly start going back to school "a little weird."
"It was a difficult time, and we never left our homes," she said.
President Reven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of border settlement residents, such as Saad, did not go out or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by Palestinian mines, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which was greatly spared from Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do our utmost to provide you with knowledge and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, were killed in the war, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mainly in the south.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed as a result of Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 schools, which were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the highest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, and RP data reported on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Director Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne were running a two-tier market.
RP Data shows that housing prices in Sydney have increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where prices rose on average from 5 to 6 per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost reductions were made, with prices rising by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put on sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Bearing in mind the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will rise in the next three months," he said.
How do people live in the oldest house in Upha?
In the former house of gold and mining workers Yevdokim and his son Ivan Demidov, on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Greater Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has hardly changed since the construction, except for the dilapidation.
Outsiders come here as a tour, and residents suffer more than they are happy with their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufim home, whose walls are remembered by the master Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the house's construction is inaccurate, and historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out the building is 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, squeaking stairs.
The doors to the apartments are close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the light of the plaster.
Seems like everything's on the line.
And the locals say, "You don't think so."
Living in an 18th - century wooden house is very difficult, " says Tatiana Lukianova, resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on state protection, but it hasn't been spent for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities just forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin and poor, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom on the street and bathe once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content in such circumstances?!
The road goes right under the windows, there's no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's pulling the curtain.
Now you can see what you've heard before: there's a traffic stream under the windows.
You see, the glass is always drowsy, we can't open the windows, but we're used to the noise.
A man gets used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still model, thanks to his husband, his hands are gold.
Besides, we have two rooms living together with our son.
And other families have much worse conditions, and on the second floor, the ceilings are just over a metre and a half in height.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 of Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant guest woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 per four people, so we live with my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another living space, and Ludmila's eyes are all over the room: anthresoli, two couchs with the letter "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling, there's a regular flow: the water supply system isn't good.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment in a routine and surprising way, as an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is to say, it brings into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The waterworks were carried out some 40 years ago during the last repair.
That's when they made us a little kitchen in the cot and a toilet out of the old closet.
We live exactly where Demids and his family lived on the second floor, and the servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, and why?
At the Ufah Real Estate Centre, they say privatization is irrelevant.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim any more.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle down, but it didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
There was a dynasty in this apartment: my grandparents, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and my granddaughter.
Anything's happened in that time.
Like big rats running around in the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the fligel, they're about a meter thick!
They say the solution was involved in the eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
That's probably the only reason nobody's been killed by a falling ceiling or a swaddle.
Only the building is slowly dying in front of us: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors fail repeatedly, we pour cement, but it's useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is - under our room is a secret climbing and a move to the White River, which was specially made by the old men who lived here to protect themselves from danger, in which case.
They were pursued.
Ludmila Starostina tells us how some historian came to them, begged him to start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give up their living space in exchange for his one-on-one on October.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are the four of us in the same room?
And there's a little hope here that they'll give us more space.
If we agreed to trade, we wouldn't have won anything by now.
However, the Old Ages' family won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream was to be dispersed, and a daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have set aside a two-bedroom apartment instead of the most unbelievable ruins in which two generations live now.
The handsome, miniaturistic girl Olesa Karsakov of apartment 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, a large family lives in two small rooms with a total area of 23 m2.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see the conditions.
The plaster falls off with pieces, like window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through the holes.
The tap water is only cold all year round.
As you walk through the flats of Oof's oldest house, you can see that Lavrentiev's spouses are the luckiest from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the outermost rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
It's 75 squared, and it's three people.
We live in those rooms where Suvorov was legendaryly staying during his stay in Ufa, " says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are tall, spacious.
One bad thing is, everything's crawling around the seams, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you already!
The most torment we have with the floors is that the wooden boards are rotten, the ground is literally gone from under our feet.
I've set the bars, the wedge; there's nothing in the room, and in the other room we go on swings, it's so shaky.
The house of the merchant Yevdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can speak better than any tour guide.
The gold man is regarded as his own, and he is adorable.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Uzian factories built houses, poured guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The owners of the cottage estate are proud of themselves, but they don't want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child in the 1940s, " says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths, which were subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something got in the way...
History was repeated in 2014: once again, new housing was lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran the right offices, and suddenly found out that moving to apartments was being postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something doesn't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The housekeepers didn't take it.
They sent it from one table to another, and then, in a mockery, they issued a paper without a signature or a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even feel like our house has been out of town for a long time, since it was number 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was knocked down in the '70s.
Russian Planet approached Ufa Vladimir Barabash, the head of the land administration's information and analysis sector.
The House of Oktyabrsk Revolution 57/1 is included in the settlement programme for dilapidated dwellings.
I can't be held accountable for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, but I know there was a plan at that time to demolish all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities - to rebuild all the old houses on October Revolution Street, of architectural value - has been successfully implemented.
Housing is planned to be settled in new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, the reconstruction of Demidov's house will be carried out by Italian specialists who were involved in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Italy is now hosting an architectural biennal, and the Old Ufa project is among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire old Kazakh street will be restored, " says the official.
Homes will become the right kind of place, like the one they used to be three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all.
In addition, at the governmental level, it has been decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
It's not gonna be possible on Sunday, unfortunately, for the roads to be too busy in the city.
The future museum, Vladimir Barabash, promises to settle in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied with their new apartments, which will be the same as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorje, the storm caused a forest fire
The dry storm caused a forest fire in the Hunting Field Forest in the Pozjar district of the Primorsk region.
A group of forces and means is increasing at the fire site.
According to the management of the UGCB Maritime Airbase, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Air Force Commander:
The fire in the hard-to-reach area was discovered by an observer pilot on board an An-2 patrol aircraft in 3 hectares.
The wood remains on the old burner are burning.
The severe slamming of the area and the steepness of the slope over 45 degrees, the absence of landing landing areas for fire landings pose significant difficulties in fighting.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the force by an MI-2 helicopter and AN-2 aircraft at the airbase is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, four fire-fighting parachutes were promptly planted at the scene.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-fighting equipment.
Three additional firemen were transported by helicopter to the village of Homicide in the area of lunchtime.
Once the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, the specialists will be moved to the site of the fighting and reported on the website of the Maritime Administration.
My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, "Rare Rudi records," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are vibrant.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "many" treatments, and Henry often thinks about his father's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to see what his life must have been.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, deep labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father was in the bathtub and just lying there, and you heard him sing slowly to himself because he wanted to wash away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized he'd been doing it for years and years to earn our living, and I appreciated him more.
However, Henry had left childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he missed when he was a kid.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he married for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got very, very well, and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he got a confession of critics for his Othello, he's been all over the theater.
It was followed by "Comemic of Errors" and then "Cares" by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an inextricable attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parading on stage, and he wrote about him on New Faces.
His career on television began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time, I was the only black parody/comician on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I had to learn to be an efficient car to deliver jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrual Show, a light entertainment program in which people blackened their faces, Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "a lightly entertaining classic on British television for years and years" was also "a glittering parody on black people."
Representing and singing characters who have bothered black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the '80s.
The first season of "Lenny Henry" was aired in 1984, and in the '90s it was known as, among other things, Chief Gareth Blacklock of "Chef!"
Advertisements, documentaries, TV shows and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems like you're pulling your time or turning your back."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's the Good in...?"
The first one was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't be properly taught at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage downstairs.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't scold it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and he got caught.
I have a feeling I can do this.
It's like my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it up.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Commie of Errors."
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside of me said, "You're gonna have to work 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle it.
"You play the play, stay in the role."
Henry's at the fences at the Daches Theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the musculature.
She was well received, too, so it was like a sign from above, showing, "That's what you have to do."
He says it, of course, with a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has comedian thinking -- all the way through our conversation, his humor flashes, when he starts, he ends parody.
I just decided not to work in the stand, because this thing with the instant reward from the full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do it all the time, it could be a dead end.
I sometimes work for the Apollo Lives when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to have.
I'm asking if he'll ever give the tour of the stand-up again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So this is his new manifestation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya has begun the biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid in the form of a government application.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata has promised to reduce corruption in government structures since he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($70000) per month was lost through payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to flow to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, as reported by BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri of the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must report to the identification centres within the next two weeks in order to guarantee that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, and must be reported in a government application.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be erased from the payroll and reported.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - thus putting an end to the problem of "invisible workers," said Ann Waiguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers for Planning and Organization of Government.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with a "negotiation" against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the Government," reported by local news agencies.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Harriet Daily News.
Some of them participated last December in corruption detection activities, which were aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and bugging a telephone.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (who was then Prime Minister), defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic Cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer vacation.
This day has traditionally been a big event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yacenyuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
September 1st, the ceremony wasn't held in every school.
There is no peace above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for peaceful skies.
Alexan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slaviansk, where Yacenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally emerge here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study has traditionally been marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead's face, the BBC may have found such a powerful leader that she needs.
It is followed by a plume of glory from the banking world, the media department and the internal circles of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, when she resigned when a male colleague held a senior position in Pearson's lead company.
They say her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Her political ratings are also good.
She was recommended to David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector experts to Whitehall, who became a cabinet advisor.
Her husband is a former counselor for Tori.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's work a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also out as the voice of public concern and anxiety when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming in by dismantling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he were to deprive himself of his work in this process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be so hard, so many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size - after redefining its powers, finances, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, inevitable negotiations about the cost of a licence pose a particular threat to BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British are acquiring a share in the world's most definitely largest media enterprise.
BBC tells a good story: it states that its performance covers 96 percent of households and costs only 40p per day for each of them.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The models for viewing and using the BBC have changed: now I get the news headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missing programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found it.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
The tweet from the confirmed account of the governor of Texas, Republican Rick Perry, on Sunday evening contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats, who was in the centre of criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the tape was disavowed.
Just got a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it away," reports a later recording.
Perry's assistants did not respond immediately to the communications, asking for comments.
Although the records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing in that tape.
An earlier tweet contained an illustrious cartoon of Travis Rosemary Lemberg District Attorney who found himself guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a grand jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the permissible level of blood alcohol... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg wasn't investigating with a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His strong legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the Governor, who has been in charge for the longest time in Texas' history, was vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state's Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Veto had led to an official complaint by a group of people with left-wing views.
Perry's confirmed account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party convention in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, he responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a picture of himself running around the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market is back to normal.
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeastern England was back to normal activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of intense demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday, "From the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transactional levels since the peak of 2013," adding that it provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market succeeded during the recession, as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The city's prices jumped 18.5 per cent over the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, substantially exceeding the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" before the general elections next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons warned last week that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent loan conditions, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgages in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast of rising London real estate prices to 3 per cent for 2015, on the basis that real estate prices have begun to weaken.
Meanwhile, transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive parts of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital proved to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for the right product with the right design and best location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the sales for the term have been maintained."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost a third more than at the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
The annual pre-tax return rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, while income increased by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, prior to the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that Berkeley ' s expected revenues for the year would meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected all year before taxes of £450 million are paid.
Berkeley's stock value was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London Exchange.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence' naked are published online as a hacker.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual American Film Academy Award.
The photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar award, were posted online by a hacker who claims to have a catalog of photos of another 100 rising stars.
The star's spokesman for the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and convicted the hacker for "an insolent invasion of personal space."
Law enforcement has been approached, and they're gonna go after anyone who's gonna publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the photo exchange site of 4chan are believed to have been derived from the lack of an online storage system for Apple iCloud, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims includes the names of dozens of female banners, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are real, although the star Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone, Winsted, on Twitter, also condemned the break-in.
"The one who looks at the pictures that we took with my husband a few years ago when we were alone at home, "I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of Nickolodeon "iCarly" and Victoria Winner denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of my naked FALSIVKI, the people.
Let me stop it in the bud.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the pop star representative of Ariana Grande denied that the photos in which she was believed to be true.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that brought praise to critics
They were dissolved, the best way to say it was, they were slowly falling apart like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy in communication, tense, closed, and perhaps a little annoying.
And then she shakes his hand.
He saw annoyance in himself.
He was like a jerk, yeah.
The last victim of this barbarity was a little romance that he expected more than usual to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a trembling, fragile beauty with a broken hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a raw but like a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat still in the bathtubs, the slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden rose with weeds similar to the gigantic coops of cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both scary and charming, with a full secret garden.
The author's view is: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the Booker Prize Long List in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Aileen sat by their hands in broken shears among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpected warm spring day; they both dispersedly connected to a cheap console that gave the country peaceable music and soothing news, when, looking at its crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black artist who his father loved to listen to, leaving the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their aggressive nature, songs of this type were no longer lost on consoles.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually forbidden - they just didn't lose anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
Public tastes have done things that could never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among books people have chosen the memoirs of rich people raised in poverty, cooking books and love novels, they have chosen ballads from all music.
This afternoon, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing with a rude comic voice the big legs of Aileen.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he said to her, with two fingers automatically attached to her lips.
That's what his dad always did to stop the letter "J" before she blew off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it's gonna cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew it was coming from him, that's all.
He had to explain jazz.
Aileen never heard him.
Jazz wasn't playing either, although he wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability worked on people's nerves.
And jazz was witty, expressed with music.
Although he reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about the jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
Society was obedient, meaning that every segment of it accepted the principle of group predisposition - thanks to those who were saved by fate.
People of African Caribbean descent were well suited to entertainment and sports in terms of temperament and physical characteristics, and they sang and ran.
The Indians, as if by nature talented in everything about electronics, have made sure that no family is left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was doing sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was beating plates.
Citizens from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly, when what was going on, were afraid that they would be accused of blazing the flames, in fact, that the flames would swallow them up next, opened restaurants with labs and batons, did not stand up and bore themselves from idleness.
Everybody's capable.
Since she had heard only ballads before, it was difficult for Eileen to understand how the insulting words that Kevin had just sang to her could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevinn.
Except maybe for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but a neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves that looked like cabbage.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She flipped her head untrustably, closing Kevin's view.
In the whole world, there was nothing but her black hair ass.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying with her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Trying to make fun of him often led him to awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the calming charm that could mitigate the violence that had been racked in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too, Kevin.
In spite of the kind eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the shelng, overturning the console and the wine that they had been drinking.
The wine from the buffet, so the intoxication couldn't have been an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed trembling like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a dumb head," she said...
I don't like you, though.
He felt sorry for her both because of the excessive harshness of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was basically like this place.
The same huge ice ocean hit them both.
The same distraught men, even more sensitive and capricious after that, if their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers were any more powerful than their ancestors, wandered in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hands against any woman who dared to deny or mock them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First a kiss - the kiss is now the most common expression of the erotic annoyance between a man and a woman; the antidote against the fresh ballads that gave the console - first kiss it and then hit it.
That's a lot of clarity, in Kevern's opinion, because kissing was already a hooligan in itself.
Eileen Solomons showed with a body that he needed to leave.
He climbed up from the shearing like an old man.
She felt the lead weight herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window, she watched him leave, and her companion was a man who had himself suffered hardship.
She thought Adam was leaving the garden.
She felt compassion for him and men in general, even though some of them raised their hands on her.
The man who turned away from her, with her bent back, shamed, fought, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single incident until today when she saw it?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her legs.
Twenty years prior to or near the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, an informal public opinion monitoring service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop at all, taking into account the resources and forces devoted to its eradication.
"A lot has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the inherent aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow scattered areas where, despite church spires floating over the fences, the tender breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
Some qualities, however, appear to be inexorable.
The higher the spire, it seems, the lower the passions that it creates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of obstacles overcome and announces its passionate belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only old rudeness retains its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and vicious bias is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her science director, reading the entire report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitive, perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, like those you showed me.
Clearly, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "brown" would be interpreted as an expression of natural love and energy.
To continue to insist on what had happened if it had been used as if it had occurred, if at all, yesterday, was to deprive the country of its vitals.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was talking.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingos, the LED letters repeated the advice that "Ophnau" had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, value your husband, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, accept, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word song is better than a written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you're trying to say," Esme Nussbaum answered quietly when she was satisfied that her science director had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we didn't heal as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to something that happened if it wasn't.
Only this time will we throw our anger and mistrust at others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips in the pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" actions that our grandfathers have or have not committed.
You go too far and when you talk about them throwing away their "grain" and "untrust" on the "others."
In your place, a man should not need to be reminded that, while we understand the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" or "them."
There was no "us" and there was no "other."
It was a time of unrest, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with myself," she dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done was done.
It was then.
There's nothing more to say, we agree here.
And how you don't blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it's appropriate or if there's something you can fix.
But why the past, if not to learn --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one word to that--
Luther Rabinowitz's Pyramid fell apart.
"I'll consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, "in an angry rage."
Coincidences happen.
The army of Lesotho states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army denied preparations for a coup d ' état aimed at overthrowing the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country ' s army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in Maseru, the capital.
The Premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa, claiming that he had been threatened with an attempt on his life.
An army spokesman, Major Ntelle Ntoi, stated that there had not been a coup but that the army had responded to a threat from "political fanatics" whom the police had tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements among the police forces that were actually planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to create chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A representative of the South African government, Clayson Monjela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
"Though no one had claimed to have taken power by force, according to all the reports, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces had, to date, the main signs of a coup," he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea halfback Marco van Ginkel will spend the next season renting in Milan, reporting Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
In the last season, he only appeared on the field as part of the London Club three times.
Let's remind you that Milan had previously rented from Liverpool's assailant Fernando Torres.
Eurozone output at 13 months ' lowest
The growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest 13 months in August, according to popular research.
The final value of the eurozone production sector business index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 points to growth.
New orders were delayed, and enterprises were affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values came before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the eurozone's recovery, as well as the risk of inflation deflation, which is only 0.3%.
It is suggested that ECB leader Mario Draghi later this week may give additional signals that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Though any growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent," said Rob Dobson, the senior economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest bloc economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of concern, as does Italy ' s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Mr. Dobson said that the signs that the growth momentum had been lost mainly by the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, were also uncertain."
The slowdown in industry is likely to further fuel the fire to analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of the IHS Global Vision, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the eurozone's business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone's producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tension - particularly with Russia/Ukrainian - adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened tension obviously hit business - and especially consumers' confidence - and probably results in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like" the ECB would, of course, have to make some kind of quantitative easing, "though we suspect it will be limited."
The people of Mariupol will make a living chain against the militia.
In Mariupol, it was quiet until last week - no one tried to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, a city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the residents are horrifyingly waiting for the "militia" to arrive.
According to political scientists, separatists are breaking into Mariupol to reach the Azov Sea - the town of Novoazovsk, which had not previously been part of self-proclaimed republics, was recently taken.
The Mariupolians have decided that the Ukrainian army, while protecting them, has little force against the excellent armed representatives of the LPRN, and have come to help the military.
They dig trenches, they build roadblocks, they build reinforcements.
In the evening of Saturday, several thousand inhabitants came to the eastern border of the city, and found themselves in a living chain singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They're gonna do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and collect equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
The city is gradually shutting down shops, and banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible takeover of school, like the children in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the terrible seizure of a school in Beslan, in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children who were heroically survivors of the disaster, were warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like some sort of extreme evil.
The tragedy brought the east and the west together in a deviance, which in an amazing way then turned into action and hope for the future in the face of a terrible grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in the south of Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during the atrocities at school.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted the scourge, even though the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is currently afflicting Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back into the shooting gym.
It is captured in a photograph of a well-known Russian photographer, Dmitri Belyakov, when in one underwear she tried to climb back into a shelled sports hall after the mine exploded.
In confusion, Aida was desperate to find her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people as well as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too severe.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dr. Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, although the memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our misfortunes, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet of me climbing through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, find out about our tragedy and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at the age of 7) and survived three days of occupation, hugging their mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw the baby crying on the way, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking that her son was dead.
After they were reunited, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now non-existent News of the World), where he was awarded as Protector of Children from the Barnardo's Premier Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can tell you that my memory is getting dull.
I remember when I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer shooting games, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted and drive in an open-top car.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have endured.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel so bad for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who was volunteering at a women's monastery last week.
I really want to help.
I want to serve in the police force someday, and I hope to be enrolled in the academic academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember a terrible silence right after the capture, just no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted many months.
She clearly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, they can be supportive.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Cherie and just tell her it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat a borch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't been better in 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news story they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or evil at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not obsessed with this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
Didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, and Damira is now 17, he's taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
It's hard to believe I've been so sure for hours that he died and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got back on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell lying all over my body.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Dameer, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
A boy whose shocking post-absorbation photograph has become a defining factor for the tragedy in Beslan.
Rest: Survivor Beslan Georgi Ilyin with his mother Fatima after her capture in 2004, and to the right Georgiy today
His bloody face had a scare mark when he was fleeing death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54 years old, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember that tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Inspired into the soul: the photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember that Georgius so wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in our bookcase at home.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgius now says, "It's important that this never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens because if you ask people, no one wants war, because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need it to take decades to forget her a little bit.
She affected my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares about the capture, but now it's getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and my classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym in front of every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna study to be a cardio-surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be military, but my health wouldn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgius Farniev, 20
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Unbelievable: Georgius Farniev was at the feet of a killer terrorist during his capture, but he survived.
During the seizure, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
Really, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage to his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things, and I have to say that that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year, was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I fainted.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: George Farniev today, with a photo of himself on his laptop in the hospital after his capture
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something children should know about, and it's not something they should survive.
His mother Marina, 42 years old, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George isn't gonna do it.
To him, she should be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God he came back to me, there's a fingerprint on everyone in Beslan.
He's staying with us.
Georgius is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50% over this nightmare, but it's impossible to get over it completely.
This terrible experience stays with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We've been a friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them away, as far as you can.
Alena Tskaeva, 10
A baby who was taken to safety by a SWAT fighter.
Rescued: Alena Tskaev is taken to a safe place by a Russian Special Forces fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember the horrible crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was taken from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, her ten-year-old sister Christine and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alena's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little daughter, whom he named Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, has no memory of being captured and has flourished into a smart and happy girl, says the neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Singzi Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund, Borussia, said that he looked forward to being able to return to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in the career.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm playing for Borussia again, which brings out Bild's words to Kagawa.
I feel really good.
Full of positive emotions and looking forward to getting back on the field in the form of "Borussia."
Let's recall that Kagawa moved to the MoJ from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to join the English club in two seasons of only 38 games in the England Championship, scored 6 balls and handed over 8 assists.
The man is accused of attacking a girl at the pelican pedestrian crossing in Fayfe
A 78-year-old man will stand trial for assaulting a three-year-old girl at the pelican pedestrian crossing in Faifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenwin crossing in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart was driving his Audi Q3 without due diligence and attention and hit the girl, resulting in her being injured.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstrother, denied his guilt at Dundee's Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, Queen's Counsel, set the trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't cook in Vladivostok.
The duty-free trade shop Duty Free of Vladivostok Airport has posted a sign prohibiting purchases from the store by a number of world political leaders.
They can't cook spirits, vodka, and cognac.
The store administration has decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaly Klicko, Julia Timoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other prominent comrades will not be able to cook vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And put a sign on the door.
Obama had previously been banned from having an even less accessible facility, the Dietary canteens of the MGU, as announced by the catering site.
Whether the American president ever wanted to eat in Russia's diet cafeteria is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem awfully witty to themselves.
Whether there is cheese after the embargo: Bearev gave advice to the farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should learn new technologies in order to produce the cheese varieties needed from buyers.
The board was given during a visit to the company by the "Yugpticiper" of Agrocomplex.
The head of Government also gave the restaurant councils a shift towards Russian meat, which is of good quality.
The annual embargo on food imports was imposed in Russia on 7 August.
The main coach of the Russian team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted competition preparation.
Our athletes have performed at their own level, " says Maslakov's "All Sports."
Third place is confirmation of our high-level command.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
You have to bear in mind that we weren't preparing for these competitions.
The season is over, and we did not commit our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second in this tournament, but we've had a fresh start this season.
On the contrary, the French put together a capable team of 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was repeatedly publicly announced.
But even this kind of competition could not stand up to the Americans.
I believe, therefore, that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were about as low as the same Diamond League.
Season over.
Of course, athletes are no longer so important as a result, much less in command-level competitions.
The important thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it's absurd that men were so involved in tactical running tricks that they showed results below average... women's races.
4 clues on how to improve the quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or take videos underwater, you have a number of options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soapbox, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for around $300.
I took these pictures at the family holiday with a few cameras, all at a price of about $350.
Whatever equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof chamber, make sure that the cell battery and other compartments are locked.
In addition, set up your camera for the kind of photos or videos you're going to film.
Some photo and video cameras have camera or object modes that optimize the display for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cells are only 5 feet long, while others are 50 or 60 feet long.
Look at our buyer's manual and digital camera ratings for both conventional and watertight models.
Take off some personnel because many of them won't work.
The soaps have an LCD that will help you compile the images, whereas the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it's gonna be hard to see under the water, and it's gonna be random.
So do some personnel.
Also, if your camera has a serial camera mode that takes off a few frames with slightly different displays, use it.
Stay by the surface.
The amount of light drops significantly, the deeper you dive under water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you film in the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to display more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get closer to the shooters.
It's a great advice for grounding, but it's even more important underwater because of dark light conditions.
Especially important if you film an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you have to get close to the objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympics Bronze Championship Award for Bilal Mahov may be a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by the chief coach of Dagestan's free fight, Sajid Sajidov.
The expert did not exclude the participation of an athlete at the World Cup in Tashkent in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently at the "classical" team, citing "R-Sport" Sajid Sajidov's words.
In fact, the juniors of Bilal also performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he was the winner of the Volks tournament and third prize in the Greek-Roman competition, and decided to focus on the free fight.
It's been a long time since we talked about our new career as a heavyweight in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can perform at the Tashkent World Cup - if he wins the outfit.
But the decisive word is always behind the trainer's office headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose strength could shake things around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
The anesthesiologist who advises him has dedicated his career to freeing the sick from both the suffering of the disease and the suffering of the treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are interested in diagnosis and disease, those who are being treated are mostly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting symptoms similar to the flu, he discovered that he was annoyingly blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results are back.
It was mesothelioma, incurable cancer that affected the pleura, or the skin of the lungs.
It's hard for most cancers to figure out the exact reason.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma, it's different.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, fibre-fibre building material, which was once called "the miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s when the industrial advisory ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: typists, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it's hardly a cause for concern today.
But that calm is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
There are more people dying of mesothelioma here than any other country on the planet.
With an estimated 2,500 deaths per year, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that, although asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the attack on mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, laid in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, wealth, occupation or age.
The bastion of election, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, has proven to be no salvation.
The Parliament building is covered with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe locker.
In fact, he had to think where he might have been in contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It looks like there might have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy Hospital, where I spent six years in an internship," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors, and movers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
That was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who were interned at the Gaia hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am one of the survivors."
How many of us are gonna get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live this long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always mortal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are going to suffer from the same disease?"
According to a leading mesothelioma expert in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is about to kill itself, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't realize they're gonna die like this right now.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotheliomas have spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen was ill-advised in contact with asbestos.
She worked online for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working for M&S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I had no idea it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
As a matter of fact, asbestos is not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They were named by the word "asbestosform," which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tile, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler joints, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, yet it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that could lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are strong, albeit circumstantial, reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in the UK]."

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of mesotheliam, when there is no known exposure to work or home, is likely to be caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Most of the impact, he says, is due to the "normal use and impact of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even in the heart of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committee premises had been contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be driven by something as harmless as "strong air flows."
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Parliamentary Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean sanitation certificate," it now recognized that work should be done at £1 billion on the renovation of Parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that, after the general elections of 2015, members of Parliament might meet at the QE2 conference centre near Westminster ' s green benches.
Goddard's report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules."
It is impossible to know if this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of the people who never managed to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that was successfully facing asbestos suits," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation late tonight.
Suddenly I started to get feverish.
It started very fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from pleura, the skin around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it to the labs.
And yet his condition was left undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was in sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in the E.R. with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott ' s condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to the team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into the cavity between the cover of his chest and the cover of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in a week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott went into meetings with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation was quite common on pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now strikes younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-isolated pipes in hospitals were in the basements, so patients are unlikely to be injured.
But many of the staff who were walking through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to a toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for clients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
The students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos trays.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
The schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, school children placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos trays.
Websites have appeared to highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tile or rooftops of barns usually contained asbestos.
"It's industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful sleeping the garden sheds.
The effect of a diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes a lot of time to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient.
As an incalculable number of patients before him, he remembers being confused about the amount of information that had to be taken.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I've been given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we support life - the act of breathing itself - that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and fibers breathe, they can be stuck in a lumber, a covering of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irrigate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from the inhalation of the needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gay Hospital in 2001.
It's the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now ironically, leading the mesothelioma treatment center.
Tragier knew Lawson and treated some of the others who were probably exposed while interning in the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos enter the tissue of the lungs, says Treger, "they are pushed to the periphery where the shell is.
It's basically an invasive process from the beginning.
Normal treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is highly controversial.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Tragier doesn't agree.
"Can't cut the pleura," he says.
You can't stand around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very good for chemotherapy," which "acts" but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there are sick people who live a long time," says Tragier.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became sick with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single-person support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he was very happy when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "have planned to paint things a little more positively."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazdunsky, a professor of thoracal surgery at Guy Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admitted Graham.
The average patient would have to get direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is inescapably ineffective, many patients face yet another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when they talked about the bad faith of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement," according to Morgan, because Lawson couldn't prove conclusively that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos in Guy's hospital.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for the hospital in Gaia confirmed, however, that "the escape in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades after that - has proved to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed down.
Insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that on their side there is no time for plaintiffs.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been enacted to facilitate the recovery of compensation for mesothelioma patients, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who has no one to sue.
In such cases, patients would receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like many people who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is "very good work" for the insurance industry.
"It's a transaction written by insurers for insurers," he says, implying that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time period had not been involved, and the mesothelioma patients could have traced the companies and filed the suit in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "imperfect."
However, both Penning and Morgan recognize that, while seven people die every day, a quick action was needed.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunski can boast of 40 percent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt strong.
"That's one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some kind of force that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Further scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few stains [cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physical and emotional.
You can think of practical things - finance when I die, for example, or what you need to show your wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you're not happy.
We need to look ahead.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and a lot of people called us very quickly.
Ellie was more discreet.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, not even a glimmer of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as Stephen Jay Gould eventually) dark certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, "mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos.
Asbestos fibres are used to strengthen the pot and increase thermal resistance.
Pliny Senior describes asbestos.

The modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and tissues.
Large asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy, and Russia.
It's the perfect heat insulator for steam engines and industrial revolution turbines.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential statisticians detect premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and are consequently denied life insurance.

No compensation.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of exposure to asbestos, was developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for injury to health caused by exposure to asbestos in the United Kingdom.
Global asbestos production rises to more than 4213 000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The UK Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the United Kingdom.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production stands at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to avenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to trigger long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't betray our expectations, but it does make us angry," said Legislator Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously, we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular nomination of Hong Kong's leader for election would be too "haotic."
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to choose by vote the head of government from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kong people the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates strictly controlled from Beijing.
And under the new article, only candidates who " love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when one of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong took place over the years.
A large part of Hong Kong ' s pro-democratic campaign is dominated by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down Hong Kong ' s financial area unless Beijing guarantees real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers stated that their movement was moving towards a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the wave of protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online application, the organizers reported that the movement had "considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that could only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue had been exhausted and there was no other choice.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the capture of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong prepared for Beijing ' s statement for several days, and security measures involving police and barricades were strengthened at government headquarters on Sunday.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put business at risk, a source of Hong Kong's life force.
"The protest they're talking about can cause great economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long," said the legislator, Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want Hong Kong getting out of control.
It's a performance that's harmful to investment.
Chinese state-owned media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown by spoilers sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one fifth of Hong Kong's electorate.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The American prom culture goes to university life: freshmen were invited to come on a private plane
We are happy to respond to this demand by launching the first Lux Travel Service in the UK for current students.
The company also offers transport options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to give a good impression of its arrival at the university.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had thought about safety.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new options for the VIF, we look forward to helping students this year to reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company reported that since the service had just been launched, orders had not yet been received, but added that "students would start ordering the service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that while students must pay £9000 a year, they still hope to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes to do it.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being cut off from reality.
Megan Dunn, vice president of NSS for higher education, said, "This project seems incredibly cut off from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep up with the rapidly rising spending on basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking thousands of pounds out of a kind of simple arrival in a dormitory.
The feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson.
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
They raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, about the murder of an unarmed teenager, Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions increased in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Peres saw responses from white women, which were 100 per cent focused on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the 9 August murder, personal essays with headlines such as "Ferguson's thoughts on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're facing, and because (the Ferguson situation) is so race-based, they felt like they had to point it out.
For an English professor at Ohio University, Corita Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day but are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how coloured people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those problems; they faced difficult realities every day.
While white women now unite race and gender in feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"In between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always based on the rape of a white woman," told Hattery.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify lynching.
From Hattery's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white Sufragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the electoral struggle would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a basket of voting rights for women, and voting rights for blacks would appear later," told Hattery.
Looking back at these things gives us a clear idea of why coloured women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained their voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Association of South Women for the Prevention of lynchings.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists have had to catch up with problems that black women have been coping with in generations.
"Really, would it be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology took as seriously the right to raise a child as they do the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
A prominent white feminist activist, Gloria Steinham, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take more part in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public inquiries - will be at the forefront of change" - wrote Steinham.
Although Steinham vouch for more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
Researcher Christine Sommers of the American Business Institute, author of "Who Stealed Feminism?," said She The People that young men in the United States, especially coloured young people, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinham's remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "My Brother's Horse" to help vulnerable black and Spanish - speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinham.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that drives the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Guard arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-west border this year, immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the problem as important to women, she had only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [immigrant men], women who come with them find themselves in positions that are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonating with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich's pig house is for sale.
The photograph of the house placed for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be a big pig resting in the living room.
For £120000, a separate one-bedroom house is on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was marked by a photograph of the living room of a pig with a head lying on the couch.
Connells' real estate agency reported that the pig in the photo was a home-owner's pet.
"But the photograph was misplaced and already deleted," reported the company's representative.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique separate house with one bedroom."
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it is still in the promotional material.
The sale at home attracted interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth US Open match, who gave up Caroline Woznitzky, feels that she lacks stability.
According to an athlete, she wants to complete a year and try to get to a new level, passing on from New York to Vasily OSIPOV.
How are you gonna generally appreciate your results at Big Hat tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad I managed to win the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarter-finals.
What are your tasks until the end of the season?
After the injury, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make it worth the year.
The Asian tournament series starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the Committee of the State Duma on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former World Champion Nikolai Valuyev, suggested that the GTO standards should be met with bonuses when entering universities.
In general, he said, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times - people would pass the standards of pulling, running, and other exercises.
Let us recall that the 12 constituent entities of Russia will begin to implement the norms of the TEG on their territory on 1 September.
I also offered schoolgirls who gave up the GTOs to give bonuses when entering the university, " noted Valuev.
For example, you can add a little points to the EEG.
There are also proposals to provide additional exits for workers of enterprises who have undergone these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire emerged after winning the lottery.
Harvey's lottery player this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where a lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from a racing raffle on Saturday night.
Harvey's newspaper stand brings gold to the top of the prize for the second time in five years, with last wins of $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to declare himself.
Steve Forward, the owner of the shop, said that the winnings triggered a little town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret win.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the top prize last month, marking the end of a few successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of the five million in August, following a huge $7.5 million win by a couple from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for 20 years and reported that the winners have given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
Harvey's millionaire brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the Government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and the Deputy Director of the Ministry's Department, Oleg Plujnikov, told the Government at the round table held by the "Vedomas" at the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan was commissioned by the Government, one of the main objectives being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September and early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy of which is available to Vedomas) is for 2014-2017.
Criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport have to be developed and how to encourage the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs measures to support the electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concessional credit and concessional leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, promote localization and build a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, amendments are expected to be made to the regulations to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (parking, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to regional authorities during 2015 that they should also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport, in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016, to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of regional government performance indicators criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support for cleaner transport production and the development of chargeable infrastructure.
Russia's electric vehicle market is still emerging, with about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was reduced, so sales would amount to about 500 grand, predicting the chief executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But five-fold growth does not make electric cars any visible: in 2013, Russia sold 2.78 million light and light commercial cars, according to the European Business Association.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors are imported into Russia.
Renault is a company that focuses on corporate clients, says Renault's director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remiz.
Most other producers of electric transport have taken a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
Russian manufacturers have also developed electric vehicles - "," gas, "," but the output is tiny.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AutoVAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the cost of electric vehicles, and the director of AvtoWAZ for engineering, Sergei Amanov, will not be able to make a breakthrough in this segment without God's support...
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles, in addition to the expensive cars (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, are on average twice as expensive as domestic combustion engines) is hampered by the lack of a chargeable infrastructure (refuelling - units), and the CEO of Avtostata, Sergei Celikov, is sighing.
Owing to the cost and slow pace of lowering the cost of electric vehicles, the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of Avtorovu, Mikhail Povronsky, and agrees with him.
On the other hand, automobile manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, and the main thing is to give consumer confidence that "e-mobility" is real; this will be facilitated, inter alia, by the emergence of new charging stations, as highlighted by the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being carried out, for example, by the Rosetti State Company: several stations have been built in Moscow and about 80 more will soon be available.
Negotiations on the construction of a fuel network are also under way with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sophiin, the director of Rosseti's Department, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles with different brands.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company, does not have the right to sell electricity, but is able to do so with respect to charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers it the most effective measure to support the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia.
The zero rate will remain in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it, expanding the concession list, is being explored.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences does Pankov.
Russia's transport tax is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric vehicles - they now account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives are also needed for auto owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as they have already done in Moscow), confidence in Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along the designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A Piper PA-46 single-motor plane crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, passing on ITAR-TASS.
The survivors have been taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometres from the Denver airport runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In Donetsk region, they deal with the captured fighters of the Donbass battalion.
The cartels were surrounded by Ilowayk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was really like in southeastern Ukraine, they wouldn't go to war.
108 prisoners can be described as lucky.
The miners from Donbass remained alive after the meat machine they were caught in under Iloway.
Around the army of the Donetsk People ' s Republic, the militants spent several days in fact abandoned by their commanders and Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from headquarters that the "ring" was available on the alleged corridor, the convoy moved.
But just a few minutes later, shells and bullets were hanging from all sides.
"On the basis of the information given to me, we had a corridor, and we were allowed to leave," says the deputy battalion commander with the Lermonts.
And when we went down between Mopol and Chervonoselski, crossfire started with anti-tank guided missiles, with "blows," 30-millimeter grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three cars behind me, so there were only two cars left.
An officer with the Lermont call says that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, and many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by the people they came to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders have de facto deceived them and condemned them to death.
They say, "We have been betrayed."
Colonna, the entire battalion, to be destroyed.
In the Donbas battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, as Ukrainian news reported on atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east by "separatists."
Alexei's already seen a different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar attack, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't let out of Ilowaysk, said we were in the ring.
I've already made arrangements with the commander, I've already written a report on my departure.
We were taken to Ilowaysk from Zurahoovo's collection.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in a cat near Iloway.
Some survivors now recognize that if time could be reversed, they would never have joined the punitive battalion.
All of the captured militia were handed over to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
The region has established a headquarters to limit the prices of products
A headquarters has been established in Krasnoyarsk, which will, if necessary, limit the increase in the prices of products in the region ' s market.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the provincial Government, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural produce in the province.
Is Kiev going to recover $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company valued the damage caused by the bombing of the Lisichian NHP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We're assessing the damages at $140 million and we're going to negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the implementation of the upgraded Lisichan NPP was planned for 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no "earthed rebels," but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
Besides, there's been a loss of technological oil pumped into the pipes," he said.
We will recall that on 18 July, a storage tank was burned down and two warehouses were destroyed in connection with the firing of the Lisichan NPP.
The Lisichian NPP, the main refinery in Ukraine, was launched in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichian NPZ is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro 4 fuel as well as Euro 5 diesel lots.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichan NPZ were suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start repairing the plant.
One year later, Rosneft received the Lisichian NPP together with other Ukrainian assets of the TNCs-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Japan Sea.
South Korean media reports that this occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time by Chagando Province, which is located on the North Korean-China border.
As Interfax was told in the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the missile allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea after flying about 220 kilometres.
The ruble falls against the backdrop of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3 cops to 37.15 rubles, and the ruble fell to the buffet basket against the backdrop of geopolitical tension.
The ETS bid on the dollar started transactions at 37.11-37.2 rub/$1, an average of 37.16 rub/$1 in two minutes, which is 4 cops above the level of previous closure.
The euro was 48.79 rubles per euro, which is 3 cops above the level of previous closure.
The price of the ballet basket was 3.5 cops, and it was 42.395 rubles.
The United States dollar is traded at 23 cops above the official rate, the euro at 16 cops above the official course.
The Russian market continued its rapid decline on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He kept the ruble cheap and up-to-date the historical maximum to the dollar.
The investors are now playing a precipitous role in the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far it's more like an artificial tantrum blown through the media, especially the western ones.
There are few options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to slacken sharply against the ballet basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, unless we see a new negativity in the near future, Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines are going to sue Ideal Tour.
Orenburg Airlines filed Ideal Tour claims totalling 4.7 billion roubles.
These are two cases that will be held in October.
The cases will be dealt with by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first suit was filed on 14 August.
It's just over 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
It's 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union of the Tour Industry, judges were appointed in different cases.
In July, the media released 1.5 billion rubles of Ideal Tour debt to Orenburg Avilines.
The CEO of the airline, Victor Zukin, speaks of 1.6 billion rubles.
The CEO of "Aeroflot" Vitaly Saveleev calls an even larger sum - two billion rubles.
Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter's microblog service has changed the user registration process to involve new players more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned microblogs.
New Twitter users will now look at a large number of reckoned accounts at the time of registration, in order to form their own reading circle immediately.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests specified in the registration.
Twitter automatically sets up a subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take his own boxes off so he doesn't read people he's not interested in.
Whereas users of microblogs used to see only avatars of recommended users, Twitter now features a sample of a popular blogger's tweet to help make an impression of a person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration over the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on upgrading the service.
This activity is related primarily to the service's continuing attempts to achieve no-loss.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a decline in readership.
The company is now desperately in need of more loyal resources for consumers who, once they come in, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising.
The knowledge day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy.
On September 1st, meteorologists in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day.

In cloudy weather, it will rain, the wind of the east quarter will be quite weak - only 3 to 8 metres per second.
The vehicle disposal programme resumed on 1 September
Since 1 September, a vehicle recycling programme has been under way in Russia.
Until 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redeployment from other areas of support.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would range from 40,000 for a passenger car to 350,000 rubles per truck.
Previously, Russia had a similar vehicle disposal programme.
The main difference of the current project was explained by the Minister that it was now not only expected that the machines would be disposed of for a later discount, but also that if the vehicle had reached the age of six, it would be possible to buy a new one at a discount when the old one was given to a trade-in dealer, it would transfer to Interfax.
The previous federal recycling programme, which ran from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, spent more than 16 billion roubles.
As a result, passenger car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (plus 101.4 per cent in relation to 2009).
The Creator Coming Out Simulator will release a game of modern journalism
The game is known as Coming Out Simulator, and has decided to release a game of modern journalism.
He described his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but it was only now widely known.
The inspiration for the game came from the events in Ferguson, where there are now protests that began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how news coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The game hero, a civilian journalist, will need to take pictures of what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the public.
The hero can take pictures of things in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the cops look like heroes and the protesters look like gangsters, the police will treat him better and let him go where the ordinary man can't go.
If he's covering things differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will have to be dialed by a hero's Twitter, where new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The date of exit and the platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event could change depending on how the photograph of him was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but that he wanted to focus on events in the Gaza Strip rather than on protests in the United States.
After he started collecting material for the game, he realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering events in Ferguson, he decided to do the game on the basis of what had happened.
Nikki Keyes is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which describes events from Case's own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager tries to tell homophobic parents about his relationship.
The Geletei drags Ukraine into continuing the bloodshed.
In calling for the preparation of another "ten thousand" victims, Ukraine's Minister of Defence, Valery Geletay, has drawn the people to the continuation of the bloody confrontation, as stated in a report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletey, who stated that "the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists" had been completed" and that "the great national war" had begun, in which the losses would amount to "tens of thousands."
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page - a subject for the study of non-military specialists" - is stated in a report by Russian diplomats.
They have difficulty believing that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that, if resistance continues, they would use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that the "operation for the liberation of eastern Ukraine" had been completed.
Perez Hilton removed all intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been horrified.
The hackers hacked primitive passwords into the iCloud (data warehouse) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Really, not for long.
Let's recall that Jennifer Lawrence, the star's spokesman for the Hunger Games, has already reported the theft of photographs from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all the images that are "shouting" online are real.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the same name's tabloid website, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her workshop colleagues for publishing their candid images, writing by The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do that.
I wasn't contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the candid photographs of the stars have already spread through the network.

Tony Stewart's in an accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track is just over in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tyre broke in 172 laps, putting an end to his performance.
Stuart drove his shitty car to the garage and then left without talking to the reporters.
The leader of his team, Chad Johnston, said that 14 members of the team were upset, but now they're gonna focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond, and I hope we can do better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a clash with Kyle Bush, demanding repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a rather big hope of getting to the end," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded onto the tow truck, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a dirt race in northern New York state.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or next race in Richmond to take part in the stalking.
He returned to work during the investigation into the tragic incident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who went on the road to complain to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the investigation of the cause of the accident would continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision was made as to whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause when he was introduced to the race.
At the start of the 12th position, Stuart walked at the 1st 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching the 4th position.
Then on 122 laps after Restart, Bush's number.

Stuart went on, but fell back to 21st position.
Sobchac and Vitorgan have cigarettes with Zvanecki in Odessa.
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Witorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV host did not mind reporting to her Instagrams.
True, one photograph was very surprising and embarrassed by the couple's fans.
It's taken from Zvanecki.
"At Michael Mikhalych's breakfast, Zvanecki Maksim explains what an instagram is:") #dessa," signed Xenia Sobchak's photograph.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter, no...
The couple's fans thought Xusha was smoking too, and they convicted her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?, "The pot kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast" and "It seems to be breakfast, but only cigarettes on the table"). "Ksenia, do you smoke?," were worried about their favourite subscriptions to her blog.
Remind me, Sobchak recently boasted about what a delicious dinner Maxim Whitorgan made her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the cabin and your husband cooks dinner for you (first for a married life, but it's delicious. It's important that at the end of dinner you don't say the words of the anecdote, "to be like this every day now," "to be like this," "to show off" by her husband Xenia Sobchak."
You can see in the picture that Maxime is making something with diligence, and there's salts and a baked chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital, Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Wage increases are also on the list of claims to be discussed with the Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, officers protested symbolically against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison workers ' union met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (NPR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, the head of the Central Penal Correction Department, Rosen Zhelazkov, informed the BPR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join in the protest of the trade union of prison officials.
The Army controls the new Thai government.
General Prayat (right) appointed Druita Wongsuwan (left) as Minister of Defence
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayat Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet of Ministers, in which more than one third of the posts are held by retired or retired generals.
The army has received key positions: the Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayat Chan-Ocha was officially appointed Prime Minister following the official approval of the King of Thailand for the appointment of the Head of the Interim Military Government.
The 60-year-old military, who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup of 22 May, was the only candidate for the post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
The army had previously appointed members of Parliament.
According to Prauta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat ' s Government.
Officially, Chun-Ocha will be the temporary premiere, as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is attempting to consolidate its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
against the background of total paralysis of civilian power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army replaced Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Thaksin as Prime Minister.
They are both popular with the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has ensured their success in the elections on several occasions.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elite had joined the anti-government movement, which had virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said the mussel salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, and the waitress from Palm's new bracelet is getting a little bit of a laugh.
It has to be formally admitted that this is true, but mind and stomach remain intransigent.
After all, we've all known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "Midia" - we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to say in depth that the success of an institution depends on three factors: location, location, and again location.
There are places that aren't good, but even great, but some unlucky ones.
Anyway, when I sat down at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once the City Cafe (in honor of that very TV show), then the Odessa Mama, and the Bojole restaurant and the Beer Friendship.
Now it's beer again, but it's no longer nostalgic Soviet, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed on the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, and the rest of the space was not even hinted at sunlight.
But it's funny here, like in the children's room -- red, yellow and green walls, color-colored chairs, instead of windows -- the TVs where the Russian girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg aren't new anymore, so compare to something.
There are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company's positive waitress is funny to present the menu by saying that "Midia are full of large seeds," and it should be noted that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in terms of content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, for example, who's supposed to predict that a collonian prune loaf (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio cut in such a subtle way that parchment paper would appear to be incredibly thick compared to it.
It's only possible to feel any taste if you warm up half a plate.
The salad thing is even worse.
Classic Liegian (260) would be the best way to make it a crime against the Belgian people: an awful iceberg once cooked a long time ago, a boiled Kenyan beans, puffed bacon chips, and some marinated onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with a league salad like that!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If you could still close your eyes on the unseemly quarters of the tomato cherries or the overcooked champignons, why do the mussels look like they've been defrosted and boiled a few times in their lifetime!
I already know there are perfectly normal white mussels!
They're served in pots "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauce, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, didn't really fit.
There are vegetables, and there's no smell, and there's no wine, so there's no mystery.
But good for mid-died frites with mayonnaise.
Chicken watersake here is not a snack, thick to the point that, depending on the mood, you can decide on the first or second course in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was said that the rabbit was cooked in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the contrary, the situation was diametrically opposite: the rosemary was jamming everything.
The rabbit seemed to have been fed exclusively by rosemary bushes during his life, which had given meat such an extraordinary scent.
But the rabbit was attached to the leg with a wonderful - no, just a good pear in a caramelized crust.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet but also full - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be too watery and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who approached the table was very informally interested in the food impressions.
Then we should come again.
The dollar has risen to more than 37 rubles on the news of new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
A dollar of "tomorrow" by 10:29 msq grew by 26.9 kopecks, to 37.02 rouble, and the euro was raised by 30 kopecks, to 48.73 rouble, according to data from the Moscow Exchange.
The basket grew 28 cents to the previous closing level and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, in pairs with the euro and in pairs with the dollar.
The long - term forecast suggested this mark, " says Alpari's senior analyst Anna Bodrov.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the course in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumours of military incursions have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk about him being resistant to this kind of news was erased yesterday.
The week is projected to close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, and the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to rise: 5 to 10 per cent will be added to the current fall prices.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruit will soon run out, and there will be a vacuum as the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the 37 rubles mark, went through it and came back, there was no tantrum, " comments Open Broker's Chief of Market Analysis, Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The Ruble, he said, had been severely weakened after the end of the tax season, followed by news on Ukraine, and last week the CB stated that it was moving completely to a floating rate before the end of the year and was refusing any foreign exchange intervention.
If you look at the day's swing, it's no different than the previous one during this month, and it's the 37 rubles mark that scared everyone, - the analyst continues.
And so, there's nothing powerful about turnover.
Trouble times for the currency market were, I will recall, when there was an increased demand for currency at the end of January, as well as on the third of March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the rouble.
First of all, this increase in export earnings, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import prices, is said by Alexei Kozlov, UFS IC's chief analyst.
Negative developments include the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, trigger inflationary pressures and, as a result, lead to higher borrowing costs, which in turn hampers the development of the country ' s economy.
In terms of the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble has somewhat smoothed down the price of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the MBA index fell by 1.67% during Thursday's bidding, and the RTAs index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative reduction in indices is due to a decrease in the ruble by more than 1.5 per cent during the day.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and motivated by a massive desire to buy currency.
Practice has shown that emotions are gradually disappearing, and listed rubles are partially or completely restoring lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic abuse is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she spent many years thinking she'd die after having been misdiagnosed.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her adolescence thinking that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Marie-Tut's disease, a group of hereditary disorders that caused nerve damage outside her brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that the misdiagnosis is a frequent problem among people with SMTs, because so little is known about this state.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have a SMT that can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and tweaked toes.
The sick may feel numb or pain, and the state does not heal and progress, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's attack, a state for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and she'd die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said: "I knew as a child that I could not do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never skate or skateboard with the other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after a few surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten the feet, she looked in the medical file when her doctor left the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I snuck my nose where I didn't belong, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and felt the worst panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all of my abilities in that interval.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and had asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found with a SMT.
"When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I had a lucky ticket," she said.
The British MST charity announced a month of information on the MMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington Zone entrepreneurs increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week and a company in the Washington Zone is no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid a total of $27.6 billion to the state and local governments in fiscal 2013, 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business at the state and local levels increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after successive years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Center, the Tax Policy Unit.
More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 per cent, is from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue is from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, generates the lowest tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a return to the company's previous real estate value, researchers say that it raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states, such as California, New York and Texas, seem to account for a large share of these revenues, the same seems to be happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined paid $10 billion of state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of public and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely more than one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and District of Columbia pay about half of the state and local tax accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around D.C., belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center for State Taxation.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the re-establishment of the real estate market.
Business revenues also seem to be improving, according to these figures.
Companies in the region declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, most of it in the region.
Although trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs does not increase at the same rate in all three locations.
Growth in Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the 4.1 per cent average.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year revealed that in Virginia taxes are lower for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable tax climate for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, just as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continued to meet tax revenue targets in the following year, the law could raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurial taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure in which most small firms operate - in Columbia, Maryland and Virginia grew by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments rising by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The World Judo Championship has brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
By this measure, the Russians gave in only to the main favorite of the competition, Japan's team.
The Chelyabinsk tournament started on Monday, and the first day brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, who was ranked up to 60 kg.
However, in an equal final struggle against Baldbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was only one comment received by the Russians.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful day for Russia, with three medals won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions of up to 66 kg silver came to Mikhail Pulyaev and bronze to Kamal Khan Magomedov.
In the final battle, the Russian won the 2011 and 2013 World Championship, Masashi Ebinum.
Han Magomedov, who lost his countryman at the quarter-final stage, won the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In a women's tournament of up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzutina also reached the third stage of the pedestal.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the active World Champion of Maylinde Kelmendi of Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In a bronze dispute, Kuzutin won from Ma Inan of China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she hoped for.
Once again, Kelmendi, who had won Kuzutina before in the finals of the European Championship, was a barrier to Russian gold.
On the third day of the Chelyabinsk Bronze tournament, Musa Mousshkov, who fought in the category of 73 kg, was placed in the Russian team's pocket.
In the quarter-finals, he was offended by former Moldovan spokesman Victor Skowortsov, who now stands for the UAE team.
But then the Russian won two contractions and became the winner of the award.
Mighty made a home-run tournament with an injury to the tibiastop he's planning to heal soon, so he's gonna take a break in the competition.
As for ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at the tournament.
Interestingly, another member of his country who had acquired UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, with bronze, concluded his statement in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of FM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which Ivan Nifont won in the category of up to 81 kg.
He defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a comment from a rival in a difficult battle of small finals.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but Russians traditionally confined themselves to one bronze in a men's tournament of up to 90 kg.
It was owned by Kirill Questions, and Russia's team guaranteed the medal: its rival in the consolation final was Kirill Denisov's compatriot.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent of the Questionova was unable to come out of the tatami because of the injury.
The male bronze was won by the owners, and on the sixth day of the competition, Renate Saidov placed it in the team's pocket, which was in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation ending, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Moore.
This ended the individual part of the world's championship.
On the last day of the Chelyabinsk tournament, on Sunday, the championships of the world were played in the team competitions.
Both Russian teams - both men's and women's - were among the main candidates for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the fine gender were not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But Russian judoists have won the command silver.
In a decisive standoff, they gave up the main favorites of the competition, Japan's team, in a persistent struggle against the score of 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the clear victory of Khan Magomedov and the volley of Denis Yartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals in the heavier weight categories.
In the same scenario, the bronze match developed in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, driving 2-0, gave it to Japanese women 2-3.
Russia's president Vladimir Putin attended the Chelyabinsk team, who congratulated the men's silver team after the tournament.
"Second place is an honor, but what I'm saying is that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whose words quoted by RIA News.
To lose to the Japanese, to the judo parents, there's nothing wrong with it.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
Russia competed at the World Home Championship much better than it did a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
There were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galsten and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big masimalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a man in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, he's a potential Olympic winner.
Especially in sports such as judo, the tournament was summarized by the Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, whose words were quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan's team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
Joan Rivers' family is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival at the New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from her illness.
"Thanks for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in his statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday, following an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopic, according to sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy."
The response was extensive, including numerous Internet support from Donald Trump, Montell Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Everybody can be kings.
The debut album by Royal Blood is the new hope of a British rock that brought rock duets from clubs straight to stadiums.
The Royal Blood duet is on stage for only a year, but already has an active nomination for the BBC Music Award, a tour to warm up at Arctic Monkeys, and a visit to the New York concert dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album, the same name, received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is striking, since it is not the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet voice of the "new R'n'B," but the duet of the faggots playing with the volume and intensity levels that were last in fashion a few decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album were particularly high for all the above-mentioned circumstances and have already been fully met.
The duet took a name that could have been violated before, except for the desperate hairy metalists, and the blood of the kings that they think they have in their veins is also understandable.
This, of course, is primarily about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood seeks to shake the stagnating blood of the British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It may be a little early to predict the success of this enterprise, but something can be said.
The ten songs that were held in 30 minutes were not so much a show of phenomenal composership as a strong and powerful declaration of intent.
Of course, some of the advantages of the individual numbers cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out of the Black" is characterized by a drummer, not by a melodic line.
The musicians are jokingly saying that this song is easier to rattle than to hum.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth is, however, that each of these songs will sound great at a party of hard rock fans, but when they lose in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous painting.
And it doesn't have to be bad, even the other way around.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they don't claim to be new Lennon and McCartney's laurels (they're soon to be followed by Motörhead), but they've brought numerous rock duets out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite its diversity, is made for stadiums, in a room of fewer than a couple of thousand people, obviously close.
The secret is in part a bass trick, replacing the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the "The White Stripes."
But it's not just about the tools, it's about the way the songs are written.
The zero heroes were very hard to move beyond the post-modern paradigm, with great reluctance to admit themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and brazen that it successfully drapes some secondary and hardening music material.
So who said rock was supposed to be smart after all?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON has just confirmed what the Information reported on Friday morning: Online shop - and video producer, and a hundred other things - buys a Twitch streaming video service for $1.04 billion ($1.970 million).
The news turned out to be a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling a Twitch video service to Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and that combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general streaming service - a YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly became a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games" according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a genre of videos in which all-knowing people make (mostly old) game processing, as in the Mystery Theatre, is already popular on YouTube.
The thing is, YouTube is often mentioned when they describe Twitch, so the news is that YouTube buys Twitch was met without much interest, a classic example of an ingrained technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly as willing to pay as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the Executive Director of Twitch Emmet Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them more quickly."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching it, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking the joystick into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 in the morning when she crawls through Resident Evil, and it's quite another to watch some stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle on their own can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I'm gonna agree that speed passes, where the Rogers Bannisters of our e-century finish whole games in record time, are entertaining.
But if it's not about the virtualism of the game or the humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that a Twitch will turn into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just swallow a Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of the Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not show signs of death, even - ooh - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages - almost all the students now, the parents of the deceased, the cemeterykeeper - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the "Matery Beslan" Committee, Susana Dudieva, who participated in the special operation by an MES officer - says Elizabeth Antonov, a socialist working on a special project.
Already returning to Moscow, he met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who was Presidential Adviser for the North Caucasus 10 years ago and was negotiating with terrorists, as well as with Russian FSB Officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What really shocked me during my work on this topic is that in Beslan, it's like there's been no ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people have difficulty talking about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we did our job," said Antonov.
A special project has been prepared by Rambler & Co holding studio, which has been working for the company since spring this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin in power.
DPRK launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea, reporting by Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, on the North Korean-China border.
The missile allegedly fell into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and declared it to the Joint South Korean Chiefs of Staff Committee.
Members suggested that the entry into force of the Personal Data Act should be accelerated.
If the initiative succeeds, Russian data cannot be stored on servers abroad from 1 January 2015
A bill has been submitted to the State to postpone the date of entry into force of the Russian Personal Data Act, which has already been adopted, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the lower house ' s legislative framework.
It was sponsored by deputies of the State Duma, Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (Unior Russia), Vladimir Parachin (Just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective enforcement of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The Act, the entry into force of which parliamentarians are hastening, obliges Russians to keep their personal data on the Internet on Russian territory.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, store, clarify and extract the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located in Russian territory, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roscomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian legislation in the field of personal data by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offending websites, an automated information system called "Regist of violators of the rights of subjects of personal data."
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Dengin of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of RDPF.
Money and Yushchenko are also among the sponsors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have data centres in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill introduced today in Gosdum, the first vice-heads of the Dum's Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levine, stated that he saw no problem in moving the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that would not have their own Russian personal data storage facilities in the Russian Federation by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, for example, from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are willing to rent their servers and are already providing their servers, Mail Group, from Western companies that are already providing their servers."
"There are also several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to implement the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, there is no problem - they will have technological facilities for accommodation," Levin summarized.
Disputing Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association for Electronic Communications feared that, if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the draft law deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, making it imperative that their recording, systematization, etc. be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the record is being recorded by systematizing its personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible for it to choose the territory in which the action will be carried out.
Similarly, the adoption of similar bills to "localize" personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
The Ice Water Tester sprained her jaw
Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom screamed so much when ice water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This ice water bucket test has gone to a lot of pain.
The woman was hospitalized after screaming so much during a bucket test of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so furiously when ice water was poured on her head, which damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck," she said The Mirror.
Water pours on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts, seconds before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but it didn't close, it got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
That's when my mom and my sister got the same understanding, and they started laughing, but I had to be taken to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British woman was taken to a hospital to fix her jaw after having been involved in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an Internet message and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
More than 400 prisoners were handed over by the militia to the Ukrainian military
The Novorossia Army claims that the Ukrainian Su-27 was shot down and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
On 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by the spokesman for the Novorossia press service.
He added that "the Su-27 aircraft in the area of Mereška was shot down by air defence forces in violation of the ceasefire agreements."
According to the agency ' s interviewer, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions during the shelling of the Lugan airport.
The spokesman noted that the militia had been able to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The loss of the enemy's life - up to a hundred dead and wounded, 13 prisoners" - was summarized by a staff member.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, armed groups of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side, within the framework of the ceasefire, of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the Novorossia Army, "prescribed an attempt by the Nazgwardeans, in violation of previous agreements, to remove heavy equipment from the area."
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during the night were five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and injured
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by militia in the Ilowaysk area of Donetsk province.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leaders of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the environment.
In the DPD, they agreed to do so on the condition that the enemy surrenders weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began leaving the surrounding villages on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, 14 more people left the cat on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at 137 regiment 32 of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation" where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia have denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation: Russia will respond if the EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take counter-measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report from the Russian Foreign Diplomatic Department states that the European Council's "conclusions" of 30 August demonstrated the inability of the EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their headless support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, on the basis of "absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country" on the website of the agency.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the Euro-Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide the conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties," underlines the agency.
The Department ' s website also indicates that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has occurred, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
It will be recalled that specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
In doing so, EU representatives work closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced with each other for the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and oil and gas.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to graduate, has come up with a tricky way of cutting costs.
He developed a system for renting books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who goes to the College College Covenant in Georgia.
The necessary literature last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, an average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
The rental of books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and often costs significantly less than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookshops, reports that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books at university bookshops during the last spring semester were rented, says Vice President Trevor Meyer of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookshops, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores."
Here's an introduction to the best way to make a good deal.
Purchase from an Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see at the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler costs about $290 on the price list, but a new copy is available for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used goods
If you don't mind someone else's marks or injuries, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasadei, 25, a fourth-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-time copy of the book, Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business side of advertising.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of College Without Walls at Massachusetts University in Emherst, invite students to check with their professors whether previous publications should be used.
Sometimes renewals are not relevant to the class.
In such cases, old publications can often be found at a very small percentage of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to the purchase of used books.
Rental
It's worth thinking about renting textbooks if you treat them well enough, remember to get them back and don't want to keep them when the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you can get for notes, highlights, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember, if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are rented, acquiring an electronic licence for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The "Mathematical Analysis" rental on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Golt, 29, who is going to start his studies at Pepperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price of the book, as it ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering on the Internet, says Golt, make sure you actually have a book in the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn that lesson.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the Far East Development Fund to be totally ineffective.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called at a meeting on support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, established two years ago, was ineffective, according to Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the President emphasized.
During the meeting, the Head of State requested that the approval of the list of areas leading to development in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of the STORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, had never approved until 1 July the list of territories leading up to development in the Far East and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also set out the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s accessibility to transport and removing infrastructure restrictions, both on the domestic market and on export development.
Among other things, the President stressed the need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to create areas of excellence that should become competitive with key ATP business centres.
It is recalled that it has been previously reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the EEA.
Why galaxy guards couldn't save cash collection
Sylvester Stallone's Unsatisfied 3 has returned less than $30 million of their $90 million US budget, while "City of Sins: The Woman to Kill" has returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Home video with Cameron Diaz only brought $14.6 million on the first weekend, while children's films, such as "How to tame Dragon 2," are also disappointing.
The story of Robbie Collin's film critique suggests that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the worst year in history with regard to children's films and called "How to tame dragon 2" a barely operational fantasy extension.
However, when it comes to films directed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that was rented in the summer with at least 2,000 copies between the May and July 20th Memorial Day celebrations in 2013 and this year.
Results that take into account the views of both filmmakers and film critics suggest that this year's film harvest is similar in size to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be about changing visual habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services, such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-run Disney movie "The Book of the Jungle" said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must recognize that and not try to chase behind what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in Hollywood cash charges, Netflix's income from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and foretold Hollywood's "crack."
In the light of the current recession, some commentators argue that there was a share of truth in his grim predictions.
As several potential cash hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including "The Avengers: Eras Altron," "Minyon" and "Yur Park," other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer Simon Kinberg, Human X, recently called the drop of cash charges simply "cyclical," saying Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of institutions with Caucasus and Central Asian food, but Russian suppliers are a terrible dream for restaurants in Europe and Japan.
And in general, it is common for the time being to replace illegal imports of products from Latin America, Israel, and China, not Russia.
"Better has a small cucumber than a bad mozzarella," the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio breaks down about the quality of the cheeses that suppliers offer him in exchange for Italian.
Mozarella and burrat cheese ended first at the restaurant, they have a small shelf life.
Parmesan supplies should be enough for a couple more months.
What do I do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Dorogomilian market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes, which makes it clear that shocking memories keep him alive until now.
The meat was only 30 centimetres from the floor on the carts!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said we'd never buy anything in Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe it's different now.
But the other day, I had a fish sample from the Far East.
That's how it turned out to be rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many common things in Italy are for a Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It's got to hang out to be soft so the muscles can relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said it's yours, Russians!
Why doesn't anyone do that?
In five minutes of walking from Barlotti, a French restaurant called Brassery Bridge hangs a stop list in the kitchen, indicating missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef at the Brassery Most restaurant and the Stralka bar, Régis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss cheeses.
However, Régis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Cultural cabbage - 200 rubles!
I say, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money, too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy long-eastern oysters by weight, but they live for 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
At the price, it's superdelicacy.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of scary girls for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "For the first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibers and quality.
Many restaurants in Europe don't know what's gonna happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sanctions menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, generally referred to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, cows, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started chefarding with suppliers: food prices have risen, and there is an urgent need to look for analogies from other countries.
The greatest impact will be on expensive restaurants with monocupines in France, Italy, and Spain, to which products were supplied directly from "mother" countries.
The commons had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when Rosselhosnadzor banned the importation of Australian beef in early 2014 and American and Canadian meat a year earlier.
In return, suppliers arranged for the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 were far more severe.
However, on 20 August Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that remove from the ban the male Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be eased.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in an uncertain environment.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, imports accounted for up to 70 per cent of the premium.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant owner of RestConsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we don't have enough cooks like that, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the Brassery Bridge restaurant is ready for this: you have to give up 10-15% of the food, half the menu is reworked.
In restaurants with mixed kitchens, they're starting to replace dishes like marble beef steak with beef stroganks, says Sergei Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," listed by Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogies in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and semga from Norway - salmon, semga, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of European vegetables and fruits can be offset by the production of domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network restaurants would be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it was unlikely that the gourmets that could distinguish Italian mozarella from Russian would go there.
Although it's hard for Ginza Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and menus.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace him," says Mironov.
In Ginza, they refused to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
Café owners of Caucasus and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than Europeans.
But there are also many restaurants that will hardly be affected by sanctions.
These include institutions with food from the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There is no expensive food in the Georgian kitchen," says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and Cafe Wai Me!
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, and many meals are based on chicken fillet, exotic greens we don't use."
There's not a single dish on the menu in Kolbai yet.
Timura Lansky, owner of Chihon N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is not embarrassed either: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia were to import from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, we would even win the price, it would be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he said.
It is cheaper to get cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit from the CIS.
But what comes from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
Everybody knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Olymboy Artikov of Uzbekistan stated that he planned to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan indicated their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fast food restaurants that responded to the Money request are also quite calmly responding to sanctions.
McDonald's stated that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia supplier department, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise in the supply of vegetables and in the price of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, no more than 4% of "sanctioned products" were occupied at all.
The sanctions and the noodles of the Walker were not affected.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potato did not respond to the request for money, but other market participants argue that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East fish.
On his hunchback.
In the meantime, restaurants complain that even local prices are rising due to increased demand.
"Grabley's grocery prices have increased by an average of 10-15% for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio twice," says Restorator Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the meal will rise between 5 and 10 per cent, recognizing Kolbay.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have been worth 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the prices of pork, " complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director General of Stardogs.
Chicken ham cost 35%.
Waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
The Stardogs will soon have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, " says Cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in the income of the household during the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he acknowledges, but it is not clear how fast: while most restaurants have stored food for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the price swings.
But no one knows what's gonna happen in two months.
There are a dozen tents in the square in front of Moscow City, decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the stage, musicians play waltz.
It's a festival of regional products with a funny name called "There's Time."
"We've been planning a local food party for a long time, and it's just the sanctions, we're hurrying, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, Greek cook Anastas is preparing a macaroni salad and homemade candy, and the other day there was a master-class in making a borough with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, assured by the organizers.
In the tent, there is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salehard, vegetables from the sub-scotch Lenin's name, cheeses from Jay Claus, the rugged Italian.
"The salmon for restaurants can easily be replaced by other salmon fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of the fish shop, "My people."
We've got nerves, keta, kizucha, hunchbush, chavachu, king's salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions with no special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with a domestic one.
In the window of his tent are shrimp with a Magadan birk, cod, omoule, muxun, mussels from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin's sure it's high time to go fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 were more than 4 million tons, much of them going to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 were about 800,000 tons.
The "Your People" store has been working since 2012, selling fish through an Internet store, and before sanctions was imposed, served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things."
So far, Galkin has received requests from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made out of our fish, he's hot.
We've had a lot of trouble, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling a million rubles a month of sushi through an Internet store.
Our fish is a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilo.
To confirm in Galkin's tent, I'm getting a philadelphia with a keta.
Unlike rolls with semen, they have to chew longer, but the knowledge that this fish, ours, is a domestic source of strength.
There's even halibut and sea bass rolls on "Your People" shop website.
In sushi bars, it is true that there is a preference to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with far-eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers haven't offered us yet," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Yevesev.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could have taken up a vacant niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka Boris Akimova project, imports from China, Israel and Latin America can be replaced more quickly.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They're able to fast-forward illegal imports as opposed to our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit the major producers of other countries in the first place," says Akimov.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry received a more disturbing signal than food sanctions.
On the basis of mass exceptional inspections, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the substance of the claims to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors," stated "Dangam" at McDonald's Press Office.
No one really knows what's gonna happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, it is one option that can survive, says an anonymous employee of a restaurant consulting company.
If you start closing McDonald's across the country, it's gonna be a whole different scenario.
"Europrotocol" instead of a HYDD reference
Casco payments can be made without a HIDDD certificate - so the CB intends to encourage the introduction of "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidelines according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to obtain payment for the casco without reference to HYDD.
It is true that this is only the case where the accident was "Europrotocol" without the involvement of the traffic police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the limit and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
Since 2 August, the Europrotocol limit has been 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad provinces, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in a situation where Europrotocol can be used as a vehicle, drivers who have been involved in an accident cause DSVs.
Because if there was a casco policy, no reimbursement could be made for it without reference to GHDD.
The parameters described in the draft directive are precisely intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for cascos in cases of accidents not performed by HYDD staff should not be lower than the limit for "Europrotocol."
However, it cannot be above the limit defined in the Casco Insurance Contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DFS staff and roads.
But most likely neither the motorists nor the insurers will be thrilled with her.
The latter are already pointing to the serious threat of increased fraud that may result from the introduction of new rules for the payment of cascoes.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome Russia's traditional conservatism.
The driver will most of the time wait for the inspector to file a minor accident because it's more reliable.
It is not yet clear what would be easier to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the Europrotocol.
A savings certificate will make it nameless and irrevocable.
Minfin wants to ban the safety certificates for the bearer, but lets the banks make them the equivalent of an irrevocably valuable contribution.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit bearer certificates of savings.
This instrument has been gaining popularity lately, as the stakes here are higher than those on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer certificates are not included in the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank because there is no need to contribute to the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASIA) fund.
The picanticity of the situation is that the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates are planning to take this step and will affect Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to AFS, control 98 per cent of the market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow is estimated to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained to the ASA, is that the customers of a small bank that bought such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the ASA if the licence is revoked.
Some investors may assume that their investments are insured if they do not have sufficient financial literacy and buy bearer certificates for savings.
The justified absence of insurance payments under these certificates, if the bank ' s licence is revoked, may lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the agency's practice, there have been cases in which bearers have tried to recover insurance through the courts," stated ASW.
The problem, of course, is imaginary.
Indeed, there will be no payment of certificates to buyers because they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
If it were that the instrument was not insured with the ASA, it would also prohibit metal accounts on which citizens ' funds are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts, too, do not enter the deposit insurance system, but no one has yet attempted to do so.
It is likely that bearer certificates are very convenient securities that can actually act as quasi-denegors.
Their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank's client can buy a certificate, hand it over to any citizen, and before cashing it can be replaced by multiple owners.
It is not by accident that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must be the identity of the security that must be kept in depositaries.
And in order to sweeten the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early payment.
That is to say, an analogy is being introduced for the unrevocable contribution that the bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyport and Cardiff
The weekend saw protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered outside Cardiff's town hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclau followed the events for us during the weekend and spoke to protesters from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the terrorist group Islamic State, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS, referring to the decision taken at the conclusion of the meeting of representatives of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It is reported that Germany will send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will take place before the end of September.
In addition, a decision has been made to allocate an additional 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Mrs. Merkel will make a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk militia shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August to ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the towns of Broadino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports that two coast guard boats have been fired.
It's made clear that the incident occurred today about 4:20 ms.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two boys were taken by helicopter to safety after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went on a camping trip shortly after noon on Sunday to Govets Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m. when they didn't return home.
A search team was sent, comprising local police and rescue troops, and a couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Vail Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hurt her head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up at the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition.
Two alliances met.
The summit talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they had been convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first European Union faces met with the first persons of the future Eurasia.
Even if there is a disturbing situation (the situation around Ukraine does not delay), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed for the first time a number of "hot problems."
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this matter were dropped on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians followed by other Eurasians and Europeans saw President Lukashenka in the television news.
The Belarusian leader gave an example of a sharpened courtesy, it was the behaviour of a man who had just ripped off a jackpot - and planned a dignified old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenka helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenka and allowed him to speak at the closing briefing on their behalf is not merely a 20-year-old legitimization of the President.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Senior Analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same way as before.
"The fact that Katherine Ashton met Lucashenko's aunt suggests that the EU's relationship will continue to defrost," he said, "fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for the breakthrough long before Maydan's November in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, modernization dialogues - listed the "Fire" interviewer - and international security talks were held with the US.
The States even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only encouraged the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus to negotiate.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure rejected Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militia in Donbass, did not fight with Moscow.
Minsk has neither left the Customs Union nor the CSTO, while the Russian airbase is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, and the Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful Lukashenka's movement towards political diversification will be will be seen by how often Minsk will soon be able to receive meetings in the EU+TC format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosiančič merely stated to "Fire" that, given the issues of war and peace, this issue was not a priority.
At the same time, it has been reported that Kazakhstan may be the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in the new format.
The slipper for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked to do so by the representatives of the European Union.
However, in his closing briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all the parties were not opposed to Minsk being the central venue for meetings, both in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that "the last dictator of Europe" is gaining the status of a hands-on European leader who helps to solve a global problem.
Best Friend of the European Farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the Euro-Counsellors on Trade and Energy, led to the conclusion that the main thrust of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting's schedule of future negotiations on the supply of gas and on overcoming the concerns of the TC countries under the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be more ambitious than the achievement of peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Commissioner for Trade, Carl De Gücht, nevertheless pointed out that the EU representatives "have come to Minsk to find a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not vice versa."
However, the economic crisis in Ukraine seems to be working for Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the reciprocal sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing the sanctions pressure itself, a long-awaited space for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Mizes Research Centre, ex-Candidate for President of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus ' capacity to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumventing sanctions.
There are also supply chains for which Vladimir Putin at the summit stole Minsk.
"Initiators of these schemes," underlined Romanchuk "Fire," were not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have worked long on supply chains, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
The Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, continued by the expert, is that many Ukrainian companies do not mind producing Ukrainian raw materials in Belarus, also focusing on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very useful."
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenka and for the development of economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow ' s sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, while the European Commission currently offered only Euro125 million in compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian president can invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Eurofermers.
This could raise Lukashenka's credibility in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for their summit initiative.
But the paradox is that official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TC+EC format, is being rejected, and the Belarusian leader, in a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague, stressed that Kiev was the pioneer of the new format.
"It was your proposal to come together, to discuss without any amount, not from the bay barn, to make a decision, after signing the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that had been prevailing in Ukraine at the time," he turned to the cameras before Peter Poroshenko.
The observers, however, interpreted this as an attempt to calm down Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially opposed to Minsk's mediation, which greatly increased its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic service, it is hard to stress that Belarus does not have a selfish purpose in organizing EU and TC interaction on its land, but the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space in the future, from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that, in other spheres, in particular in the field of security, the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Fire" at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, a department where words have recently been carefully picked up.
There may be areas in Moscow with a fee-paying entry
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing toll-free entry zones as a method of controlling congestion along the lines of other major cities around the world, transferring M24.ru with reference to the Moscow Deputy Transport Officer Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proved successful is fee-paying entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, see all the negatives and the pros.
To say that some decisions have been made on this matter yet early," Lixut told us.
Zammara stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which were similar in structure and workload to Moscow, was very important to the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries was the construction of the central ring road already under way, and Lixut was added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that all traffic does not have to pass through Moscow.
If there was enough bypass infrastructure, you didn't need to have transit traffic in Moscow," noted the deputy.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of toll-paying parking had substantially unloaded the streets of the capital.
And according to him, the authorities in the capital do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the ceremony for the construction of the first Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD) launch complex.
Boring is sinful.
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, "City of Sins 2: A woman worth killing for," did not carry out the revolution he could have expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with a minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the core of modern thinking "thesis, the antithesis, the synthesis" (as defined by the nuara theorem of the universe, and the antithesis by comic book space).
It should now read "thesis, antithesis, chaos."
"The City of Sins 2" is chaotic at both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yeah, some of the heroes are familiar from the first city, although, here's the big man Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended up in an electric chair, and here, nothing, just getting caught, as a popular friend, out of the air, with knives and other axes with sticks.
But the old people are literally pushing the new guys with their elbows, like they're breaking into town from some other movie, about the meaning and story that the audience is asked not to worry about.
So, his story, shamelessly ripped off by the authors in the most interesting place, is with super-star players Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His own is the witty-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something revenged on her by Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion in which Dwight, let's say, doesn't distinguish her face from Johnny - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are blown to characters with inexorable regularity - is not a problem, nor is it even a half-breath.
They're not people, we know they're archetypes of noire: a rock bitch, too confident a player who's reached the honey trap of sex with a detective, a corrupt eavesdrop-sentator.
Well, when the archetype waltzs with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's not a movie, it's not a movie, it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
The fighting whores from the first city still hold round the air against the dark forces that are besieging their native slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost isn't, and he's gonna look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with "City of Sins 2" is the other one.
Frank Miller was good because as a painter, he was able to combine the comic book and the noir, and as a director, he turned the picture of how to move the comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "realities."
==Early life==The modern form of comics was born in the late 1920s, when novels by Dashil Hammet "Blood harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created a noire canon, then called hard-boiled school - the "cool school."
Or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood dozens of heroes: from the Pope's sailor, the spinate eater, giving him wealthier power, Superman, Batman, and Skipper Dick Tracy to Hulk, Torah, Spider-Man, and other "revengers."
But there was something bad about any movie because of the comics: the characters that were painted were obstinately reluctant to grow up with the screen flesh, remained pretenders in the world surrounding them, the will-involved "real" world.
To put it simply, they were completely deprived of "existentiality."
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre in world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, character, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsythes, what Tibo and Rugon McCars, what even the Bolkons and Rostovs are thinking after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated into soap opera format, and criminal - that is, by definition marginal - the novel was raised to the level of a philosophical prose.
Hammet found out on his skin what it was like to work as a paramedic on the front.
He was a communist.
As by the way, they were at least close to the compartment and the pillars of the genre, such as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directed by Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawzy, Edward Dmitrick.
So the noir, whose archetype they set, was, first, rude and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was not natural, but it was organically connected the comic book to the noir.
For the first time on the screen, he lived a comic without being embarrassed by his graphic nature, not pretending to be a real movie.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered for the monstrous sadist son, was worthy of Hammet's feather.
And painting parts like the cut-off heads that the sadist decorated his nest, the feather of the genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseous - representative of the Neonuar.
"The City of Sins 2" isn't a retreat, it's a surrender of Miller-Rodrigues' radical style to the comic tradition.
Probably a lot of this happened because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins," you feel like a prisoner in a glass ball, inside which snow falls to the toy clown.
Most of the time, it's not snow, it's blood scams, but basically, what does it matter?
Well, there's nothing to say about socialism.
It's only possible when somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, we sometimes have, on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can take back a crooked girl, or say, unsatisfied parents, that her spoiler is punished.
But when there is no sin in the city except sin, then sin is no more than sin.
Boring, like any norm.
Chaos "Cities of Sins 2" is boring.
For the sake of justice, a domestic rent gave this fresh sin a small but pepper.
The writers warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In the very vegetarian episode, the toes of which are broken, it gives you a hell of a laugh.
Hammet would love it.
The French socialists have to "shut up and get France in order," says Frasois Holland's key ally.
Mr. Valle called on the deeply divided left to "demonstrate the heat" to the attacked socialist President, whose changes were not approved by the vast majority of French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured him that his Government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite conflicting proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels by coming to a meeting of dissenting members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lost faith in the future."
Marin Le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the persistent internal conflicts among the socialists, saying that she had no idea that the new Wall Government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to assemble a new government when the past did not last.
"The new one won't last the fall or the winter either," told the reporters, Mrs. Le Pen.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
The French ruling party survived the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front was the first to vote in the EU elections in May.
A survey of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believed that the Socialist Party risked splitting up into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Cyance Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something's changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without drugs" was left without a lawsuit.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim of the Regional Directorate of State Property Management against the Drug Free City Foundation.
The office intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of Sverdlovsk Region dismissed the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Region (MOGISO) against the Drug Free City Foundation (a founding member of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Royzman).
The provincial authorities intended to recover 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent for the building.
It has now become known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, which led to the refusal of the hearing.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the Directorate of MOGISO could not be explained, and the head of the legal department, Maxim Titov, did not respond to the telephone calls.
The Foundation was also unable to reach out to representatives.
We will recall that this is a mansion that has occupied a foundation in the middle of the city on Belinski Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
This decision was made by the ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed an action with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the eviction of the foundation from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded that the uncontested contract of free use be recognized as the residence of the memorial mansion.
In the view of the MOGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, and an appeal was filed with the 17th Permi Arbitration Court, which was granted.
The Foundation then filed an appeal in cassation against the decision, which was rejected, and the decision was appealed by the Foundation to the High Court of Arbitration, but the Court took the side of the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease was concluded under which the foundation began to pay rent again, as was reported by the head of the city of Evgeny Roysman.
The rent was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous county administration has donated this building to us, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a token of respect for the fund.
The present administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why Mayor Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, the deputy of Ekaterinburg unicross Alexander Kosyntsev invited the mayor of the city, the Speaker of the pride of Evgeny Roysman, to resign.
The case involved a criminal case involving a person arrested on suspicion of murdering a retired deputy of pride Oleg Kinev, who was considered to be a partner of the mayor.
How did Eugenia Roysmana find a criminal case?
On 1 July, it was reported that criminal proceedings had been instituted on the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Eugenia Roysman, on the basis of the fact of "gloriousness" (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code).
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sverdlovsk province, where Anna Filatov, the Director-General of the Legal Centre for Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Roysman accused her of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband in his blog.
The mayor of Ekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will be turned into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present his new design, there are more leaks in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
The U.S. media reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple project with the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code's specialized Internet resource, Apple can also announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express at the launch of the new products on 9 September, making iPhone 6's mobile wallet function available in the new smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this.
This function allows payment to be made at the store counter by smartphone.
The payment identification will be performed by the user using Touch ID.
It is reported that for the first time the NFC (near field communication) technology will be built into iPhone, allowing for the non-contact payment using a smartphone and an appropriate cashier ' s reader.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high technology company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced as early as 2004 through the collaboration of Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and over a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote the technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with the NFC function Samsung Nexus S was released in 2010.
In May 2011, Google released Google Wallet, which allows users to tie bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
American experts stress, however, that despite the large investments made by high-tech companies in NFC technology, American rhythmists are still cautious about innovation and are not too eager to spend money on the equipment of their shops with such systems.
Therefore, now the observers hope that Apple's entry into the market will make the routers speed up and intensify the introduction of this technology at their outlets.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France: Paris's position on the supply of "Mistrals" to Russia remains unchanged
The spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris's position on Russia's delivery of the Mistral type helicopter carrier was unchanged.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in his 20 August interview with Le Monde: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of Europeans, not France," quoted by Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy department replied to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris ' position on the implementation of the contract.
For more information on the supply of choppers to Russia, see Ogonek magazine "Mistral" almost ours.
Ukrainian National Security Council: seven military personnel were killed in the area of the force operation during the past 24 hours
The representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 25 injured in the fighting zone in the east of the country over the past 24 hours.
The situation under Iloway is extremely difficult.
Until the withdrawal operation is completed, the details will not be disclosed.
At the end of the operation, the loss and cause of the situation will be disclosed.
Those responsible for such a situation will be held responsible," added Mr. Lysenko, refusing to discuss in more detail the situation under Ilowaysk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of SNBO, "every effort is being made to return prisoners of war," reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from Lugansk airport towards the settlement of Georgievka.
For more information on the situation in eastern Ukraine, read Arsen Avakov: the first Ukrainian military left the area under Iloway.
Norwegian Cruise approaching $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiating the acquisition of a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Lux-class cruise ships and secured clients Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, sources on Sunday warned that negotiations could still fail.
Prestige Cruises, a private investment company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources have asked to remain unnamed because negotiations are not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 per cent higher than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, works under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in subsequent years.
Companies are competing to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered with the U.S. regulatory authorities for the first public distribution of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after $850 million in 2007.
The Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists in 2000 as a result of a merger with the cruise operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment conglomerate and casino controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
==History==Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting had a share of 28%, Apollo had a share of 20%, and a private investment company, TPG Capital LP, had a share of 8% in the company, according to reports at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise travel in North America, according to registration documents for the first public listing of Prestige Cruises.
The Crimean Television Company can receive 250 million roubles of grants
In the Ministry of Communications, Russia proposes to allocate 250 million roubles to Crimea in 2014.
According to the draft Ministry of Communications Regulation, which is located on a single information portal on the preparation of regulations, the subsidies are intended "to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea."
The money will also go to the purchase of equipment, roof repair and power systems in a television and radio company founded in 1959, reporting to RIA News.
Activists of the Hong Kong Democratic Movement are disrupting the Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision was taken.
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress established a procedure whereby only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of Hong Kong ' s leader in 2017.
All candidates should first receive the support of the majority of the nomination committee, which would probably be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot paper and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to renew their promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of the Beijing Document describing China ' s control of Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city ' s business centre and held a sit-in.
Briefing by Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Jeang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the Feng Wei Council of State were also to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activists announced that they would meet outside Hong Kong's head of government's building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intended to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to annex 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
According to BBC, the decision to add land to South Wifleigh is linked to the desire to pay back for the abduction and killing of three Israeli youths last June.
Israel ' s Defence Minister announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to administer the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saiba Arikata, the world must hold Israel accountable for "the continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem."
Putin demands that Kiev start negotiations on the "state" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "State" of the separated region.
His press secretary, Dmitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to suggest that East Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed in order to enable the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels, as equals, was in line with the obvious strategy he had followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get close to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which had been seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories of Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians began campaigning for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government forces were attacking peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions - the "plenary of illusions" - reported ITAR-TASS.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were in the context of greater autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin's press secretary to correct Putin's "misinterpretation" of the words underlined the decision of the Russian leadership to behave against the separatist rebellion in the east in a way other than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants were not Russians, and pre-conflict surveys showed widespread support for staying inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact by handing over to the Kremlin de facto control of territory that would connect Russia's main territory to Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, weigh constitutional amendments to give the separated regions greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to agree with separatist leaders, as equals, followed a new rebel offensive last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the formerly peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in an offensive about which Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to Crimea itself.
This led to extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen the Mariupol, a steel port with 5,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko addressed the European Union Leaders' Assembly in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that was independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warning Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for the drafting of more severe sanctions against Russia to be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 military personnel had entered the Donetsk region last week to support troubled separatists, Colonel Andry Lysenko, Press Secretary of the Council for National Security and Defence of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
The naked photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged by the fact that a series of candid photographs showing naked Jennifer Lawrence have been online as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 candid photographs of the star Lawrence and Superstar of the Hunger Games, including the Kate Upton and Kara Deleuvin models, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strakhowski, who lives in Melbourne Greco, are also believed to have stolen photographs as a result of a leak from iCloud.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs should remain private.
It's awful that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "simplistic" and that those targeted " felt invaded."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by the naked chest pool.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of "Chuck" Strakhowski and the actress from "Forbidden Reception" Browning didn't comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Representative Lawrence said to TMZ: "This is an insolent invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his anger at the hacker by tweeting: "Picking up photos stolen from a mobile phone is in fact no different from selling stolen goods."
It's just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate publishing stolen photos.
Potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities detected
The mass hacking of star accounts may have been done through vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario described the resource The Next Web.
The Github resource published a script in Python, which allowed the passwords to be picked up by Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
It uses the same logic and password as Apple ID to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed for over-recognizing the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all kinds of character combinations, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script writer argued that in Find My Phone, the number of passwords entered is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and the user informed of the attempted hack.
Because of vulnerability, users did not receive any reports of attempts to access their account password.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, vulnerability was detected two days ago, Saturday, and a scripting program was written for it to select passwords.
At present, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
Resource contacted Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT
The Prime Minister's Twitter feed is again showing off.
Although there is no firm evidence that vulnerability has been used in Find My Phone to steal photos, there has been a wave of harmful actions using this service before.
The hackers intercepted the device and demanded ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple stated to the media that the safety of the cloud had not been compromised, but had not investigated how users had lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev, was also previously hacked into his Twitter account.
If the intruders had access to the iCloud described above, the password to the head of government account in the microbloging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to get Apple's comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-thousands.
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a famous Ukrainian athlete, Anna Buryak.
The decree is published on the online legal information portal.
Earlier this year, an athlete moved to Russia as a permanent resident and asked the Federation of the Modern Five to be given the opportunity to compete for the Russian team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in her personal championship, and became the World Championship in the mixed relay race, which is one of the new types of sport.
She's holding the lead this season as well.
According to the rules, she will need special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian sportswoman to change her nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian chess passport to Ekaterina Lagno, a native of Lvova, who is the two-time European Championship (2005, 2008), the world of blush (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, she won the chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the world team championship in Astana (2013), and the European team championship in Warsaw (2013).
SCR stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian investigative committee (SCR) dismissed the criminal case of the crash of the Tu-204 airline Red Wings.
This is reported by the agency's press office.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the aircraft engineer.
Forensics showed that the accident was caused by higher speed of landing, the crew ' s failure to comply with standard landing procedures, as well as the unintended release of the engines to the higher speed of direct propulsion.
The Tu-204 flight of Red Wings on the Prague-Moscow flight crashed on 29 December 2012 at the Moscow airport of Vnukovo.
The aircraft rolled over the runway and caught fire.
The aircraft commander, the co-pilot and the flight engineer were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where they subsequently died of their injuries.
Three other flight attendants who were hospitalized with serious injuries received long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of a vehicle travelling on the Kiev highway was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board.
The transport prosecutor's office conducted a post-disaster check at Red Wings, which revealed numerous irregularities.
In February 2013, the airline licence was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelyanenko began training at SIZO
The famous Russian mixed-style fighter, Alexander Yemelyanenko, 33 years old, who is in SIZO on charges of sexual assault against a domestic worker, has fully recovered from the injuries and has begun training.
The Championate reports it.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Yemelyanenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and detained in Tambowa on 9 May following a car accident that resulted in a fracture of his thigh.
Yemelyanenko, Jr., was placed in detention until 31 August and a sentence was imposed on 1 September.
However, the trial had been postponed and the investigation had insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If proved guilty, he would face a prison sentence of up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Yemelyanenko's career.
Emelyanenko held his last fight in January this year, losing his technical knockout to a compatriot, Dmitri Snovski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Yemelyanenko.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion.
An angry expression is biologically universal to mankind, and each organ and group of muscles involved in its creation is not an accident, but an additional means of expressing power and threats, has been identified by Australian and U.S. scientists.
They reported on their findings in Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, which can be briefly read in a press release at the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the swollen and lowered eyebrows drawn into the thin line of the lips, the bloated nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and it is made by even blind children who have never seen it, notes the leading author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have learned that this emotion has emerged for the effective management of disputes during conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he conveys it to the other by means of anger.
Researchers have also found other hypotheses: physically powerful people are more likely to be angry and to engage in handicraft, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions that are not favourable to others, and prefer violent methods of conflict resolution to be peaceful.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining," scientists have decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles creating an angry face should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer - thus forcing him to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modeled a person on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry face was present or absent and showed them to informants.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin did not individually make the face angry, the more powerful physical participants in the study recognized the human face with such characteristics.
Man's anger, like that of animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated display of his own power, forcing him to accept and submit.
A man inflates nostrils and squeezes his lips for the same purpose as a frog who inflates, or a baboon who shows his fangs.
"The anger is "launched" by the interviewer's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that shows the opposite party the consequences of the refusal as effectively as possible.
But the most striking - that none of the components of the anger face is arbitrary, all of them express the same thing" - noted Anthropologist John Tuby.
The Ministry of Communications has offered 250 million rubles to Crimea.
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization Teleradio Company Crimea.
This is stated in a draft government decree prepared by the department that Lenta.ru has read.
According to the explanatory note to the project, federal subsidies will be "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment."
In particular, it is intended to upgrade the hardware and studio unit, the video wall, the central hardware and the video server for the money allocated.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic link (VOLS) and the repair of the power system.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget allocated to the Ministry of Communications.
The State Broadcasting Company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, over 75 per cent of the peninsula has been covered by television and radio.
In 2011, Crimean Teleradio Company was granted a digital television broadcasting licence.
