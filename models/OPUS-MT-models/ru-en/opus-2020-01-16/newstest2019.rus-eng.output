Number of new recruits from Ukraine in preparation for deployment to Donbass
Andrei Marochko, a spokesman for the self-proclaimed Luganese People ' s Republic (LNP), stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans to "think to restaff the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the armed forces of Ukraine, the massive dismissals have resulted in low staffing of units," Marochko quoted by RIA Novosti.
Nor did he rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainian recruits could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Force (UP) operation.
This measure was expected to increase the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DPR, Alexander Zaharchenko.
The authorities in the DPD described what had happened as a terrorist act.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that Ukrainian intelligence services had organized the sabotage.
U.S. authorities forced Mask to leave Tesla's presidency.
U.S. businessman Ilon Musk will resign as chairman of the board of directors of the company Tesla, which he founded, at the request of the U.S. authorities.
In order to settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Mask to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
In doing so, he is required to pay $20 million and to leave the post of chairman of the Board of Directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed.
It is specified that the agreement has yet to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Mask of misleading shareholders of claiming that sufficient funds were available to buy the stock of the company and had sued the entrepreneur.
It's about publishing a businessman on Twitter, where he said he wanted to buy Tesla's stock at $420 per thing, but he never did.
After Twitter, the company grew by almost 11%.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison.
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of being a prisoner of the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to believing in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union has not let anyone leave it.
History's lesson is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not diminish, but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," the Minister said.
He also added that trying to punish Britain's decision to withdraw from the EU would only exacerbate the crisis, noting Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May announced that the Brexit negotiations had reached a dead end.
In this way, she commented on the outcome of the EU's informal summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 by referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.
Two dogs were given to the President of South Korea, who received mushrooms from the DPRK.
South Korean President Moon Jae In received two puppies from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after his visit to Pyongyang.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the administration of the South Korean President.
"During the summit, a couple of dogs were offered a gift from the prunsan.
They were received on Thursday, " reported the agency.
About a year or so, the North Korean side gave several kilograms of food to the dogs "as help for their adaptation."
A gift was given in honour of the inter-Korean summit held in Pyongyang from 18 to 20 September.
The hunting breed of Phongsan from North Korean wolves was named by a district of the DPRK.
According to the agency, Moon likes animals, he already has two dogs that were given to him by North Korea's past leader, Kim Jong Il.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also handed over two tons of delicacy mushrooms to his colleague Matsutake.
He ordered the fungi to be distributed to members of separated Korean war families who had not yet been reunited with their loved ones from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai village council stopped the hunger strike to protect the interests of the inhabitants.
The deputy announced on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation had reached an impasse, that the district administration was not responding to his demands and that he needed to carry out his work.
In addition, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has begun to verify the situation, and the heat company STPK has promised to begin work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the village of Siberia next week.
The villagers also formed and removed a mass collective appeal "relating to the current catastrophic situation" to the Governor of the Altai province.
Boronin himself reported that he felt okay, and that he had fully fulfilled his responsibilities as head of the hunger strike.
According to Boronin, the Sibir and Rógulnyk villages have centralized heating systems, which means that the authorities of the Pervomaya district have the authority to prepare them for winter.
To date, however, no one has begun to do so.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the Government of the Altai region and against the financial policy of Gazprommeezregiongas Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the villages for the winter, Boronin demanded "the immediate establishment of a full and independent section of the municipality with appropriate state units."
These are Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments.
In the first half of 2018, about 3,000 housing units were purchased in Moscow ' s new buildings, covering an area of 30 square metres and worth up to 4 million roubles.
More than half of these transactions were made on two LCs, as shown by the materials from the Urbanus portal (available at the Lenta.ru).
The budget for housing sales of up to 4 million rubles was led by the ICA "Nebrasovka," located behind ICAD, in the Kotelnik region (UWAO) and the Barbaris apartment complex in the Bibyrevo area (SWAO).
Two ZKs in New Moscow - South Bunino and Maple Alleys - were also visible in the structure of the transactions with the budget housing.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of housing transactions up to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 per cent of all sales and provides half of total revenue.
"The influence of apartments with a budget of less than four million rubles on the commercial success of the "Central" neighbourhood in the "New Vatutinks" and the ZK "Philatov Lug" should be recognized," says a study of another two New Moscow LKs.
They account for about 35 per cent of the financial revenue.
Previously, Bon Ton's real estate agency had the lowest-cost apartments in Moscow.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand rubles per metre) were recorded in September 2018 in UWAO.
The second and third ranks were WAO and SWAO, with 184.1 and 192,800 rubles, respectively.

Telegram users complained about a malfunction in the new version
Users of the iPhone complained about problems with the work of Telegram's messenger after the update of September 28.
The user's phone number can be accessed by using his username
The complaints relate to gadgets with an up-to-date operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, once updated, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Messenger representatives responded to the malfunction.
According to them, the problem could be related to migration of information into a new application written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until the malfunctions were corrected.
On 13 April, the Tagana Court of Moscow granted Roskomnadzor's suit for blocking the Messenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the communications operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was the failure of the Messinger administration to provide the FSB with the key to deciphering the correspondence needed to obtain terrorist data.
In August, Telegram changed the policy of confidentiality and agreed to disclose the IP address and cell phone number of the terrorist suspect's user on the basis of a court decision.
Telegram has decreased by 1.2 million since the freeze in the Russian Federation.

Ilon Mask is forced to resign as head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Elon Musk settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the television channel, as part of the agreements reached, Mask would have to resign as head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
At the same time, the commission allowed Mask to retain the position of leader of Tesla.
According to Tesla's founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be recovered from Tesla.
The money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is one of the 50 richest people on the planet in Forbes magazine.
He is the director of the SpaceX Space Corporation, the neurotechnological company Neuralink and the Tesla electric car developer, as well as co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla's CEO, Ilona Mask, for his Twitter account of the company's possible ransom.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all stock at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 stock was established "due to the importance of this number in marijuana culture," previously reported by Bloomberg with reference to the co-director of the security department of the Stephen Pakin Commission.
However, Ilon Musk subsequently refused his plans to buy back the stock.
Commenting on the lawsuit brought against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the allegations of fraud to be unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and sad about these claims.
"Honeliness is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not in any way violate it," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective claim against Mask alleging financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that they suffered losses as a businessman.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the businessman ' s tweetes had been misleading, forcing Tesla shareholders to purchase paper at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilona Mask's careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in course.
In September, Ilona Maska accused the head of the research company Citron Research.
In the meantime, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be in danger of being suspended from the company's management and even jail.
The former chairman of the Commission, Harvey Pitt, stated this, inter alia, to CNBC.
The mask is "a good guy who doesn't know how to run a car company."

According to him, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage," renaming the church is like in fascist Germany "the Jews to wear a yellow six-point star."
"It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," said the representative of the RPC on Russian Television 24.
Mitropolit also stressed that the UCP is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian, because "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country."

We must forgive our auto-producers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible at this time.

I know there are car sports fans in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team, he said.
"We stand ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like this.
I suspect that the thought of creating a team has also arisen because sochi has this kind of infrastructure."

It's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the utilization of the Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian autosport lovers were Daniel Kwiat's return to the Toro Rosso.
Together, we congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, " said Vice Prime Minister Izvestam.
He's a promising racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton.

His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he was ranked 18th in the Russian Grand Prix.
Let's hope our main pilots are bigger next season than this year, " said Dimitri Kozak.

The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of an era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming world glory and made him a Nobel Laureate.
By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.

In almost the same way, he was found penicillin.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most outstanding individuals in human history.

When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris papers wrote: "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotics saved the lives of more than 200 million people.

Trump told me about "in love" at Kim Jong-un.
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea were almost in love with each other, joking Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a good joke about his success on the North Korean crisis front.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now resolved the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, as the American President pointed out.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump pointed out that Barack Obama's team had such a relationship with the DPRK that it could not even reach the country's leadership - it simply did not pick up the phone.
At that time, the US and the DPRK were on the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "sweet letters" to the White House, noting Trump.
Trump admitted that, at the beginning of his work, he was also "hard" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, their relationship has now improved to the point where leaders " fell in love with each other."
Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetent.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang, as well as the closure of military test sites.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke very flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the Korean peninsula was completely denuclearized.

A positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of United States soldiers.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still buzzing.
The media reported that, following the Singapore summit, the US had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangsters."

Nice called for the replacement of the "Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
A Ukrainian child writer and advocate for the purity of Laris Nice's mother tongue called for the removal of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language" from Ukraine.
To do so, she proposes a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure."
Nice shared her views on "the desirability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of "The Reviewer."
She said that the Ukrainian product in question was being prepared - it was already in existence and was continuing to develop further.
In time, the Ukrainians would "relieve" from this "Moscow language," she was convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian language had previously been widely used on television and radio, but that it was virtually non-existent in public space.
However, in the view of Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the authorities' actions to prohibit the use of Russian are, in their view, only "extension of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Nice had previously shared her experience in maintaining the Ukrainian-speaking regime at a child's camp in Carpathians, where she had been invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons bookstores network, one of which she spoke to in Russian.
Nice threw a change into the girl without getting hers.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia," urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of names.
Nice recently stated that the name "Rusya" had been stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service was unable to escape the anger of the writer: when she arrived there and heard the staff talking to each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left by slamming the door.
We had a men's conversation during the break, and it came to bear fruit.

"You missed a few matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If you've been 90 minutes, then it's okay!
Actually, it felt good.
Maybe at the end, there's a little bit of power to make sure nothing happens.
So, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashniev led me to this game, for which they are grateful!
"What do you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning, it's easier to recover, and the mood in the community is good.
Now we've got a white stripe, though it was black at first.
We need to keep this up and cheer the fans up."
"Did you miss the game when you didn't go out on the field?"
"There's this, a little bored, 'cause it's really a nasty situation.
But again, thank you to the physical therapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and cheered up the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

In a referendum in Macedonia, violations were recorded
Four incidents involving violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on the intergovernmental renaming treaty with Greece.
This was reported on Sunday by the Press Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of the polling stations, there had been four incidents that had been resolved, he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelovski Elementary School in Skopje, 22-year-old K.J. broke public order and calm, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was arrested and taken to the police station.
According to a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all perpetrators were immediately taken to police stations.
The Ministry noted that all violations were being verified.
"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to abide by the law and to refrain from any violation of public order and tranquillity and from any violation of the secrecy of the ballot," said the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are asked in the Sunday referendum to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
On 17 June, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic during a solemn ceremony on the banks of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia."
The treaty should not only resolve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.
Head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Russia ' s decision to deliver C-300 - timely step
Russia ' s decision to transfer the C-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Syria is a timely step.
This view was expressed by Walid Muallem, head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with RT on Sunday.
If we analyse the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that it is a sign of security and stability, not war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful to Russia for its efforts in this regard," the Minister said.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that the C-300 was a defensive system, not an offensive one, and was designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashian hopes to hold early elections to the Armenian Parliament in 2018.
The Armenian Parliament may be elected as early as 2018, as the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikola Pashinian, said.
"Perhaps until the end of the year," the Head of Government replied to a question from journalists about the timing of the meeting (interfax cited).
Nor did Mr. Pashinian rule out that he would "take people back to the streets" for extraordinary elections if the debate with parliamentary forces failed.
But I am committed to negotiating with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they too are committed to constructive dialogue," quote the Premier of News Armenia.
Nicole Pashinian added that the early elections were "the demand of the people," as well as part of the Government's programme, which Parliament had voted in favour of.
The long-term vision of the Government, he said, was also necessary for attracting investment and economic development.
At the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinian promised, upon his return to Yerevan, to begin "negotiate with all parliamentary as well as extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the timing and conditions of the early elections."
In the current Parliament, about half of the deputies are from the Armenian Republican Party (RPA) to the opposition Mr. Pashinian.
Early voting was not possible without the dissolution of Parliament, and there was no legal basis for that.

The prosecution for the Dagestan MP became news.
The Soviet District Court of Makhachkala detained for two months a member of the People ' s Assembly, Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov, who was suspected of participating in a criminal association that had processed a disability for bribes.
The "J" became aware of the details of the investigation, which shed light on exactly how, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the Republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov, had contributed to the criminal actions of the former head of the General Bureau of Medical and Social Assessment, Magomed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of operational and search activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Rajab Abdulatipov was found to have been lobbying for the appointment of Magomed Mahachev as head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles.
We recall that the previous investigation against Magomed Mahachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial bureau of medical and social expertise under his authority, involved criminal proceedings under article 210 (establishment of and participation in a criminal association using official position), article 290 (receipt of bribes by an organized group), article 292 (serving fraud) and article 159 (specially large fraud) of the Criminal Code.
According to the investigation, in late 2013 Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Magomed Mahachev and his accomplices in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining the criminal association.
As the head of the Department of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation for Dagestan and having links with State authorities and law enforcement bodies, and also having a relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, investigators consider that "the investigation has ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community and has established contacts with officials of State bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal financial institution, the Central Office for Medical and Social Analysis in the Republic of Dagestan, has organized the illegal establishment of disabled persons."
On Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm facing today as a charge, it's all new to me, I don't know it at all," he said.
The court arrested a deputy from "One Russia" not for ten days before being charged, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months as his case contained article 210 of the Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much more time for the investigation to be charged, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, Russia ' s theme was virtually absent in a negative way
The head of the committee of the Federation's Council for International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not exclude that it could be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost been accustomed in recent years to Russia has now been in order more muffled," said the Senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, while, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was among those, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries that spoke with sufficient unanimity."
At the 73rd session, he stressed that "the Russian theme was virtually absent."
"If I carefully consider the speech of the President of the United States of America, the President of France, the statement of the Foreign Minister of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least the choir was not quite accurate," noted the politician, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall to be trained in tennis balls."
The head of the Sovfed thematic committee does not rule out that this reflects a trend which, in his view, "will single out the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully evident in a year, in two, three."
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be a turning point," Kosashev said, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia's involvement has been able to move forward in international affairs."
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as an example.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that Russia's vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time," added the parliamentarian.
This is because he believes that there is "an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time."
"I wouldn't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we're going somewhere where we're going to go where we're not going to be moving backwards, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "the demand for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I have attended very many meetings of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], and I have seen with great pleasure that if one year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, was largely not interested, the situation is different now," said the Chairman of the Sovfeed Committee.
In his view, this is because "the so-called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, a lack of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration."
"And here, the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," expressed Kosachev's confidence, stressing that in this sense "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, which is successful for Russia."
The orphan finished last on the Russian Grand Prix "Formula 1"
That's a great result for Max.
Considering he started from 19th position!
That's my birthday.
The Dutchman's upset, though.
And we congratulate Hamilton.
His separation from Fettel has increased by 50 points.
Bottas looks away with anger, I guess.
In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that no military force will be required in the Syrian province of Idlib, as stated by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
He said that Syria was entitled to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of the Russian-ban organization Jebhat al-Nusr from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of Euphrart if the Kurds were to seek separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with Kurdish SDF forces were good until the US ended.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Recep Erdoğan, agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led Chelsea's youth team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old lawyer was negotiating a transition to the Moscow Spartacus.
According to RT with reference to Mirror, former captain of England's team, John Terry, led the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has been a long-time member of the London Club will lead the team at least 23 years of age.
It is reported that Terry will replace Jody Morris at Derby County at the coach's headquarters.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to crossing into Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
The First Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the Russian convicted prisoner for "spionage" by Ukrainian journalist Roman Soushchenko for his failure to release him from the castle.
She stated this in a video message to a political prisoner on the eve of the second anniversary of Suschenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, where the participants declared a hungry protest demanding the release of the Kremlin's prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, artists and people who know you well are starving, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interviews where the President of Ukraine, Ukrainian power, all of us did not demand pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the liberation of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those who are being held illegally in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea" - said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that every Ukrainian would be tested by making us "evil, tougher in the defence of Ukraine's national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding of what is good and what is evil."
Let us recall that Ucrinform correspondent in France, Roman Soushchenko, was arrested by Russian silviculturalists on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying on the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Soushchenko to 12 years in a strict-regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared the verdict lawful.
The Russian prisoners granted the Ukrainian ' s last request before proceeding to the colony.
NASA reported that an asteroid the size of Big Ben was approaching Earth.
NASA, an American space agency, reported that a large SP1 asteroid was approaching Earth with a length of 160 m.
According to Daily Express, the space object can exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or the London wheel of vision.
However, the exact size is not yet known.
The speed with which SP1 moves is about 60,000 km/h. The least distance between the asteroid and the Earth will be October 3.
Then it will pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid was first noticed on September 19th.
NASA listed him as near-Earth objects.
Earlier, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first-ever video from the surface of the asteroid Ryuga.
Two Japanese rovers (planetarys) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe were able to extract unique images.
The football lawn was attributed to Baste by FM-2018.
The damage to the football lawn at Rostov-na-Don stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
Photo published in Instagram Account hd7tv.

Rostov Arena is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
The tournament was held in five games.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon."
Wahtang Kikabiza on cancer control
Many artists now talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, the disease does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wahtang Kikabidze confessed to being alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"It's like I was hit down the skull with a hammer.
I fell.
Lost his orientation.
They put him in the hospital.
Couldn't hold a spoon, couldn't stand, fell all the time.
Started testing, turns out it's bad, the artery's bleeding.
They brought me to Moscow, and they said I had a big pussy cyst in my head, so I had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst, " told Kikabidze in "Once."
The tumor was malignant.
At that time, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol at the threshold of his home.
But the actor's wife wouldn't allow a living actor to be buried, she believed in being able to cope with the illness, and she wouldn't walk away from her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was there like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, and he now lives happily in his home in the centre of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumors of his illness, of his premature death, which has come to light online, have been refuted.
The creators of the Peacemaker site included Peter Siyarteau, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, under the section "Purpose."
The occasion was "an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
In addition, the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighbouring country was found to be "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine," as well as participating "in the organization of provocation aimed at massive violation of Ukrainian law by Ukrainian citizens."
Note that in front of Siyarto, the governor of Kiev-Pechera Lovera, Paul, and the predecessor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow patriarts), Onufriy, were pleased.
Their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian Realm Church was a reason for them.
Previously, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, demanded respect for Ukraine ' s sovereign rights.
The authorities named the sum of the gold parachute of the Voronezhian sub-governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region, Yuri Agibalova, was made under the regional law "On public offices."
However, the real value of the gold parachute released from office was several times lower than that of the media.
Such explanations were provided by the Regional Government Press Service.
According to the law, the salary of the position held by Aguibalova is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, the press stressed that the lump sum was 223,892 rubles, less income tax, rather than 1 million rubles, on which the media had written.
The official received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
He has served in public office for more than nine years.
His pension and lump-sum payment are made immediately after his dismissal from office, and he was explained to RIA News in the provincial government.
However, Agibalov ' s pension supplement was suspended when he was appointed to public office and his salary remained unchanged from the previous period.
The governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, who won the governor's election, took office on 15 September.
Agibalova was dismissed on the expiry of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Negram Canal Nezigar published documents indicating that Agibalova, who had resigned as Vice-Governor, had paid a termination indemnity of 23 salaries, and that two days later he had been re-recruited with a similar position without a "trio."
The deputy of the State Duma called for school students to be told of the harm caused by masturbation.
He is the first Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
On the basis of his experience, he noted in an interview that adolescents were being masturbated by harmful information they found on the Internet.
This is being dealt with at the level of educational institutions and the family, and the deputy has been added.
Gennadius Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio Moscow:
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the harm because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective; it is that the maturation of children is early enough, and there are large scissors between their sexual maturity and the possibility of formal contact between sexes.
According to Onishchenko, the problem is being solved by "piousness," silence about "sex problems" and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are facing onanism.
The Deputy believes that the primary place for teaching lessons about the harm of nanism is in schools in "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we just won't be understood, to say the least," the professor said.
Gennadius Onishchenko is an active REMN academic, member of the Bureau of the REM, doctor of medicine and professor.
A well-deserved doctor from Russia and Kyrgyzstan, a member of the Bureau of the Russian-wide public organization, the League for the Health of the Nation.

The AdG was the second most popular in Germany.
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany hits another popularity record, and Angels Merkel's ratings fall.
Germans seem to have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest social surveys show that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zeehoffer are weakening.
This week, AdG broke another record by reaching number two on popular sympathy ratings.
Right-wing conservatives with 17% popularity have managed to bypass social Democrats, who have about 16%.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but one cannot fail to note the fact that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of Euroskeptic economists has become a major political force.
For the time being, leadership in the overall set-off continues to be maintained by the governing bloc of the CCS/CDS, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, Angela Merkel's support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German Government for a fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, 7 percent less than last year.
Add that social Democrats were followed by green (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative Party for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the alternative choice group 2013, which included Christian Democratic Unions.
The group initially became a government opposition, but initially only dealt with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's "subsidization" of weak EU economies, and did not exclude the possibility of a return to the German brand and the full withdrawal of the country from the EU.
In the context of the deepening immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the Euroskeptic niche and began to strongly criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternatives for Germany get seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens a "Nation of Fools" was published
Producing political talk shows on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostop Drozdov, admitted on live television that he considered his compatriots to be a "native of morons."
They believe TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov pointed out, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee of the Unsavory has begun to combat literature that has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities by banning the importation of 201 editions.

Canadians built a car in case of apocalypse - the magazine behind the wheel
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that they were already accepting applications for their new armoured vehicle.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armoured Vehicle
On the subject of apocalypse, money is made not only by producers of video games, film studios and book publishers.
Now the new niche is being developed by automobile companies.
For example, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions introduced its armored apocalypse Senator APC.
In a fantasy-free time, the company's engineers are building armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed to accommodate 12 passengers who are not particularly comfortable but who are safely housed in an entire armoured armoured vehicle.
This bunker, otherwise you don't name the structure, because its reservation level is in line with the B7 standard and is mounted on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armoured, can protect the capsule from grenade and anti-personnel mine explosions.
Apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC armored salon
In order not to damage passengers even an explosive wave from a projectile that exploded near the vehicle, the car salon is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
The Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a circular viewer system with a night vision function, as well as an armoured observation tower on the roof.
There's no weapon in the car.
Apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC front lounge
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong turbo-diesel engine of 6.7 litres, the full power of which is transferred to the four wheels of the armoured vehicle through a 6-stage automatic transmission.
There's no chance of getting stuck at the armored apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC.
The Roshel Senator APC's armored apocalypse will be available at a specialized exhibition in Washington in October.
It's called the time of the universe's death.
The universe lasts for about 140 billion years, ten times the age of the world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
A study of an international group of scientists is posted in the library of arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, published by the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The experts came to these conclusions by observing, with the help of the HSC (Hyper Superme-Cam) camera, the Subaru telescope over about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the energy mass of the world under observation, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model of the Cold Dark Matter, assessed the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Subaru Observatory noted that observations had provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of the European Space Telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the RIDCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments to the effect that the world under observation would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
Another attempt to bring together the founders of the pension referendum failed.
The opportunity to learn people ' s views on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A general federal initiative group meeting against raising pensionable age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that recorded different language of the questions (a total of five were registered by the Centre).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favour of not raising the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension as of 1 July 2018?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologod subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but which was regarded as the simplest and most legally binding.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and RPF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronez and Orenburg, joined.
In the past, Sviridov had said to the "Vedomas" that invitations had been sent to all proponents and that representatives of about 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who led the Vologododa sub-group (a further 15 sub-groups supported its formulation), said to "Vedomas" that she had not received invitations and had not planned to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy."
The blues singer Otis Rush died.
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago blues guitarist and singer Otis Rush died, reporting to AP with reference to his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's creation influenced musicians like Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
It was widely known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby," which peaked at number six on the "Billboard" R&B.
Admiral has caused us big problems.
Zinetula Bilaledinov: Admiral caused us big problems.
The chief coach, Ak Barza, Zinetula Bilalettedinov, summarized the performance of the regular CFL against Admiral (4:2).
"It wasn't a simple game, it was complicated.
The opponent was a worthy warrior, causing us great trouble.
I'm glad we played pretty well today.
I've already told you that someday the heads will come, and it's important that we work on it.
And that we won too is very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
"We have his own program that he's working on.
So there was this solution," quoted Bilaletdin's word for the club's press service.
Ilon Mask will be leaving the position of head of the Tesla Board of Directors.
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask will be required to leave as chairman of Tesla's board of directors and pay a $20 million fine.
In doing so, the businessman will retain his position as CEO of the company, reporting to AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Earlier, the regulator filed a lawsuit against Ilon Mask - officials believed that he had misled Tesla's investors because a businessman had given up all the company's shares at a high price of $420 for paper.
In the Loko match, "Ahmat," Turbin's mistakes blew out like a horn of abundance.
A former union judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of the Arbitrator, Yevgeny Turbin, in the 9th tournament of Russia's Lokomotive Championship, "Ahmat," and dealt with controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Evgeny Turbin in the Locomotive-Ahmat match?
- I believe this arbiter has confirmed that he is unfit to judge the Russian prime league match.
It surprises me that the fifth Spartacus tour, Dynamo, neither Turbin nor the leaders of the DSI have drawn any serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of crude methods blew out of the horn of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute, Eder's railwayman is dropping his Ahmat's protector Rodolfo with his hands in his punishment area.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put a penalty on it.
- How do you estimate the episode of Idova, who was 82 minutes away when it seemed like the ball hit him in the arm?
- I think there was a deliberate play by a defense attorney in his punishment area.
Turbin was right next to the moment, and he saw the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three of them slept together, and the penalty wasn't set.
So the score was distorted, and sports justice was violated.
It was the very case where the judgeship, by definition, pushed out and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who broke the rules in the fight against the Pied Piper, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he gave him a demonstration applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card weren't exactly on the case.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the double standards match that some teams are being penalized for violations like the Idova episode, and some aren't.
What do you appreciate the words of a football player?
- Depends what double standards mean.
It was a penalty.
He wasn't given.
So the arbiter doesn't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who's playing.
The Locomotive played on Saturday and the Ahmat had serious concerns about Turbin's work because the team was hurt.
Matt Damon played the accused of raping Judge Cavanaugh at the start of the SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a senate hearing on the charge of rape.
A candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court previously drew attention to his emotional and detailed stories in an interview with Senator Amy Clobobshar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but stated that he had never been drunk before memoryless.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Damon also played those moments.
All I ever did was drink a lot and never thought about sex.
I was the proudest, most drunkest virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in Matt Damon's performance.
Previously, Cavanaugh was elected Chief Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found his cloned dogs weird in their behavior.
American singer Barbra Streisand stated that her dead dog's clones behave differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clans] look like her, but it's impossible to clone a soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a breed of coton de tulear named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a dog named Miracle Milly, called the world's smallest dog, had been cloned 49 times.
Professionals are involved in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniaturous.
The US is thinking about Russia's maritime blockade because of oil and gas supplies.
In the U.S., Russia may be subject to a maritime blockade to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities have been so keen to fight for the success of the world hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's major suppliers of energy.
Ryan Zinke, the head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, spoke about the possibility of a maritime blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Department of the Interior did not perform police functions but civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Zinke ' s statement therefore fell within the purview of his department, although it was not deprived of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinc stated that the U.S. Navy controlled sea lanes in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need might be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russia's supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion ' s share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motivation for Moscow's revitalization in the region, sure Zinca.
The Secretary of State has made it clear that the US is still looking forward to leading the world energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do so, Washington will have to crowd out Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure along this path - believes Zinka.
The Kalmutz director received good reviews of the festival.
Our Earthman, actor Evgeny Sanghadzhiev, and his film Harmony (Harmony) have received special mention from members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "Movement," which took place in Omsk.
The particular festival diploma states that "it's a signal for the immediate response of major industrial players to the cinema."

The main prize in this competition was "Jana is Anya the other way around," the director's debut for actress Jana Glady.
The emphasis of the National Film Festival "Movement" is made at a young film, not in terms of the age of the producers, but in their spirit, willingness and ability to risk.
And Evgeny Sangajiev, a graduate of the Elistine School of Arts named P. Chonkusov and Rati-GITIS, meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative and seeks new and innovative forms of expression in his creativity.
More than 300 Syrians left the Idlib de-escalation zone in 24 hours
In the evening of 29 September, 301 people left the Idlib de-escalation zone in Syria in 24 hours, including 141 children, at the Centre for the Reconciliation of Hostile Parties.
The evacuation took place through the Abu al-Duhur humanitarian corridor.

In the Sahel region, there is a campaign to immunize the population against influenza.
Health professionals in the island region encourage residents to be more active and not to ignore doctors' recommendations.
This year, the vaccination target is 219,000 inhabitants of the region, including at least 70 per cent of all children.
To date, 49 thousand Sahalians and chickens have been vaccinated.
More than 10,000 visitors went through this procedure at the South Sahelian children ' s health centre.
According to health professionals, the most at risk is to catch children from six months of infection, transport workers, educational and medical personnel and those who are more likely to contact large numbers of people.
All of them can give flu vaccination free of charge.
Nor do people with chronic illnesses, pregnant women, and students pay for injections.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be placed in serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
The Director-General of the Central Institute of Aerohydrodynamics, Zhukovski Kirill Sipalo, announced this.
He said that the research centre was working on supersonic issues, both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It would take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, as well as another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine that allows transportation across the vast areas of our homeland," added Sypalo.
He explained that Russian experts now had the question of how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
At the beginning of September, the developer of the Touplev Aeroplane announced the completion of pre-project work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, which was calculated to allow the aircraft to reach a speed of 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
The Deputy Director General of the Valery Solosobos Company reported this.
The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He announced it on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm the words of columnist Washington Post that Putin's aggression against Ukraine had resulted in the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine and the accession to NATO supported 16% of Ukrainians.
Now it's more than 54%.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, European integration of Ukraine and EU accession supported 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did this?
Putin," said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more prepared to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely certain that we will not return to the Russian Empire," emphasized by the President of Ukraine.

Formula 1 Russian Grand Prix
There's a club in Russia that I'm watching.
Former captain of Chelsea and England's team, John Terry, about why he was at the ninth tournament of the Russian Spartacus - Rostov (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm watching.
I was watching very recently, and I was interested in seeing him from the outside.
I can't say that I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus, and I want to apologize again for the decision taken, says Terry on Chelsea's fans' website.
Let's remind them that Rostov, with 18 points, was ranked third in the tournament table, and Spartacus was placed on the fifth line with 15 points.
On the next tour, the red and white will play with Yenisei on 7 October, and Valeria Carpina's wards will receive Orenburg the previous day.
The expensive violin was turned into a pawn shop for no price.
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, for a tool that looked old and unrepresentative, the pawnshop worker offered only $50.
But Dylan McDermitt's experienced store manager suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked for expert advice.
That's where it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Galliano and is worth $250,000.
The strings to the violin alone are estimated at $168,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from a resident of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who put it in the pawnshop, but no previous clashes with the law were recorded.
The manager says that now all the pawnshop violinists will be asking to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are facing an exciting battle: Spartacus will receive a man at his stadium in Tushin, Rostov, under the leadership of Valerie Carpin - a man known to be not a foreign "people's team."
It is particularly picant to this meeting that clubs now have an equal number of points of 15, and they divide 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, falling behind the far-flung Zenita and being in the same glass from the Krasnodar that plays with Dinamo tomorrow.
The red-whites now have a rough patch: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals; in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew into Rapida, and recently gave way to the house of Ahmata.
After a derby with the CSKA, which ended in a fair tie, Spartacus played at the Black Sea Cup with a minimum score, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club is nearing the end of the crisis.
The Rosts could not win three consecutive matches, but the defeats have not been known for five games.
Let's see if Carpin can prolong the win-win series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting between Karpin's "Rostova" and Spartacus ended in favour of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is shaking after a powerful tsunami.
In Indonesia, where an earthquake triggered a three-metre tsunami a few days ago, meteorologists observe more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnet was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reporting on "Russia 24."
There were more than 420 deaths and more than 500 injuries.
The authorities informed the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect the coming of the wave.
The fate of dozens of other people who were preparing to celebrate the national holiday on one of Pala ' s precincts, which was most destroyed after the elements, is still unknown.
London has been levelled with accusations against Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, stated British Secretary of Defense Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he emphasized during the speech at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are operating in grey areas with cyberattacks and false news, added the Minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians in Moscow have repeatedly been refuted, transmitted to TASS.
At that time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, announced that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the history of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury last March of former GRU Colonel Sergei Scripala, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on accession to the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighbouring Greece about the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first votes was by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a warm supporter of the renaming of the republic in Northern Macedonia.
International organizations are watching the preparations for the referendum and today ' s vote.
Jan Petersen, Head of the Monitoring Mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, described how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams travelled across the country to observe the entire process today, from opening polling stations to closing them, then counting votes and drawing up records.
For a month, 10 of our teams have been working in the country to monitor the preparations for the vote, the media, the implementation of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of a referendum.
Fae Dulgeri: "How many 500 foreign observers closely monitor the voting.
The observer groups shall record in detail what is happening and shall communicate with the members of the electoral commissions in order to present them in the final report."
Translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentalitis of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a major role in mutual understanding.
On International Translator's Day, September 30, this was reported by a professional Sinchronist translator, Burbel Sachs.
She has been working on translations from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan things calmly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "why do they bother, let's go fast?"
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding among nations and for the work of an interpreter, it does not play a significant role," said a specialist in the comment "RIA News."
According to the interpreter, to understand that two countries need each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, noted Saxe, there is no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that the country was trying to "connect" with Russia and maintain them.
She said that Berlin Mania was particularly interested in the "North Flow 2" gas pipeline project, which was being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the Baltic Sea.

The day is expected to be cool - +14...+16 °C.
The air temperature at night will be + 10... + 12 °C.
The last day of September was marked by low air temperatures in Ukraine, which were compensated by the bright sun.
Natalia Didenko wrote about this on her Facebook.
According to her, this dry and cool weather came from Tom's countercyclone, which will continue to determine the temperature regime on Monday, 1 October.
On average, Ukraine is expected to have 13 to 17 degrees of heat in the afternoon of 1 October, 17 to 22 degrees in the south and Zakarpatia.
It will also be dry and sunny in Kiev on the first day of October.
The temperature will be between 2 and 5 degrees of heat at night and between 12 and 15 degrees of plus by day.
"The night was cold, the next night wasn't honey, either, but I hope that a sunny day will make up for home pants and so early evening fluffs," Didenko commented on her prognosis, congratulating Ukrainians on the holiday - the day of the holy Vera, Hope, Love and Mother of their Sofia.
Let us recall that the previous nights were marked by frost on the ground in the western and northern regions of Ukraine, as well as in the Vinnitsk region.
Putin appointed a new president's head of foreign policy.
Vladimir Putin released Alexander Manjosin from his post as head of the foreign policy office of the President by decree.
Igor Neverov was appointed to replace him.
Mr. Manjosin has been the head of the foreign policy office of the President since 2004.
One of the reasons for his departure was that the Kremlin's close source "J" referred to personal circumstances, noting that there were no significant claims in terms of the quality of the work to the head of management.
Igor Neverov previously headed the Second European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In 2009-2014, he served as Russian ambassador to Sweden.
The Russians donated one ruble to a deputy with a low salary.
In Yekaterinburg, the People's Charity Foundation opened a fund-raising campaign for a deputy of the State Duma of Vera Ganzi, who complained about low wages.
The campaign can be traced to the organization's website.
The "Mankind Foundation" expresses the hope that we will be able to save the people's servant throughout the world.
We ask all concerned to give a chance for life and a happy future!
All the funds raised will be transferred personally to the poor.
"God save you!" said the foundation's message.
All they want is 380,000 rubles for a deputy, which is a month's salary.
The reports on the assistance received are published on the Vkontakte fund's page, where the organizers are posting screens of remittances.
The most frequent donations are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication, the Russians donated 1,633 rubles to Vera Ganze.
Fund-raising was launched on 28 September following Ganzi ' s complaint about low income.
According to her, the average salary of a deputy is 380,000 rubles, and there is nothing left of them, so it is necessary to spend money on a credit card.
Ganzya complained that parliamentarians would not be compensated for representational expenses.
Subsequently, the State Duma stated that it would consider the possibility of paying representational expenses to the deputies.
The golden sink of the San Sebastian festival received the film "The Between the Two Seas."
The painting "Entre dos aguas" by Spanish director Isaka Lakouesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The Lenta won the main award of the festival, the Golden Scorch.
Norwegian actress Pia Thielta won the Silver Spot Award as the best actress for the Blind Spot.
The best actor was named Argentinian Dario Grandinetti for the film "Rio.
The director of the same film, Benjamin Naystate, was awarded the rank of the best director.
The Night School Comedy was led by an American box office.
The Night School comedy debuted at American cinemas last Friday, making $28 million in its first weekend in rent.
This result allowed the unscathed painting of Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the U.S. box office during the 28 - 30 September season.
On the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the fight for the first line of Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, has fared well ahead of another Western rookie, the Smolfoot cartoon, the curious history of dating a charming Yeti to a human race that the main hero never believed existed.
Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reysig's director's project raised $23 million over their start-up weekend, largely meeting the expectations of experts who predicted a 20 to 25 million tape for the weekend.
With regard to the sum of Smolfoot's fees, they currently amount to $38.6 million (which has already been debuted in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active, with a $3.6 million contribution to the film's coffers.
Three of the strongest this time closed the children's story "The Secret at Home with Hours" from the master of the horrors of Eli Roth, who finally proved that the director could make a quality movie for an audience of 12+.
In her second week in rental, the screens of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total world fees to $53.8 million.
Despite the escape from the top three, he continues to wonder about the "+" trigger with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick's "Simple Request": in 17 days in an American rental, Paul Figg's painting, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments were not originally expected from the word "soon," raised $43 million (including 6.6 million in 28-30 October) and now has a total of 62.9 million proceeds.
The last representative of the first five this week was a chorror, the nun's curse, who collected $5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-off of "The spell" after 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has $330 million in total earnings and has recently been proud to be the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of "The spell" itself and two tapes about Annabel's creepy doll.
Following the horror of Corinne Hardy's last weekend, another member of the genre, Hallfest's debutant, one of the main youth horrows of the year, was deployed.
In his first weekend, the children of a famous installer (and a recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked in a number of large chorror projects, including the Happy Day of Death, which Hallfest had a very similar experience, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is very positive.
The seventh was "Insanely Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), who seem to be not thinking of falling out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy that has been on the screen for the seventh week is the sixth highest-rated cash tape of genre in the history of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that has so far earned on the domestic market, with a total revenue of $218.8 million.
With regard to the last three lucky people who were in the top ten of the U.S. collections from 28 to 30 September, they were Predator, White Boy Rick, and...Baggler Mint, who earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million, respectively, over the last weekend.
In addition, next weekend the US will be gathering the long-awaited "Ven" with Tom Hardy, who - no doubt - will have no major problems in leading the American box office after the first weekend of October.
From next week's premiere, one should single out the musical melodrama "Star Born," the winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate."
The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid tribute to the memory of the victims of Nazism in Italy.
In Marzabotto, in northern Italy, some 770 people were killed in September and October 1944 in commemoration of the Nazi punitive operation.
Most of them are women and children.
This year, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Haiko Maas, participated in the ceremony.
He said that "with deep sorrow and great shame" he was bowing to the victims of the murder and their families.
Maas promised to counter nationalism with the struggle for freedom, mutual respect and friendship between Italy and Germany.
His Italian colleague Enzo Moavero-Milanesi arrived with the German Minister in Mardzabotto.
At the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is stressed that the heads of foreign policy agencies are participating together for the first time in the ceremony and that this is a symbol of the desire of both countries to preserve the memory of past crimes.

Valerie Belov: God helped Siberia today.
Valery Belov, Chief Coach of the Vityas, on the Shibiri defeat (3:4) in the regular CFC Championship match.
"The Collega was talking about the Sibiri fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," says Belov's official website, "The Vityasia."
"I hope they'll also support it, 'cause now almost every game is full of stadiums, great atmosphere.
By game, perhaps God was helping Siberia today because they were very rude, especially our leaders.
In fact, we lost the micro-game of 0-3 to our top leaders, so it was hard for us to pull this match out, even though there were moments.
But I'm gonna take the blame anyway.
'Cause they must have missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's an ugly nerd."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice for "Voice"
The audience of the "Voice 60+" show accuses the mentor, Leonid Agutin, of "indecent nerdism and insolence."
When he learned his father's voice from his first note in blind auditions, Nikolai Agutina had hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the artist.
But his son's feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to join his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor's bias in the first phase.
But the "joke" took a long time, and the star's father took the place of the more worthy artists without justification.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were appalled by the nefarious and open-minded manner in which we dragged our close relatives to the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his dad all the way to the top of the line, thinking Irina Petrovskaya and Xenia Larin on "The Man on TV."
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "wrote" the beautiful singers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a moving song about his mother, explaining what the audience still wanted to see on his father's show.
But, as it turns out, that's not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation and the finals are really talented artists, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I feel sorry for the members of the "Voice" on Agutin's team - they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, he was supposed to be a professional today."
"The competition has lost its meaning."
"Delete two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how do you call a mentor after that?"
"I like how dad sings, make him a concert in the Kremlin for your money, and see how many people come to this concert."
It's "Voice," not "Cool Relatives."
"It was unprofessional on the side of Agutin."
"Then on your own show, you have to ask your dad to perform, not on a show that's made for 1 Channel money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other player with real vocal data.
Why did a surgut worker with a gorgeous voice and a tembro leak, and Agutin's dad got to the finals?
And then we all complain that on the stage and from the screens, the same faces have been on the scene for decades!
'Cause you can't get through the clown!"
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's blah, there's nerd.
And the family budget is gonna be a lot of money!
The theater of absurdity continues!"
The users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice," the son of Gradsky appeared on blind auditions.
That's when it didn't occur to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I get it."
Agutin couldn't do as a professional.
War Canada was allowed to wear beards to raise the spirit
The Department of Defense of Canada has issued an order allowing soldiers to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions for the care of the beard.
It is noted that the military may be ordered to shave for "security reasons."
The military beard cannot be longer than 2 cm, nor must it be carefully trimmed and the neck and cheekbones shaved.
At the same time, the Navy was allowed to carry a beard only on land.
It is expected that the innovation "will raise morale in the army and attract more Canadians to the service."
The prohibition on wearing beards has been in effect in the Canadian army since World War II.
It was previously reported that French police officers were also allowed to wear beards and even to have tattoos.
At the same time, the Egyptian court upheld the suspension of police officers wearing beards.

Companies and officials face punishment if they do not submit the building data to the Integrated Housing Information System in time.
The innovation will help those who choose to buy an apartment in the new building, but fear the bankruptcy of the developer.

Due to amendments to the equity building law, developers will have to borrow fully from the bank.
And a lot of experts have already talked about the possible high cost of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the centre of Kiev, the robber threatened the man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from the ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September on Ivana Kudri Street, and was reported by the law enforcement officers in the capital.
According to the victim, an unknown person approached him and engaged in a conversation, but then suddenly took the knife and demanded that he give him the money and his mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the money to be removed from the bank card.
After the assailant received 4,000 hryvnias and a phone, he hit the victim and fled," the report says.
The law enforcement officers were able to apprehend the robber, and they turned out to be a 25-year-old Kiedalanin.

The scientist described a possible scientific programme for the Russian Federation's expedition to the moon.
RIA Novosti, Head of the Institute for Space Research of the Republic of Iran and Associate Member of the RAN Anatoly Petrukovich, described a possible programme of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was in the process of developing areas for such work.
"No consolidated opinion yet," emphasized the scientist.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the Moon, thus avoiding interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space-based radio sources," Petrukovich added.
He also believed that the Moon could be used to test robotics and use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite, according to a scientist.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of Roscosmos Corporation said that in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation, a manned flight to the Moon could take place by 2030.

The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was imprisoned and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of property and criminal offences and was also prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.

The SBU identified and detained the owner of the Peugeot-301 vehicle, who had travelled to the capital the previous day with the registration plates of the so-called "DNR."
He was a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who is currently working as an agent of a Ukrainian insurance company.
According to the SBU press centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been wanted by Interpol since 2014 and had therefore been detained in Russia and handed over to him as a representative of an insurance company.
When crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he removed the fake licence plates, but he installed them again at the entrance to Kiev.
According to him, he did so "to ensure that the vehicle registration numbers of the package of documents for the said vehicle issued by the Russian representatives of Interpol conformed to those of the Russian Interpol in the event that the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ukrainian police."
"A set of measures is under way to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish its possible involvement in terrorist activities," stated the BAS.

In the U.S., they announced a possible maritime blockade against Russia.
The United States can impose a maritime blockade on Russia, if necessary, to prevent it from supplying energy to countries in the Middle East.
The U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, said so.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that for the Russian economy the only source of income was the sale of energy, and Moscow was pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it did in Europe, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar to that of Iran.
In the Minister ' s view, there are two options for dealing with it: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use it first, so pressure must be exerted and Iranian energy resources must be replaced.

I couldn't do anything, and it hurt a lot.
Sergei SAROTKIN: I couldn't do anything, and it hurt a lot.
Russian pilot Sergei Sirotkin, Williamsa, commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between two cars that hit me right away.
I lost all the positions I played on the start, the moment, right away.
Turned out to be in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us went to the pit stop, we'd get into the clean air, and the pace would come back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, he was fighting his partner, and he was in contact.
I understand he made a little mistake.
We ended up in this situation on the busiest track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it really hurt, to be honest.
"I don't want to talk about it anymore," he says, "I don't want to talk about it anymore," he says, "I don't want to talk about it."
Let's remind ourselves that Sirotkin was in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finishing on the 18th, the winner was British pilot Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes.
Tarpishev said it's absurd to remove Gzhetkov and Knunko from the base of Spartacus.
President Shamil Tarpichev of the Tennis Federation of Russia (TPF) commented on the suspension of footballers of Moscow's "Spartacus" by Denis Ghlenkov and Andrei Shnko from training with a core composition after a liking to the criticism of Chief Coach Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport Weekend."
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to such things.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the division on the team.
First of all, it's poems, you can read them, and you can see them as much as you like.
I wouldn't react to it if I were Carrera.
Everybody has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be quiet.
If Gheatkov and Knunko are playing likes, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italians lack flexibility in their perception of the situation.
And it doesn't serve as a normal team climate.
Spartacus doesn't have a game tonight, so it wasn't necessary to inflate the situation at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus has a lot going on in different lines, and it's unsatisfied after joining the youth.
Relations within the team don't seem to add optimism to this match," I'm sure Tarpishchev.
The game of the two teams will take place on 30 September and begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartacus, headed Chelsea's youth team.
Sirius teachers discussed environmental technologies with scientists
Teachers of the Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre "Kurchativ Institute."
A presentation by researchers took place within the framework of the Global International Convergence and Nature-like Technology Forum programme organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture was launched by the documentary "Kurchatova Codes," in which the President of the Kurchat Institute, RAN correspondent member Mikhail Kovalchuk, spoke about global challenges as a driving force for civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on Sirius' website.
The students learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of generating such volumes.
According to the organizers of the forum, environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today will help to solve this problem.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies and the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of technology like this is a unique thing, it's a huge good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is in fact the technological replication of wildlife systems.
There's a backside-- a deliberate intervention in a person's life.
There are always risks.
There was a car that started killing people under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quote REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The speakers were Julia Diakova, candidate of the physics and mathematics sciences, Vyacheslav Demin, director of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX-like technology of CS "Kurchat Institute," and Vyacheslav Demin, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX-technology.
The Sirius Education Centre in Sochi was established by the Talant and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational centre is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that all-Russian online information security competitions "Kibervoises" would be sent to Sirius for training.

Macedonia: No referendum due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "North Macedonia."
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of their historic province.
The name was changed to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, opening the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But according to EFE, only 34% of the appearance on Sunday's plebiscite "didn't reach the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the Skopje authorities may decide not to reject the renaming.

Kemerovchan outraged a herd of lambs in the cemetery
On September 30, an eyewitness reported on a well-known Kemer page on the social network that horny animals were walking freely at one of the local cemeteries.
The animals of a large flock passed between the fences and pulled out the grass.
Commentators expressed differing views: a local resident noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite could even help clear the area from weed and grass, but some of the city's inhabitants did not enjoy animal behaviour:
"It's graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for lambs to do there.
The lambs, of course, do not say that they are debauchery, but it is not a matter of doing so.
In any case, an eyewitness noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
What's the right thing to do?
There's no such thing as pressure.
That's right.
The word "push" in the meaning of "pull, influence, influence" is only phonetically available because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "accept."
We use that word because we think it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "fail" are not only not ethically close, but even in some way opposite.
See for yourself.
To get involved (church-book, obsolete) means "suffering, full, enough, enough to be enough for someone or something, to satisfy."
Satisfying, enjoying, that's what you're saying.
He used to have the meaning of "nothing, self-satisfying" - self-satisfaction.
The old-Slavian "widow" is related to the words "rule" and "vola."
Straightening, repressing, completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (squealing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "sweep."
A similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "solvation," as well as the imminent obsolescence of the latter, forced them to engage in contamination.
So we have this very "d[a] attract" that is also used in the letter through "a," which is not right and is not possible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
Okay, well, that's right.
But that word is outdated, in its correct sense, no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/humans have a negative influence on you from the top, use the word "press."
You can also use the "pressurize" design, but remember, it's cancellaritis.

"I guess so, but you never know how it's gonna work out.
It's gonna be hard anyway, because our car is clearly slower than Mercedes's.

Russia protected itself from terrorists through an operation in Syria
In three years, Russian military operations in Syria have killed some 100,000 terrorists, 85,000 of whom have destroyed Russian Aerospace Forces.
On the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, Victor Bondarev, the head of the Federation Defence and Security Council Committee, spoke about this.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air strikes: air and space forces carried out and continued to strike exactly at terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites in Syria have been destroyed in three years, such as ammunition depots, district strengthening and headquarters.
With Russian airstrikes, jihadist defenses were hacked - a decisive contribution to the Syrian government's advance, passing on to Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has also protected Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IG, banned in Russia) and "Jabhat al-Nusru" (proscribed in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the IG side, some 4,000 fighters from Russian citizens and about 5,000 citizens from post-Soviet countries have fought the TASS.
And these are only registered persons, apart from those who have not been identified, Bondarev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev pointed out that in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise it would be evil for us.
Boris Johnson's phones and a number of British ministers have been made available to the public

Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism.
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Walid Muallem, accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] Coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas targeted, and carried out mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law," he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists," as the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided with and implied "the planting of chaos, death and destruction in their path."
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost complete and that the country had become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence, with priority given to Syrian partners in the reconstruction of the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Host Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, stated that two United States F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor with prohibited phosphorus ammunition.

The President of Ukraine, Peter Poroshenko, believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The Head of State stated this during his visit to Kharkiv oblast, commenting on Hungary ' s issuance of its passports to Zakarpatya.
In defending Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he, as president, will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are in the east or the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the passport scandal with Hungary, which was intended to expel the Consul of that country from Beregovo.
"I completely share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said," noted the President.
According to FACTI, on 19 September a video appeared on the network recording the date of issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they swore an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the Hungarian consul, who appeared on the video of the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, should leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself or be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the Zakarpatsk Regional Prosecutor ' s Office had initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident is classified under the article "State treason."

Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the President's favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus now believes that the hostilities are nearing completion and that the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
The Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem, stated to the United Nations: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions had been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which had made their lives difficult and deprived them of their means of subsistence.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate and provide funds for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the US and the EU countries have refused to provide assistance to Syria, arguing that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.

For example, the company ' s leadership has recently been changed and extensive restructuring and fundamental changes in management have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this power was granted in February this year.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the CPI as fascist.
Mytropolit Ilarion, head of the Synodal Division of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany putting a yellow sharp star on a Jew, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it's for this purpose that this bill was created," said the mytropolit on the Russian 24 television channel (quota on Interfax).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the CPI and "to outlaw it," the clergy believe.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously reported that members of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of Bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the CPI of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The viceroy of Pochaevskaya Lover called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines.
Mytropolit Vladimir, the lieutenant of the St. Uspena Pochaevna Lavra, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and the Ukrainian shrines.
His address to believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the website of the municipality.
At various times in history, our predecessors and family members had to profess their faith and defend their holy places.
Given the situation that has arisen and the information that we have, and the threats of execution that are spreading, it is clear that we too will have to survive," mytropolit said.
He asked for support - prayer, morality.
The laurel's lieutenant also stressed that "it is likely that you will need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's granddaughters, by spirit, are threatened with slaughter, and therefore we will protect our holy place. '
Who cares about the fate of Pochaevskaya Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and a world shrine, must be prepared to protect it, as it is said in the address.
Mitropolite urged those who mislead the believers not to do so.
The CPI has canonical status as determined by Tomos on 29 October 1990 from the Church's Mother.
And now someone wants to make himself dependent on a newsman and a friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
A new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status our church has," noted the viceroy of the laurel.
He recalled that the CPI had been canonically independent and fully autonomous in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
What other Tomos do we need?" noted Mytropolit Pochaevsky Vladimir, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other Tomos faiths are independent of the Vatican?
The believers have some understanding and determination as to which temple they will go to.
However, someone wants to sow feuds and strife again.
Some are envied by the jealousy that the dome shines on the temples they want to destroy," the priest emphasized.
The Pochaevian laur is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located at the top of the Pochaev mountain, 70 kilometres from Ternopol.
Its first history dates back to the early 13th century.

The social lioness published another sad post in Instagram, which made her followers angry.
"I never thought feelings could have a price.
Life continues to teach me... and when I begin to understand people," Buzov wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a post and noted that the singer had not actually seen the real life.
"You haven't suffered yet.
"Handing every word, living in a normal, normal family," wrote @nataliama37.
There were also those who advised Buzova to go to psychologists or at least read books on the subject.
"Would you like to read the psychology literature?
What must we do to avoid making a victim?," wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were others who supported the singer.
"Ola, don't get upset.
Your man will not speak loud words throughout the country and then simply not do them," supported Bouzova @arina_prostyle.
"You're a queen and you need a king, and whoever traded you for paper just doesn't deserve you.
"Give up your nose and move on," wrote @kreszentia_f.
Nazarov had previously explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and to give up Buzova because the singer had no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we keep playing the right game, the wins will come.
Vladimir Vorobiev, head coach of Moscow's "Dinamo" - on the defeat of the Automobilist (0:1) in the regular CFC Championship.
"The good game was interesting, though it went to the goal," quoted Sparrowev's official website Autobilyst.
"We had to play very easily.
I really enjoyed the first period.
Didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, the competition got us a little bit, we stood up.
But we got a little "feededed" off.
The guys were doing great, doing the training.
I think if we keep playing the right game, the wins will come.
They don't score, they don't win with zero heads, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your opinion, did the Automobilist add to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign link.
On the pre-season, the teams were doing other things, playing a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey game.
The Automobilist is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalie.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but they didn't."

Nevertheless, the leader of the leading opposition party, the "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitzkoski stated that he would not vote in the referendum.
According to Naum Stoilkovsky, the spokesman of the party, Mitskoski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his opposition to the treaty, which considers it "adverse."
According to the spokesperson, the current referendum is deciding on the name of the country and no more than the party ' s strategic goal of achieving membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President Gheorghe Ivanov of Macedonia refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence; the Macedonian leader considered the country's renaming a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state is being established with a new name," Ivanov said.
The Agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during a solemn ceremony on the banks of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
The treaty should resolve a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje ' s path to NATO and the EU, resembled the TASS.

The U.S.A. is promoting an increase in the production of opiates in Afghanistan
Much has been said about the dramatic escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants have waged a real terrorist war against the authorities of the State and against the civilian population of the country.
This year has been a record year in the number of bloody attacks that have claimed the lives of thousands of ordinary Afghans," noted Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start long ago.
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was the Al-Qaida terrorist group (forbidden in the Russian Federation) in Afghanistan.
Not even a month later, America and NATO allies began military operation "Unbreakable Freedom."
It's been 17 years.
A massive American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more ghost than it was then.
The American troops are trapped behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off fighters for money, as long as they don't get touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% from the Taliban (forbidden in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% for ISIL terrorists (proscribed in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudohaliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
It is also gratifying that over the 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40fold.
Colossal growth in areas planted with opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in the EU and NATO accession referendum, subject to a change in the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour ' s right to be called Macedonia, seeing in that name the attempted Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, a political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement of Macedonia or North Macedonia, is entitled to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will establish the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy."
The country is being renamed by the ruling Social Democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against: Conservative opposition and President George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Long of those who do not like the agreement feel that the current socialist government, led by Zaev, is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, loss of sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fae Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choices that Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans but also of Europe as a whole."
