The rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to improve the availability of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Huhan, Chinese province of Hubei.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was the cause of infection.
Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has become known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 are suffering from mild diseases, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developed into a more severe form, requiring hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% is critical when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyses cumulative COVID-19 morbidity trends in each European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We are also comparing the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK with the data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is now evolving in the rest of the world in the same dynamic as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance of March 5, 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the WHO criteria for disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, with all three of them returning from Huhan in the Chinese province of Hubei.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 deaths, including 1,441 deaths, were recorded in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates data on the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world every day at 8 a.m. from official sources, such as the ministries of health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases, COVID-19 was calculated as a reduced cumulative COVID-19 disease in 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 current in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country on 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative COVID-19 disease in the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK were generally in line with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
Cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK as a whole began to increase on about 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp jump (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom experienced similar trends in cumulative COVID-19 (additional).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, compared to Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8.00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases registered in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 morbidity suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, despite differences in the response of national public health authorities and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for COVID-19 analysis, including "completion" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions were already fully staffed.
To date, data on the admission of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6 per cent and 1 per cent respectively (not available).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data in order to complement the current monitoring data on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study carried out in 2010-2011, there is considerable variation in the number of beds in intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
ECDC's sixth update report on the rapid risk assessment for COVID-19 presents modelling scenarios for the loading of health system resources with estimates of hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK where the risk of lack of accessible beds in intensive care facilities exceeds 90%.
Since cases are now grouped into certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are usually served by the population of a particular territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, at level 2 Nomenclatures of territorial units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario and for the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach, moving from deterrence to minimization, is important to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases, decision makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to understand, take and adjust their responses accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, other EU/EEA countries ' health systems will face an influx of patients in the coming days or weeks that will require intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and elsewhere and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the SARS-CoV homologous virus, which led to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and mortality than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid growth in the number of publications on new diseases, this article offers a relevant and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Celebration (Chinese New Year), which took place on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and many weeks after the outbreak of a new virus infection.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As at 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been detected, more than 40,000 patients had recovered and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "enemy number one for society" and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus from a range of patients.
This review is an attempt to consolidate research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-induced coronavirus-related Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) disease, which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at this time about the prevention and prediction of the current of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronavirus has traditionally been a pathogen that is not fatal to humans and is mainly responsible for about 15% of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have twice faced highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other States with appalling levels of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the present COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, it was the first time that Pneumonia of unknown origin was reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, a genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal incident was recorded in Ouhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health workers had been infected, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, the city of Ouhan was quarantined and urban public transport stopped operating.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Ouhan, which was considered the starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to some 50 other countries worldwide (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scope and extent of the outbreak risk remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided the following update of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has been exposed to all age groups, but mainly to people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days between the symptoms of COVID-19 and the diagnosis took place.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time between symptoms and death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-482.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons, coinciding with large-scale transport traffic on the eve of the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-459%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one thread of meaning RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronavirus are known to affect humans.
In the case of coronavirus types SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of skin-lined shipoids (S) is associated with cell receptors of type 2 angiotenzin enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidasis-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the virus RNA genome; after replicating the virus genome, the genome RNA, together with the shell glycoprotheins and proteins of the nucleocapse, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence reports appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta coronavirus, with a 99.98 per cent genome that coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected at the first point of the outbreak at the Juanan seafood market in Wuhan.
In genetic terms, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-tonic sections of the human respiratory epithelium with the help of an elucidating electron microscopy.
The ACE2 human enzyme is found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ACE2 enzyme of a person weaker than in SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-lived protein, coded orf3b, and secretable protein, coded orf8.
The protein orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play a role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a group of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) submitted reports on the cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of the full-size ACE2 enzyme of a person with a resolution of 2.9 Å in conjunction with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S-proteins, which is proof of coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to control SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civitis and camels, respectively.
By means of a philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was established that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 were bats, as the new virus was 96% identical to two SARS-like coronavirus, namely the coronavirus of bats SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate master the virus has succeeded in breaking the species barrier and in infecting humans; the path of transmission also remains to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) suggested with colleagues that snakes had become vectors of the virus from bats to human beings, during which homologic recombination had taken place in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins - long-blooded mammals that eat ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - were potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2, based on a 99 per cent genetic resemblance between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1 per cent difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that final results with specific evidence are not yet available (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus by ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There is currently no data available on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronavirus, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the virus in the host system first recognizes the inborn immune system by means of receptor imagery (PRD), including receptors of lectin C-type, receptor-like Toll, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which contain the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis for viral antigens.
However, with N protein, SARS-CoV can avoid immune reaction.
Soon an adaptive immune response will be included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including T-cells CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the body.
The CD4+ T cells stimulate the production of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and the CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the function of the T cells by causing their programmed death.
Human immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibody, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies separated from a healthy patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst-case scenario, lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has a cluster effect, is more likely to affect older persons with related pathologies and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have an immunized system.
According to a study of the first 425 cases of infection in Ouhan, the estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 and 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period averaged 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, based on demographic data from 8,866 cases, revealed an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for the health authorities to adjust the time frame of the quarantine measures imposed to reflect the most accurate calculation of the length of the incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease that are immunized.
The general practice has been 14 days of quarantine for persons who have had contact with the virus or who have been infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
COVID-19 ' s main and first symptom is often high temperature, which can be the only expression or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, respiratory problems, muscle pains, dizziness, headaches, throat pain, coldness, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the onset of the disease, some patients experienced respiratory and/or hypoxia.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) respiratory symptoms and acute fever should be tested for virus with a view to early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies on chest scans.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent breathing and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial ventilation of their lungs.
Similar results were obtained from the two most recent studies of family infections and transmission of the virus from non-symptomic infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 for MERS-CoV patients, who also had high temperature (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and breath (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial ventilation of their lungs, which is much higher than for COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26 per cent) and throat pain (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99-100 per cent), dry cough (29-75 per cent), breathing (40-42 per cent), diarrhoea (20-25 per cent) and throat pain (13-25 per cent), while artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 14-20 per cent of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world was 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37 per cent of 2,494 confirmed cases.
In an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) between 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2-4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new infections is lower than the last two.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult to contain than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Clustering often occurs when infected within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason, or who are taken together in a transport operation, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often travelled to Uhan town or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or infected persons during the last two weeks before the disease began.
According to the reports, however, people may be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and treated patients may be re-producers of the virus after leaving the hospital, a warning signal for the extension of the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopies with leukocytes < 4x109/L, including leukocytes < 1x109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagin-amino-transferasis and virusemia.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were found, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood heritrocyte sedation.
For patients with severe disease, the D-dimer level, the product of fibrin decay present in the blood, has been raised and the number of lymphocytes has been steadily decreasing.
Most of the patients from COVID-19 found pathologies in X-ray thorax with uneven blackness on both sides or blackness in the type of "mata glass" in their lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease.
Uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of gas exchange during the development of the RPI.
The disfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of an X-ray study often coincide with the worst cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the isolation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and inter-tcan lymphocytic infiltration, and multi-nuclear syncial cells in lung patients who died of disease were consistent with the pathology of virus infection and ARI and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The method of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNAs by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (CPR with reverse transcription) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, given the high level of false negative results, which could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, China began to diagnose clinically as of 13 February 2020 (no longer relying solely on the PCR with reverse transcription).
The same was true of SARS diagnostics.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine data on the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK methodology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which allows the detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at a density of 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) with indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in dealing with a previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide COVID-19 patients with only supportive therapy, while at the same time attempting to use any therapeutic methods used or offered in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, plasms of cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of cured patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs and may also be less affected by other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, work impairment and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are assigned according to the severity of the disease, is critical to reducing symptoms and saving lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of a water-salt balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions, are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokin storm is a form of a systemic inflammation process developed in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the ARS and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for patients in severe condition, the suppression of immunity is essential.
The cytokine storm was treated with corticosteroids and tocilysumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interleukin-6 inhibitor.
Other treatments for cytokine storms based on the suppression of immunity include the modulation of immune responses aimed at controlling T cells; the blocking of the production of cytokines of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the suppression of Yanus-kinase; the use of blanatumohab, cytokin soups 4 and hystondeacetalaze inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the effects of the inflammation processes, steroids are widely used to suppress immunity in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful in treating severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses for corticosteroids in small and medium-sized doses are recommended for use with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, the internal introduction of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, proved to be effective treatment of an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, the remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with a single-chained RNA, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of this data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for a pair of tests on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are looking forward to it.
Baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavire/ritonavir and ribavirin were also suggested as options for treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinavire/ritonavir can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver lesions and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients who have been cured of an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect a healthy population has been used for a very long time.
Indeed, the blood of cured patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are found in an immunoglobulin produced by B-lyphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize and target selected molecules of pathogens.
On the basis of this assumption, plasma was released from blood samples of a group of COVID-19 patients, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation and viral load decreased, and their blood saturation with oxygen increased.
However, to suggest mass use of this method before the specific therapy is performed, it is necessary to have a pending test and an unexplained explanation.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some deficiencies in the application of plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can over-incentivize the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given the toxicity, is a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to identify the B-cells of patients who have recovered and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screenings to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of the virus.
That way we can move straight to mass antibody production.
Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of the formula, which varies according to the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternatives for treating patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of illness.
For example, the Su Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rate of recovery from COVID-19 was observed in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for 87 per cent of patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, the lowest rate of recovery was recorded (13 per cent).
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively by Western medicine and combination treatment by Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of the normalization of body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and the provision of inpatient care had been significantly lower for patients who had been treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who had only been treated by Western methods.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to suffer from symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely monitored research on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to have, to the extent possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the effectiveness of components used in Chinese traditional medicine or their combination.
Patients who suspect or confirm COVID-19 are mostly very afraid of acute and even fatal disease, and people who are closed to quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia against corticosteroids, may cause further anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, heightened anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.
Mandatory contact monitoring and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people ' s anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, persons under suspicion and in contact with them, as well as to all other persons who require it.
In the framework of psychological support, multidisciplinary mental health teams should be established, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from infected animals and infected people to vulnerable hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to control epidemics caused by new viruses.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to produce long-lived and high-activity antibody neutrals and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live, weakened vaccines against SARS viruses.
However, prior to clinical research, it is still necessary to determine the efficacy of these possible vaccines in the natural environment when applied to age patients, the model of lethal dose infection and the extent of protection against zoonic virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of diseases caused by the MERS virus continue to occur, originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions through the conservation of zoonic sources in endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for those without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed in order to contain the exploding epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average of 18 months) required for vaccine development and the dynamic modification of coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
It is therefore critical for health authorities to develop a prognostic model of disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical data provided to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the patient ' s COVID-19 current (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the spread of the SARS virus, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such treatment (an average of 66 years compared to 51 years of age), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Morbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardium and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to be able to communicate with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which could cause liver damage in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely linked and can distort results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: C-reactive protein levels in blood reflect the severity of the inflammation process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor for the current of the disease, the response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, higher levels of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagin amino transferasis, alanin amino transferasis and creatinkinazes may also predict the result.
These enzymes in large quantities are separated by different organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissues are damaged.
They are therefore traditionally the markers of cardiac or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in COVID-19 treatment, X-ray data from the thorax and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account, among other factors.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunity suppressors commonly used in infectious diseases as supplementary therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammation process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecosis, leading to life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are to be used to treat COVID-19 patients, they should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress because they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to alleviate the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological counselling and long-term support must be provided.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to differ from SARS.
In addition to lower respiratory replication, SARS-CoV-2, like other coronavirus, which cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory tracts and cause mild symptoms or do not cause symptoms at all at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who are at an early stage of the disease or who are not yet incubating can, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, which makes epidemiological monitoring very difficult.
However, it was believed that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are seriously ill, with most cases not occurring at an early stage of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than SARS, and it's harder to control.
China is currently engaged in a great deal of work through which it has declared universal quarantine in the city of Ouhan and neighbouring cities, and has extended the quarantine regime for virtually all the population, which has been introduced to break the SARS-CoV-2 distribution chain.
While these measures are detrimental to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients detected is decreasing, indicating a slowing of the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will be over by March, and the phase of extinction will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looked much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian specialists reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been found in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and had been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the decrease in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
According to initial projections, Ebola fever was expected to hit up to a million people and kill half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Figure 55) is given below.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of coughing or sneezing, and may also have direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the kale, which means that oral transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 cases investigated may have resulted from infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks for the face; and surgical masks and N95 class respirators (Serion No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microcaps of fluid from potentially infected people to fly into the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can protect virios of 10 to 80 nm from inhaling, they only pass 5 per cent virios; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five surgical masks folded together, health workers who are in direct contact with patients must wear class N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear a protective robe in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Virus can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have been in his system through his inflammated eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent face boards or closed protective glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are strongly encouraged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectant detergents, try not to leave home in self-exclusion and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of about a metre is considered acceptable to the patient.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its resemblance to SARS-CoV reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Uhan Center for Disease Control calmed the citizens, reporting that the new virus had low contagiacy and limited reproduction in human-to-human transmission and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has significantly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate China ' s New Year, and a critical time has been missed when the disease could be contained within the city of Ouhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements as each word is taken into account by citizens and may influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than to comfort the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to regularly test and improve public response.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 gave rise to a re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality among older persons is also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even in the unsympathetic course of the disease, while SARS patients usually infect others only in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples.
On the other hand, cured patients can again show positive samples for the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Against the background of this rapid progress in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus bats, we still can't claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original master, such as bats, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transmission route, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus inject itself into respiratory cells and trigger subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve in human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, also disappear as SARS, or will it recur periodically like influenza?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal.
The Zoonous Origin of Human Coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoV) and its carriers, including humans, over millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCV) causes a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus can be.
The appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 again drew attention to coronavirus and surprised us at the high transmission, but less pathogenic, of the virus than the SARS-CoV virus.
The coronavirus infection of humans is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonoid origin will be very useful.
Most human coronavirus come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate storage tanks of some human coronavirus are also known.
The definition of animal carriers has a direct impact on preventing the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronavirus can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
This review provides available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonoid origin and modes of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronavirus in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of coronavirus disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
The coronavirus is a family of Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest number of RNA viruses containing a genome containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, were named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles the crown.
In terms of structure, coronavirus contains unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further reprocessed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open readable framework for structured proteins, including whiskey protein (S), skin protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines have also coded a number of lineispecific accessor proteins.
Based on different sequences, proteins / coronavirus are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus), with beta coronavirus containing most human coronavirus and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronavirus is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly crossed inter-species barriers, and some have evolved to human-threatening pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alpha coronavirus HCV-229E and HCV-NL63.
The remaining five beta coronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Human coronavirus HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light shape, such as cold and/or diarrhea.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (SARS) and showing non-light symptoms.
The first strand of human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of noso-gulfed patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has resulted in more detailed knowledge of the HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that infection with human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused a long-term epidemic in the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadically to the rest of the world.
Found in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronavirus infection of 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of 3 March 2020, had claimed more than 3,120 lives and had infected more than 91,000 people.
A warning signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus have zoonosed origin, and their sources are bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of all human coronavirus from bats, to which viruses have been well adapted and in which there are no pathogenic properties but a wide range of genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
A study of the zoonic mechanism of origin of human coronavirus will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-species transport.
It may also suggest or accelerate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate and amplifying container, which is very important for preventing the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This overview contains general information on zoonological origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus occurred are not usually pathogenic for their storage systems, but are pathogenic after interspecies transmission to the new medium.
We are also analysing the evolution of human coronavirus, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by reduced pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCV-229E virus was first derived from a sample of nosole patients suffering from the cold, various coronavirus were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative summary of the history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966; the virus was subsequently adapted to reproduction in the lines of the pulmonary cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general malaise and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughs occurring between 10 and 20 per cent of the cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was removed from the organic culture and the subsequent serial transfer into the brain of suckers mice.
Clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic agents, such as influenza type A and pinavirus.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are common in the world and are generally transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Most of the incubation period of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the results of the volunteer study, healthy people infected with the HCV-229E virus developed a common mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity had severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the SARS epidemia of SARS pneumonia, was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the cause of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third known human coronavirus virus.
The first SARS case was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
With the exception of superactive distributors, it was estimated that each disease could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the virus load was 10 days of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general illness and chills, and later symptoms included breathing, cough and respiratory failure.
The common laboratory deviations from SARS are lymphopia, liver-sampling disorders and elevated creatinkinase levels.
SARS patients have also experienced diffuse alveolar damage, spilt epithelial cells and increased macrophagic levels.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation of their lungs.
Other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be infected in such severe cases in addition to the lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may prove fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
The virus was first isolated from the open biopsy of a minor relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been devoted to researching human coronavirus.
At the end of 2004, HCV-NL63 was released from a seven-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found to be mainly affecting young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
In the case of HCoV-NL63, the symptoms are cold, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolith.
Another independent study described the release of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an 8-month-old Dutch boy suffering from pneumonia.
The virus has been detected in the Netherlands, but it is in fact widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with the onset of summer, spring and winter diseases.
HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laring, which is also called croup.
HCV-HKU1 was released in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolith.
In addition to non-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolithics, HCV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthmal diseases.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, causing mild respiratory diseases, has been detected worldwide.
All four human coronavirus, which cause non-hospital infections, have been well adapted to humans, and their mutation, which leads to highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infection of lower respiratory tracts in China.
These human coronaviruses usually become less virulent or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to effectively transmit and preserve in humans.
The coronavirus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first released in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a lung of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal failure.
Most of the laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been cases of importation and spread through occasional secondary cases of contamination in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak, with 186 confirmed cases, occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical symptoms of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other coronavirus-related diseases transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have stomach and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases of high-mortality Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (34.4%) had been recorded, so MERS-CoV is considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
Between mid-December and the end of December 2019, pneumonic patient clusters were detected in Huhan, Hubei Province of China, and are now associated with the infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has declared that the continued outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency and the disease itself has been referred to as coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with about 3.4 per cent of deaths.
It should be noted that the mortality rate is 4.2 per cent in the Chinese province of Hubei and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by increased temperature, cough and breath.
Some patients are also diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is capable of rapidly converting to acute respiratory deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of filogenetic wood.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater ability to transmit than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been cases of unsympathetic SARS-CoV-2, indicating the potential of the virus to spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronavirus has a similar incubation period and duration of the disease that they cause.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronavirus.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus diseases causing non-hospital infections (i.e., HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those most commonly observed with human coronavirus infections causing non-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns that are common to both human coronavirus, which cause non-hospital infections, and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is at least as high as human coronavirus infections.
On the other hand, it has yet to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. each next person infected), as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that cause non-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in kala samples.
We have yet to answer the question as to whether the faecal-oral transfer route SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under certain circumstances) as in SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronavirus, which causes non-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable human transmission.
All four human coronavirus that cause non-hospital infections with mild symptoms were well adapted to humans.
On the other hand, these people may have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronavirus, which causes serious diseases in humans, and people whose human coronavirus causes severe diseases, simply didn't survive.
For this to happen, human coronavirus must be replicated in the human body to the extent that adaptive mutations are accumulated to counter the limitations of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus fully adapts to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among people through quarantine or other infectious disease control activities.
For many years, four non-hospital coronavirus have been circulating among the population, causing a common cold for people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reserve animal.
The highly pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to be preserved and reproduced in their zoonous reservoirs and to search for the occurrence of susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or reinforcing media.
SARS-CoV-2 has features like SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four non-hospital HCoV viruses.
It's very easily transmitted as non-hospital HCoV, at least for the time being.
But it's more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts entirely to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforcing and tank carriers of HCV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it transports a close-born ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestor virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the host-reservatory constantly transports HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCV was only entered in an intermediate medium in front of or around the time it was carried to a person, it was not well adapted to the new host and was often pathogenic.
This intermediate medium can serve as a zoonic source of human infection and can play a role as a strengthening medium, allowing the virus to replicate lightningly and then transmit it to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCV can withstand a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate medium and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural container carrier.
The epidemiological data showed retroactively that the zero patient of SARS was in contact with hunting and fishing animals (ditch) in an anamnese.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that the IgG antibody prevalence of SARS-CoV is higher than that of the general population.
The Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon dog in the animal markets were the first established carriers of viruses such as and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all cyvets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in most cases SARS-CoV had not been defined in the Himalayan civettes living in nature or on farms that were not marketed, suggesting that Himalayan civettes could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing medium rather than as a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies for SARS-CoV, it is not impossible to exclude the possibility that many small mammals may also serve as intermediate reinforcements.
They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV revealed a close-born bat coV bat, which was described as associated with SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 and is present in Chinese bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibody and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronavirus bats have 88-92% of the same homologies of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
SL-CoV has also detected several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) bats, but none of them, except one, which refers to a WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensine-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of fecal bats, uses ACE2 bats, cyvets, and humans as a receptor to enter the cage.
Curiously, the serums of recovering patients from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest parent to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of nucleotide sequence homologies.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not a direct carryer of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis refers to MERS-CoV in the same group as CV-HKU4 bats and CV-HKU5 bats.
CV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptyl dipeptidazu-4 (DPP4), to inject viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of the MERS-CoV virus is philogenetically closer to the sequences of beta coronavirus bats detected in Europe and Africa.
Until now, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homologies of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative COV-HKU25 bats match only 87%.
So the bats may not have been a direct MERS-CoV container carrier.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-arm camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are Middle Eastern camels in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was removed from the nasal swabs of one-arm camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV tank carriers.
It is also worth noting that camels who were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive virus exposure.
It is noteworthy that infected camels singled out the virus not only in the respiratory way but also in the faecal or oral way, which is also the main way to isolate the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have any contact with camels prior to symptoms, and are plausiblely attributed to human transmission or to the transmission of unknown channels that include unidentified species of animals that carry MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% similar to the CoV RATG13 bats selected from Asian Rhinolophus affinis.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the diversion of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships to them.
So bats may not be the direct bat carrier for SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical coronavirus of bats are found in the future.
Presumably, direct animal carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uhani wholesale market for seafood, which involved many initial COVID-19 cases, indicating a likely case of transfer from the animal to the human being.
Several recent metagenic sequence studies have concluded that a group of threatened small mammals known as pangolines (Manis javanica) could also bear the parent beta coronavirus, the related SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the nucleotides of these new genomics of pangolin coronavirus is 85-92% consistent with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to the RATG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.
They are clustered in two sub-lines of differential viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in a philogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-connecting domain (RDD) closer to SARS-CoV-2, with an Amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
Quite the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 strains are more diffuse, despite a higher degree of homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the definition of virus contigs in lung samples that were similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a genome sequence of about 86.3% full-size virus genome.
The possibility of pangolin becoming one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate carriers cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the diversion of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta coronavirus pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and beta coronavirus pangolines linked to SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path has not yet been established for bats, pangolines and other mammals.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RDS between SARS-CoV-2 and beta coronavirus pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 have the highest sequence homology across the genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of likeness between beta coronavirus pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours recombination between beta coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force for evolution, recombination is widespread among beta coronavirus.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV viruses, the zoonological origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses are also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can occur from coronavirus bats, while the parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It was reported that the coronavirus of bats, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge COV) and detected in the North American tricolor sausage, showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of bats called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although it was suspected that its intermediate carrier might be camel.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Philogenetic analysis showed the events of the inter-species transmission of HCoV in the anamnese.
When an inter-species transmission of the HCV-OC43 virus took place around 1890 and people were infected by pets, a respiratory pandemic was registered.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCV-229E is not so clear.
Alpha coronavirus of bats, closely related to HCV-229E, were found.
There's an alpha coronavirus alpaca between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was people, not alpacas, who could communicate with bats in the overall ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, alpha coronavirus of bats related to HCV-229E are diverse and not pathogenic, while alpha coronavirus alpaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha coronavirus alpaca was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacas are likely to receive alpha coronavirus related to HCV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nippah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while alpha coronavirus bats could be the gene pool of the HCV-229E virus, alpacas and single-arm camels could be intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of inter-species transmission from bats to one-arm camels and from one-arm camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known by its initial identification and was later confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of viruses for interspecies of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-term life, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flying ability make bats "perfect distributors."
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-arm camels a decade ago.
He has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from an intermediate medium to a stable and natural storage medium.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very slight disease and is characterized by relatively low mutations.
Its occasional transmission to a person is an accident, and a person remains a dead end of MERS-CoV because it is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta coronavirus pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be dead-end carriers of beta coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or eliminate several interspecies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a storage medium for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or cartilage of these animals.
Second, the pangolines can be one of the intermediate reinforcing media into which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus recently hit.
People are infected with the virus through carcase cutting and eating wild animal meat.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to many animals, including domestic animals.
A home and wild animal antibody survey is justified.
Third, as indicated above, SARS-CoV-2 recombination and adaptation could occur in its third form, which involved both bats and pangolines.
Search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal carriers, the three main factors on the virus side have also contributed to the intersection of inter-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered to be "moderate-high" with an average rate of rotation of approximately 10-4 replacements per year on one site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of coronavirus to new owners.
The coronavirus has an exorbonucleasis correction, the removal of which results in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening, or even non-reliability.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation frequency, SARS-CoV-2 mutations appear to be lower, indicating a higher level of human adaptation.
Presumably, this virus has already been adapted to another host close to man.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-arm camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the vaccines and antiviral drugs of SARS-CoV-2 will quickly become ineffective as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in genome modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-species co-evolution conducive to the emergence of new coronavirus if conditions are met.
This is facilitated by the many unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3' to the end of the genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirus is randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in a medium that serves as a mixing receptacle, the threads are often switched.
High-level, full-sized and subgenomic RNAs can recombin and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in animals of coronavirus, such as SL-CoV and BatCoV-HKU9 bats.
Synergy of vector virus with regard to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, another key factor for inter-species transmission is the interaction of the virus with the medium receptor.
This article refers to SARS-CoV as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-species events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV and civette strains, SARS-CoV is considered to be rapidly adapted in different media, especially with regard to mutations on the S protein RDS.
In general, the S-coronavirus protein RCD interacts with the cell receptor, and the antibody response of the host is heavily selected.
SARS-CoV RCDs are amino acids, 318 to 510, on S1, which binds an angiotenzin to the human enzyme 2 (APF2), as well as its coceptors, to inject the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus is capable of detecting the receptors of APF2 of different animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, making possible interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RDC, which are different from human virus strains and civets, of which 4 are in the receptor-linking motive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civettes have K479N and S487T mutations in the RDS, which can increase the affinity of the interaction between the physic protein and the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for adapting the virus to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 segment of the S protein leads to a change in the binding affinity of the S protein to the human APF2.
Indeed, a study using a cryo-electronic microscope suggests that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between the APF2 human and the S protein of the SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interesting to know whether any other co-receptors were required for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCV-NL63 also connects with APF2, but with another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as N aminopeptidasis for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylsial acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the inter-species transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other factors of dependency and restriction of the medium.
The diversification of these proteins between humans and natural HCovs, such as bats, single-arm camels and rodents, can constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The success of inter-species transmission of HCoV viruses requires the usurpation of dependency factors and the subordination of retrenchment factors.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorised.
An impartial, full-genomic screening of the dependency factors and retrenchment of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCoV development: Back to zero
The diversity of coronavirus bats creates great potential for new HCoV.
In this sense, the coronavirus of bats serve as a genetic pool for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, as SARS-CoV related bat viruses have been isolated, but it has been established that they code ORF8 divergent proteins.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, 29 nucleotides were found to be characteristic of SARS-CoV coronavirus.
This division divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha and gamma coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Localization of recombination was also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV had been subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which had occurred in one-fold camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs, where HCV recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely by ridding the virus of breeding pressures, for example, from the immune system of the medium.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to a two-nucleotide split.
While an artificial open reading frame for ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCV-229E, the alpha coronavirus alpaca shows a single nucleotide box, leading to a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also due to the pressure of sampling on their storage media.
When bats were contaminated with coronavirus, there were little or no symptoms, which showed that coronavirus and bats were mutually adapted.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, failure to activate the trigger response in bats effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats has been suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low expression of the molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of Class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of coronavirus while influencing the reading of exoribonucleasis, thus creating a sampling pressure to generate strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new medium.
The more pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the medium.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the last 20 years.
The coronavirus is not pathogenic or causes slight symptoms in its storage media, such as bats or camels.
They replicate with confidence without causing a strong immune response from the host.
That is the secret to why we see unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly associated with the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the greater the lung failure.
On the contrary, immunized immunized hosts have no replicability of coronavirus.
The same non-communicative response strategy can have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the acceptance of type I interferon at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should have a beneficial effect on humans.
In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasoma has been disrupted in bats.
Based on this, the inhibition of NLR3-inflammasoma with the help of MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta coronavirus of bats was found, the nucleotide homology of which is 95 per cent the equivalent of SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, which has a nucleotide homology of 96 per cent the equivalent of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have not been installed.
Beta coronavirus pangolin, amazingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, was found, suggesting that pangolines could serve as an intermediate medium or that fragments of the beta coronavirus genes of pangolines could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.
The coronavirus has attracted universal attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonosic origin and HCoV animal reserves in human broadcasting.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and were passed to a person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between people and civets in markets, the closure of wildlife markets and the destruction of civets in them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of various lines of beta coronavirus pangolines close to SARS-CoV-2, the pangolins should be removed to prevent zoonic transmission from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is passed on to humans through pangolines and other mammals, and how this may remain the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in one-arm camels.
These camels are an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop periodic MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, combined with other infectious control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks of disease may appear.
There are a variety of zoonic coronavirus circulations around the world.
In particular, the coronavirus of bats with zoonosis potential is extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonic coronavirus, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronavirus, which is more easily transmitted and/or more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe tests like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 steels, a better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new areas can be seized.
While many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if people are taught to stay away from them, the probability of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be minimized.
A better understanding of the environment of coronavirus and its natural carriers requires constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronavirus from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonosis viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments in the zoonic puzzle.
First, if bats have passed the bat virus SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolines, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolines share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate is played by a third mammal, we need to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangoline, or another mammal, it's expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary route SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspects of disease" and "confirmed cases" COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief reference manual on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experiences and provides refined recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually on the basis of current research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the document "Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19" (version 7) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak of 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was referred to as "heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference manual and published it on the Internet on the Military Medical Research website on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have increased gradually on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategies and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the National Health Committee's Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were issued, and some of its provisions have changed considerably.
Recently, Zhou ' s co-authors have commented on our recommendations, with simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic, which has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the high value of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of the Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (test version 7) and ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of the document (3 March 2020), in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis in order to confirm a case of suspicion of disease, it is necessary to combine one element of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or locations in Uhan and its environs or other localities where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its environs or other localities where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days before symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded for 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, class at school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white cells are normal or reduced, with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case of disease should be based on a suspicion of disease with one of the following points of pathogenic or serologic evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genomic sequencing of the virus shows a high homogeneity of relatively new coronavirus; (3) the positive serotest results for the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the result of the test from negative to positive for the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody IgG, or the increase of the titra at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the relevant indicator at the acute phase.
It may also be noted that a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in respiratory tracts or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document.
The pathogenic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and then the need for serological proof was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in search of an optimal set for detection of nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which improves the availability of different samples and promotes the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for disease confirmation.
There is, however, growing evidence of caution in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients with no express symptoms.
The route map presented in Zhou ' s work and others should therefore be updated, as it classified persons who did not have clinical symptoms as a "low-risk" group.
The assessment system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19 - day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Disease Ecology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 current cases were reported, as well as 33 recovering patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjaby Sabrina Flora, reported that four men and one woman had been victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two persons were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official told Anadolu local news agency that one of the dead was Jalal Sayfur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Meitri Clinic.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Kwader, announced that public transport would be discontinued for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport operations were stopped on 26 March and were due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods - medicines, fuel and food - was still authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who returned from Italy, as well as one of them's wife.
As of 19 March, the three men had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed a millionth of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday the total number of coronavirus infections with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
The coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
It came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of coronavirus death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which there had been no cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization had reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in 24 hours prior to 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stronger measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, extended the regime of self-isolation of the city's citizens until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite being self-sustained, would receive wages until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the state of emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 in favour, 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew had lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose curfews from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the regime of home-based self-insulation in the state was extended by order until May 1st.
Shops in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Coles chains reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that could be purchased once in every store in the country to two and one package, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in the cashiers ' ads, as well as on the Facebook page of the network.
Citizens are reported to have started to make emergency stocks because of insurance that COVID-19 may result in a general self-seizure regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already restricted this quantity to four packages.
The Coles trade network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with a restriction on four packages, "in many shops toilet paper is still being sold too fast - one delivery within an hour," and called such demand "unprecedented," while the ALDI Facebook post on Tuesday called such a trend "unexpected."
According to Woolworths, sales increased sharply last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that quantity to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles ordered larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Ritellers Association, reported that the handlers were trying to replenish the stock, but this was complicated by restrictions on truck travel by local authorities.
It expects a rise in the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stock depletion, some stores could not stock on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the University of Queensland of Technology, said that stores replenish supplies every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so that the quantity of stocks was small, and after the sale of the total volume, long rows of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of stock scarcity.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, the buyers probably wouldn't panic," Russell Zimmerman says.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper, Who gives a Crap, announced the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet paper manufacturer, Kleinex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent products, reported that they worked 24 hours a day to provide sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne decreased due to the absence of buyers during the Labour Day week, some real estate sellers began to offer free toilet paper to the first auctionees.
The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, first the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening, it was observed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado had also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization proclaims the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of infectious disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
While the term "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic."
This is possible if countries are involved in the detection, testing, treatment, isolation, surveillance and mobilization of their citizens," explained the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana Gebreisus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of the spread and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said in his interview with CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus except influenza has yet been monitored from its inception to its continuous global spread."
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that "we have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus.
Nor have we ever seen a pandemic that can be controlled."
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status, the pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fuchy, said of the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it will get worse."
According to Associated Press, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide on Thursday, with over 4,600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020 is the current coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome -2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Ouhan, China, in December 2019, and a public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, some 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
China ' s mortality rate is 4 per cent, while the world ' s mortality rate varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory problems.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment has been found at present.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and recommended preventive measures include hand washing, coughing, keeping a distance between people, identifying and ensuring the self-insulation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as widespread shortages of goods, compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world ' s students.
Disinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people reminiscent of them, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there has been a significant spread of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industries.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases were mainly related to the wholesale market for Juanan seafood, so the virus is believed to be of zoonosed origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2; it is a recently discovered virus with a high resemblance to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019, and that the virus did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in an unverified publication of the South China section of the Morning Post, it was suggested that the first case of contamination occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had decreased but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that new infections outside China had exceeded new infections in China for the first time.
The number of cases can be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the many cases with low symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide, and the United Kingdom ' s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Wallance, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted a formal policy of not testing only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China prior to 23 January and that 79 per cent of reported cases had been contaminated by such unregistered patients.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure could be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are recovering safely.
In other more complex cases, the time between the onset of symptoms and the time of death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with 14 days being the most frequent.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of deaths were associated with diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include dead people who have not been tested - for example, in the case of death in their home, in nursing homes, etc.
The incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures four to five times.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson acknowledges: "We know that [the claimed number of deaths] is lower than the actual." His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the US, which are often recorded with incomplete data in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza epidemic, the first confirmed death being recorded in Ouhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and on 14 February in France outside Asia.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary by region and time of spread; they are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatments used, the time of the outbreak of the disease and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health; the "mortality/incidence" coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections was 6.0 per cent (97,039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio declined from 17.3 per cent (for those who had symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had symptoms after 1 February 2020), while other methods include the definition of the mortality rate due to disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the rate of mortality due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain groups of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to the University of Oxford Centre for Proof Medicine, the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1 per cent and 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
Peak and the exact duration of the flash are not identifiable and may vary according to location.
Mathew Boni, a staff member at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to occur on the platoon, and then, when the number of available carriers ends, they start to go out.
In the present situation, however, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen."
The senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argues that "all can end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement the WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate, possibly for a year or two."
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is developed," physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Schuffner, an employee at Vanderbilt University, says, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it's so easily transmitted," and that it can "be transformed into a seasonal disease every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can endure the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperature (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory wetness (slime), loss of smell, breathing, pain in muscles and joints, throat pain, headaches, chills, vomiting, haemorrhaging, diarrhea or cyanosis, WHO claims to be seriously affected by respiratory problems of about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list immediate symptoms such as respiratory problems, permanent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty in awakening and blueing the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septical shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease may be unsymptuous, without any clinical signs, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that persons in close contact with confirmed patients be placed under strict control and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of symptomic current varies from a few to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; usually it is five days. There is still no clear indication of a loss of smell: the initial estimate of the percentage of COVID-19 patients who developed the symptom initially was 30 per cent and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details on how the disease is spreading are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air with cough, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, drops can spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) when the cough is open.
It is assumed that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops emitted into the air during conversation, which may remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops may also be formed during exhalation, including during conversation, although the virus is not normally transported by air.
The drops may fall into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac reanimation (CPR), may cause exhalation products to spray and thus spread the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted via faeces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is the most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There were cases where the tests were positive when tested three days before the symptoms appeared, which suggested that the virus could be transmitted before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomic current, but contact tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from nonsymptomic carriers.
European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) staff claim that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two or three other people. The virus can survive on surfaces from hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304), the virus was able to live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day and on the copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, even though the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces to which infected people may have touched.
Heavy acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus found for the first time in three people with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Ouhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by household soap that dissolves its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 has a great resemblance to the SARS-CoV virus.
He's supposed to be of zoonic origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subspecies of Sarbecovirus (cell line B), together with two other strains of bat viruses.
On a holistic genetic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RATG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference between amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin viruses and humans.
A whole gene comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of resemblance (92 per cent) exists between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolines are intermediate masters of the virus.
The virus can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by analysis of the polymerase chain reaction with a reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or by a computer tomography.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Ouhan showed that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and current processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a test method for the first line in COVID-19 diagnostics."
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is tested.
It can be performed on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
Results are usually available for periods ranging from a few hours to a few days.
Scapular swabs are usually used for the test, although swabs can also be used, and a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been accurate enough to obtain approval for widespread use.
In the U.S., Cellex ' s serologic test was approved for use in emergency cases by certified laboratories only.
Features of visualization of symptoms in X-rays and computer-assisted tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral misalignment by type of opaque glass and the absence of pleural exposes.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for drawing up an international database of confirmed cases of contamination.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, COVID-19 images not supported by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a major study was carried out comparing the results of the thorax CT and the testing of the PCR, and it was found that, while the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus through X-rays and computer-assisted CT scans, compact neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Prevention strategies include maintaining common personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth contact with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing napkins immediately after use.
Those who may have already become infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
To prevent transmission, physical distance from people is also recommended, and many Governments recommend refraining from any non-emergency travel to countries and areas affected by outbreaks and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some of whose members do not know where or how they were infected, and that health workers who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with others and eye protection, and that tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of the infection and to prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for that purpose had raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (Amnesty International), as well as over 100 other organizations, had made statements demanding that this type of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working to develop solutions to ensure confidentiality of personal data - for example, recording user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he receives notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, cutting nose and mouth, which is in fact ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (the Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when the hands are heavily polluted, and before eating, after sniffing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens up its protective cover.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat alcohol-based hands with at least 60% alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated by a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface with disinfectant begins to operate a minute after application) with 62-71% ethanol, 50%-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% vidone.
Other components, such as benzalconia chloride and chlorhexide gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspicion of COVID or its confirmation in an institution, such as an office or day-care facility, all areas of such space, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, should be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that, when coughing or sneezing, the mouth and nose should be covered from the back of the elbow or napkin and that the used hygiene items should be disposed of immediately.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as the use of the mask may limit the volume and range of air-dispersing, sneezing and cough products.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the main way of infection," masks are also recommended for use by those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks does reduce the number of face contact.
Several countries have begun calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, U.S.A., recommend wearing non-medical tissue masks. China highlighted separately the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong is encouraged to wear a medical mask in public transport or public places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make face masks at home and to wipe them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has instructed all visitors to the grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks a day have been produced since mid-March, was required to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask on their way out; those who could not buy masks were advised to sew them on their own in the home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding people's places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many Governments of regions particularly affected by the outbreak are now prescribing or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people that can be assembled in one location, as recommended by U.S. government and health organizations, has been reduced rapidly, from 250 (in regions where there was no COVID-19) to 50, and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned groups of more than two persons: older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in serious form. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of disease in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance," thus clarifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact within the framework of social relations, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term "social distance" was understood to mean that people should be totally excluded from society rather than remain in contact with other people in alternative ways; some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, you were advised to have sex only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and you are certain that he has no virus or symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for home-based self-exclusion.
Health-care institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation, and many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas should be quarantined themselves.
Persons at high risk were ordered to be severely quarantined.
Persons who may have been in contact with contaminated COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to control the outbreak include controlling, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is designed to trace and isolate the infected and includes other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The eradication of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the control effort to control the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the levelling of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-exclusion; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and abolishing mass events; community involvement in facilitating and participating in such measures; and environmental protection, such as surface cleaning, after the severity of the outbreak became apparent in China, stronger actions were taken to contain outbreaks, such as isolation of entire cities and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a warning system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to those infected who were in self-insulation and imposed heavy fines on those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and fines have been imposed on the accumulation of excess medical supplies, and models for the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that there are serious problems with regard to mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
Optimal policies to mitigate the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Repression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), otherwise the spread of the disease will soon resume when measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
Antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment do not exist at this time, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Accepting receptor-free cold medication, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, injecting fluids and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for treatment of other virus diseases are also being considered for use in COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some "traditional and domestic funds" could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and the adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the main response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health-care services to facilitate the redistribution of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-emergency procedures, where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the expansion of intensive care through training of staff and increased availability of IVL and beds.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection could have occurred - the so-called zero patient.
The first known case of new coronavirus infection probably occurred on 1 December 2019 in Huhan Province of Hubei, China.
The number of cases of coronavirus infection in Hubei province gradually increased during the month.
They were mainly associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one of the theories was that the virus had infiltrated the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus was of zoonosic origin. On 26 December, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was recorded at the Hubei provincial clinic by Dr. Zhang Tianjin, who reported the case to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Ouhan City on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors from the central clinic in Ouhan warned her colleagues about "coronavirus similar to SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police that they were responsible for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, Ai Feng, received a reprimand from her superiors for causing panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases of unknown pneumonia was reported to the health authorities, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January; the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, thanks to the Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to more recent official data, 6,174 people already had symptoms by 20 January 2020; as at 26 March, the United States had outstripped China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world; as at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories recorded at least one reported case of contamination.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory stay at home, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As at 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million were isolated in the Philippines, some 59 million were isolated in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure rose to 2.6 billion - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Ouhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, which was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixiang was working on a case of unknown type of mass pneumonia, which on 27 December her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Wuhan.
Initial genetic testing of patients on 27 December 2019 revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Uhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police alerted doctors in Ouhan to the responsibility for "promotion of rumours" of the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the ability of the newly discovered virus to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later called the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, a "people's war."
The events of "the largest quarantine in the history of mankind" began to unfold, on 23 January, a health cordon was announced and a ban on entry into and from Ouhan, later extended to a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubei, affecting a total of some 57 million people.
The city has been banned from using personal transport.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was built to receive other incoming patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other facilities in Ouhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travellers and extending the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have imposed a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions have been imposed on Hubei and beyond.
The schedule of public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, the movement of citizens was controlled, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (over half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on movement in the open air, after the outbreak had entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
In Beijing, for example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine had been imposed on all international travellers entering the city; as at 23 March, there had been only one case of internal transmission in mainland China, five days earlier, from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of cases of internal transmission had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Ouhan, were lifted, two months after the province was quarantined. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, and no exact time frame was given for the lifting of the order.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for a visa from Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided monetary stimulus packages to companies. On 4 April, at 10 a.m., a national three-minute "minute silence" opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus declared by the National Council of State, which coincided with the Qinmin holiday, but the central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, respecting physical distance in order to avoid the recurrence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, largely because a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji had gathered in Daegu.
Shinchonji's followers arrived in Daegu from Ouhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 of the 9,336 church followers (approximately 13 per cent) had reported symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, an increase to 3,150 as of 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were tested to confirm the existence of the virus.
The outbreak had affected the number of travels, and the flight schedule of airlines had been changed, and South Korea had launched a programme to screen the population for the presence of the virus, monitor contacts and establish quarantine measures for contact persons, which was considered the largest and best organization in the world.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of symptoms through a mobile application by all those coming from abroad, extensive testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the following day, and increased testing capabilities, allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities were not isolated there, and South Korea's society was initially divided by President Moon Jae In's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either praising the President or calling for impeachment on Mr. Moon for what they considered to be an inadequate response by the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases per day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, 121 countries sought help in testing for the virus in South Korea.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sports activities, Friday prayers and the closure of universities, universities and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani announced on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit inter-urban travel, but intensive urban movement in front of Persian New Year continued.
The Shiite shrines in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 incidents recorded by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reported on 3 March that the results of the virus testing had been positive.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch (Human Rights Watch) called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to release temporarily all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed facilities, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths within one day, the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, Iran had recorded 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death every 10 minutes from coronavirus.
According to the representative of WHO, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had reached Italy when two Chinese tourists had positive results on SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The number of cases of infection has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law on the containment of the outbreak, which placed more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy under quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté said, "The entry into and exit from the outbreak area will be blocked.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend businesses and cancel sports activities." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already died in Italy at that time.
All major sports events, including series A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sports events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conté ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies.

As at 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery in Italy, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report noted that this high mortality rate in Italy could be facilitated by a combination of two factors: the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the inability to examine all those who are currently sick with coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus in the most peaceful manner in all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the slow and serious response to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-priority travel and social contacts be avoided, inviting people to work from the home whenever possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than Pound2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distance measures, prohibiting the gathering of more than two people and restricting outdoor travel and active rest only to cases of extreme need.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, fines and crowding.
Most of the enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of those that provide "life for the population," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, shops, petrol stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading public health organization of the U.S. government, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, the testing of the population in the United States was not immediately initiated and the true scale of the outbreak of the disease during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the failure of the Federal Government until the end of February to authorize the use of non-State test kits developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, and the restrictive criteria before the beginning of March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done on the basis of the appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.
On 22 March, Associated Press reported that "many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, were waiting for their turn to be tested for hours or days." Following a report from Washington State on 29 February of the first death from coronavirus in the United States, Governor Jay Insley declared a state of emergency, which was also soon proclaimed by other states.
On 3 March, Seattle schools were cancelled and, by mid-March, schools were closed throughout the country. On 6 March 2020, a group of Imperial College epidemiologists, London, informed the United States of the projected impact of the new coronavirus on the country.

On April 3, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In New York state, as of 3 April, the number of cases exceeded 100,000, and the White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring public access information through the office of Vice-President Mike Pens, through public statements and publications of health officials and scientists related to the virus.
Overall, President Trump ' s supporters were divided as to how successful he was in coping with the crisis.
Some officials and observers criticized US dependence on imports of essential materials, including essential items, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict models of the spread of the disease.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travellers from Ouhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was identified as the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its new coronavirus contingency plan (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border control and communication in a threat situation.
A human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia on 21 March.

Prior to the flight, a medical check-up of passengers was conducted and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans with negative tests for coronavirus were evacuated.
The tests were taken from all South African nationals, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers participating in the humanitarian mission, and they remained under surveillance and quarantine for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precautionary measure.

Spain, for example, withdrew 58,000 Chinese sets for coronavirus testing, providing a precision of only 30 per cent, while the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 married Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but subsequently they appeared to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of infection.
WHO noted a clear difference between the situation with the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004, in which Chinese authorities were accused of classified information, which allegedly prevented prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, in which the central Government "routinely provided updated information on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a travel ban on transport in Ouhana, the WHO representative, Goden Galea, noted that although "this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO," it was also "a very important indication of the fulfilment of the obligation to contain the epidemic at the most common location" and described it as "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of the ability of the infection to pass from person to person outside China and of the increase in the number of infected countries, WHO declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC), the situation being the sixth since 2009, when it was first used during a swine influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the PHEIC announcement was due to "a global proliferation crisis, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international movement and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement."
On 5 February, WHO requested the global community to provide $675 million for strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to those countries that "have no systems in place to identify people infected with the virus, even though the epidemic has not yet reached those countries."
Mr. Tedros also stated that "the state of our preparedness is the level of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link" and called on the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay in the future." At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire UN system in response to the problem."
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Team has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will make it possible "to focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to control the outbreak of the disease in a broader social and economic context."
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint ad hoc team that provided international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in addressing the situation within the country and assessing the "seriousness of the disease and its infection," organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, as well as field visits to assess "the effectiveness of provincial and district responses, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that "it is too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so."
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of a global spread of coronavirus would be raised from "high" to "very high," the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: "This is the test of every government on the planet's readiness for a real state of affairs: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready for it, and you also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the worst scenario.
Ryan also stated that current data did not justify declaring the global pandemic public health officials, and added that the declaration of the pandemic would mean that "we essentially recognize that every human being on the planet will be at risk of contracting the virus."
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of a pandemic coronavirus.
The Director-General of WHO said that WHO was "deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue." WHO was seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a reaction to the situation, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, Director-General of WHO, had been requested to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to be subjected to life-saving measures and that it was the responsibility of the Government to organize such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other undefined groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to solicit views and provide advice.
The digital node contains information on country-specific policies (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gauve and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their actions in the fight against the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) at the provincial level were dismissed for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these dismissals showed dissatisfaction with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect China's Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak had begun in Ouhan, but took sides in the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had originated in the US or Italy.
US President Donald Trump's administration called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Uhan virus," saying that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation of the virus, which has now become a global pandemic," which in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and "differs from the US President's administration's inability to contain the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast has access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains a communication strategic trick apparently invented by the National Security Council, and there are such references to the strategy: "It's all about China.
We are being asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television performances." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of the "advocacy push" for global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy agency, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a "geopolitic component including the struggle for influence through the PR and the so-called policy of generosity."
Borrell also stated that "China insists on promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the US."
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and, according to some reports, to send assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned by the United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of transferring aid destined for other countries to their own country.
Medical masks have also been the subject of disputes among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL vehicles destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of European Union support for the coronavirus-covered Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that "it was China alone that responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not reflect European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté of Italy, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the dispatch to Italy of Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfectant transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source," claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "unhelpful or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favourable impression on world public opinion at the "geopolitic and diplomatic" level.
The President of Lombardia Attilio Fontana and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin's Press Secretary, Dmitri Peskov, stated that "in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rates, they will also be able to respond when needed."
The NATO Defence Exercise 2020, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries - the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war - will be conducted in a reduced format.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, criticized the Defence 2020 exercise: "In today's public health crisis, these exercises endanger the lives not only of the U.S. military and many European participating countries, but also of the people of the countries where such events are to take place." The Iranian Government has suffered greatly from the virus, with about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as 15 other current or former politicians.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for assistance, informing him that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets because of the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic had led to calls for the adoption of social policies in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave and increased funding for public health.
Political scientists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan's "unsignable and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine facility in a government designated location.
South Korean society was originally divided by President Moon Jae-ing's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either praising the actions of the President or calling for impeachment by Mr. Moon for what they considered to be an inadequate response by the Government to the outbreak of the disease, and the Pandemic forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, the Parliament voted in favour of giving Prime Minister Victor Orban the right to govern indefinitely by decree, to suspend the work of Parliament, and to hold elections and punish those accused of spreading false information about the virus and government measures to deal with the crisis.
The outbreak of coronavirus was cited as the cause of several shortages of supplies due to the global increase in the use of anti-emergence equipment, the purchase of products in panic conditions and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier failures.
Panic purchases have also taken place in several locations; this has resulted in the loss of basic commodities, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, from store shelves, which in turn has led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedroz Adanoma, the demand for personal protection equipment has increased 100fold.
This surge resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices over the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection throughout the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will therefore be at risk.
In Australia, owing to the pandemic, Daigoo buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have resulted in a shortage of infant food in some supermarkets and have subsequently been banned by the Australian Government; despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Ouhan region, as well as high food demand, severe food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and trafficking in critical products, which have proved successful, have avoided the acute food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry believes that agricultural prices may rise.
Food shelves remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure the nutritional status of the population.
Similar laws require food producers to keep food supplies in case of emergency exist in Italy.
China suffered damage to the world economy: according to media reports of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, which reduced retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Mainland China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, a virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agatha Demarai, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in markets is expected to persist until there is a clearer understanding of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outperform the effects of the 2002 - 2004 SARS epidemic.
One assessment made by an expert from the University of Washington, D.C., in St. Louis is that the damage to the global supply chain may exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact may last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take "urgent action" following a sharp fall in oil prices due to the fall in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed because of a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Daw Jones Index for industrial companies, showed the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Doe index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The stocks fell again because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights because of the sharp decline in demand for air travel, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of China's New Year's celebrations.
A number of large-scale events, including annual New Year festivals, have been cancelled by national and regional Governments; private companies have also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the New Year ' s events were cancelled and tourist attractions closed to prevent mass crowds; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were cancelled.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holidays until 10 February, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and canceling the New Year's celebration, and the retail sector suffered on a global scale: shop hours were reduced and some shops were temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, attendance at shopping centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of visitor temperature testing equipment and cancellation of activities; according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession in Latin America may leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would have been the case in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of the Uhan epidemic, China lost about 5 million jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers found themselves in their country ' s provinces or trapped in Hubei province; in March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought the Government ' s help.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, a coronavirus outbreak can kill 47 million people and unemployment rates can reach 32 per cent.The self-insulation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44 per cent of Canadian households had been unemployed in one way or another. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost their jobs since the introduction of severe isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit; almost half a million companies in Germany moved their employees to a government-subsidized reduced part-time work schedule.
The German part-time wage scheme has also been introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected organizations as well as individuals, whether formally employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often publicly funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public and, where possible, supporting the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed indefinitely around the world, or access to them had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or postponed.
In return, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered setbacks, and the Vatican announced the cancellation of the Good Week events in Rome, which are held during the last week of the Christian penitent period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses encourage older Christians to stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders have offered to conduct outdoor worship.
The Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapel and square of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims no longer appeared, and later other religious organizations also abolished worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwahr.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the lifting of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of coronavirus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from entering the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 League, the Premier League 2019-20, the Euro-2020 UEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "for the period beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gambling institutions around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or cancelled.
This has resulted in many players moving online and many gambling sites reporting a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also cancelled all their plays.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have started to explore ways to continue their activities and share their results over the Internet, to organize live webcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There are many Internet memes on the subject of coronavirus online, many of which are humorous and allay the anxiety that characterizes periods of uncertainty.
Since the inception of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as against people from hot spots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February news reports (when most cases of infection were still limited to China) recorded racist sentiments in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received just retribution for anything.
Some African countries are also experiencing an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Ouhanya and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in areas affected by the virus, were supported in both offline and online settings.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, notably Italy, the first in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition urging that Chinese nationals be prohibited from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChinanNeverComeJapan) held a leading position on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Uhan to New Sanjara.
Students coming from north-eastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India reported cases of persecution associated with the outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, claimed that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta later condemned them as "misleading." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have re-emerged because of the pandemic: foreigners have become known as "foreign garbage" and "recyclables."
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made public their scientific articles on the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognizes the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and only designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have experienced the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated at the hospital, or none at all.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of this test.
As of March 2020, because of the limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
By using a polymerase chain reaction of real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from respiratory tracts obtained in various ways, including nasal swabs or a wet sample.
Results are usually available for several hours to two days.
The OT-PCR test, which was carried out with swabs taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, however, continuing to reproduce in the lungs.
For infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, lower respiratory tract material may be taken as an alternative by sucking catheter, or coughing products (mocrot) can be used.
One of the early tests of the PCR was developed at Charita Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PowerChek Coronavirus.
It identifies the "E" gene common to all beta coronavirus and the "RdRp" gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to be authorized by China's National Drug Administration to use the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit on the basis of the PCR. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel through the International Reagent Resource for real-time RRT-PCD (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) at public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test sets gave incomplete results due to the faulty reagents and the narrow test area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency use permit, and the U.S. Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 based on the RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been reported; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology, "VECTOR."
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered with the Federal Health Supervisory Service and it was reported that, on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use a test that could be performed for 3.5 hours for a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for Abbott m2000 tests; previously the FDA issued such a permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test of about 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses an amplification technology in place of the PCR for insulated nucleic acids.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of variable temperatures, this method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibody test that specifically links to a new coronavirus nucleocapse protein (N protein), and it is hoped that results will be available in 15-20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that "the thorax X-rays have little early diagnostic value, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms appear."
Typical signs identified in CT include bilateral multi-duration sub-pleural thrusts of "mat-glass"-type compaction with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.
Sub-pleural domination, the symptom of the boulder bridge and consolidation are evolving as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Ouhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a test method for the first line in COVID-19 diagnosis." As of March 2020, the CCD recommended using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to conduct population control. The analyses can be performed at central laboratories (CLT) or by local diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by puncture of the skin.
Unlike the PCR methods, the blood sampling stage for test analysis is not required. On 26 March 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have completed all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, FDA had approved only one emergency use permit test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits to use their test sets, which can be detected in blood samples of IgG and IgA that have the ability to control the virus.
The test output is several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the virus RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection, and in early April, Britain discovered that none of the antibody test kits it acquired was satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme was developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: "Emergency staff pass a sample test tube to the patient," the patient spit in it, gives back and receives the test results after a while. British NHS announced the launch of its pilot home-based suspicious testing scheme, which eliminates the patient's risk of contracting other patients to the clinic, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. In an express test at COVID-19 in suspicious cases, the medical officer takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors stated that it was ready to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and the week before they could do only 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is ordered by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it had been proposed to conduct rapid testing in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was not known, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 SARS-CoV-2 tests had been carried out, up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 (6.9 per cent) had been positive. Researchers at Israeli Technical and Rambam Hospital clinics developed and tested a method for simultaneously testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and performing further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Ouhan, on 5 February 2020, BGI opened an interim laboratory covering 2,000 square metres of emergency detection called Huo-Yan (in Chinese or Fire Eye), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and completed in only five days; the simulation showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
Following the opening of the laboratory in Ouhan, the laboratories of Huo-yang in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplex schemes were released for the Origami Assays, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests on COVID19, using only 93 samples.
By March, due to lack of and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors referred to test sample processing protocols, which provided for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) within 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the coronavirus test currently being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita exceeded that of any other country and that most of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to rapid testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of mass testing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (established by their emergency detection laboratories in China for Huo-Yan).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCD tests per day and is the world ' s first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside China.
Various test options targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of testing kits that are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by United States health and epidemiological centres was not available until January 28, resulting in a lack of test kits in the US; at the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test sets, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide a sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, however, experts argue that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean Government has worked to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increasing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overburdened and supplies for swabbing and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "deficiencies," and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, a Chinese firm, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that inaccuracies could be due to poor sampling or misuse of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw the inaccurate sets and replace them with other sets, the Shenzhen Bioeasy. Eighty per cent of the test sets that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had failed. The 1.2 million test sets that Slovakia had acquired in China were also found inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that they should be dropped into the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test sets purchased in China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "did not use them." The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test sets in China, but in early April 2020 it declared these sets unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for persons whose tests were positive at SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of persons with whom such patients were in contact, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where COVID-19 died for the first time in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing for the entire population of about 3,400, at an interval of about ten days.
About half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been far less intense than in other developed countries, and extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops have not been imposed.
Many activities there were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but the schools ending on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions have been less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out than in the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without mass testing resources, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results of COVID-19 tests to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.
Seven of these 16 testing laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the "% of positive results" column depends on the testing policy adopted in the country.
A country where only hospital patients are tested will have a higher positive impact than a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under the same conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is a hand-cleaning process to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by faecal or oral means.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or a common cold, for example, if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous sheaths) with his unwashed hands.
Five critical points during the day, followed by washing hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing a child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the procedures for caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the bathroom.
After sniffing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Hand health care refers to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to purge the hands of pathogens (bacterium, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing disease), as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
As well as reducing infant mortality in domestic childbirth.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing could lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits such as hand washing and soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the use of hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea by about one third, comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48 per cent reduction in the number of cases of diarrhoea can be associated with washing hands with soap, and washing hands with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (SARs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the leading cause of under-five mortality, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill almost 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after eating can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea almost by half, and mortality from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Handwashing also prevents the emergence of impetigo - a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A slight negative effect of hand washing is that it can lead to skin drying and, by implication, to skin damage.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too much hand washing can lead to a zud and aptitude of skin - a disease known as eczema or arm dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too much hand washing can also be considered a symptom of OCD.
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal or oral transmission of the disease: after emptiness (leaking, defecation), after washing the child's buttocks (dressing), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or snorting, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the garbage.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is quite limited.
A study on hand washing, conducted in 54 countries in 2015, showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families had a hand washing with soap as a common practice. The 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest 97 per cent; the United States was closer to the middle, with 77 per cent; China had the lowest 23 per cent; and there were several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.
The Emergency Health Care Programme, implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines, is an example of extensive interventions to improve child health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of fluorine teeth.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or detergent is added during washing.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, as fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are poorly dissolved in water.
Adequate quantities of water, however, contribute to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may fall upon it in previous use.
A small amount of research into the skin cover of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests that there is little likelihood of such contamination, as bacteria are washed away from the foam.
The CDC still argues that "a liquid soap with a manual dosage is the preferred handwashing option."
Anti-bacterial soap is actively promoted in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant agents has selective effects on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosene, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selective in relation to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with that advertised.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection devices, complex compounds may contain acids (acoustic, ascorbinic, dairy) as a control device for pH, as well as anti-microbial active benzoic acid and other pillows (aeroe faith, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health has shown that simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soaps containing triclosans in preventing disease and removing bacteria from their hands.
Hot water, comfortable for human skin, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria are multiplied much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm soap water is more effective than cold water.
Contrary to the prevailing view, scientific research has shown that the use of warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant (sanitaser) or hand antiseptic is a waterless hand hygiene device.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products became popular (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptics for arm disinfection or sanitizer).
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, with the addition of cuffs such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) as gel, or humidizers such as glycerine in liquid or foam form, which make it easier to use these products and reduce the effects of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases anti-microbial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcoholic disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis stick, as well as certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhiniruse, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a 3.5 reduction logarithm similar to 35 decibels) on their hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% 99.999 per cent of bacteria (a 4-5 reduction logarithm) on their hands 1 minute after use.
Alcohol-based deinfectants are virtually ineffective against Norwalk-type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use sufficient antiseptics or alcohol-containing drugs to thoroughly treat and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and back surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers over the whole length, shall be rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be carefully washed. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing hand washing rather than disinfectants, especially when hands are heavily contaminated.
The increased popularity of such disinfectants is due to their simple use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for the full washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants may cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain mitigating agents and/or skin humidifiers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and (or) other mitigating substances to the substance.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing mitigating agents caused significantly less irritation and dry skin than soap or anti-microbial detergent.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact nettle syndrome, or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of annoying contact dermatitis became a factor in favour of the choice of disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, water-free products do not clean the hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic micro-organisms as conventional soap and water, since pathogenic micro-organisms are still in their hands.
The efficiency of the disinfectant for alcohol-free hands depends to a large extent on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than in alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
Most recently, it has been proven that the drugs using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative anti-microbial activity, as opposed to alcohol, which has been proven to lose efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive side skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One of the problems with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as it produces a alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend the use of hand washing techniques, which include the following steps:
Spray your hands under warm or cold running water.
Precise water is recommended because standing water can be polluted, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands with lots of soap, including the back of your hands, and areas between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just water), people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Tear your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps remove the germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more the germs are removed.
Spray your hands carefully under the running water.
Rinsing hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to contaminate, and the most common areas are left unattended, such as the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Artificial fingernails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wetting lotion be used to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways to wash hands: pouring water out of a hanging jerricans or bottled pumpkin with holes done and (or) using ash, if necessary, as in developing countries; water-saving solutions such as foot-crackers and other low-cost options exist in places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries).
A crane with a foot pedal is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended on the rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water on the hands and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The increasing amount of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, sponsored a European symposium on paper napkins and towels; the study was aimed at comparing the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow of air dryers for hands.
After washing and drying of hands in a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger cushions was found to increase by an average of 194 per cent and on the palms by 254 per cent.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the airflow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger cushions increases by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger cushions is on average reduced to 76% and on the palms to 77%.
A jet-air dryer that emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h) is capable of blowing micro-organisms from its hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other toilet and toilet users within a radius of up to 2 m.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 m from the dryer.
With the use of paper towels, there was no significant incidence of micro-organisms. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of hand drying.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria, depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand-cleaning using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative solution to travel without soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical method of hand washing became mandatory long after Ignac Zemmelweiss, a Hungarian doctor, found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of inpatient diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce infection.
The medical washing of hands lasts at least 15 seconds and a large amount of soap, water, or gel is used to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbing their fingers against each other.
If there's dirt under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to clean them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used to close the tap and, if necessary, close and open any doors.
This avoids re-polluting the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most health facilities: many doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other elementary procedures can reduce the incidence of catheter-related haemorrhage by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a leaflet showing the standard hand washing and processing procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The review was co-authored by Whitby.
Commercial devices may be used to measure and verify hand hygiene if compliance with regulatory requirements is required.
The World Health Organization refers to "five points" when it is necessary to wash hands:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
before using antiseptics, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to handwashing (medical or anti-microbial soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in a highly antibiotic-resistant environment. For the "cleaning" of the hands before surgery, a crane that can be switched on and off without touching its hands is required; and a little chlorhexidine or iodine water should also be used to lacate the hands, sterile hand drying towels after washing, a sterile friction brush and another sterile cleaning tool under the fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires hand-washing and pre-cooling to the elbow, usually for two to six minutes.
There's no need to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During the striping, the water with the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
Once the washing has been completed, the hands are dried with sterile tissue and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is best to wash hands or use antiseptics before and after the procedures for caring for a sick person.
In order to combat staphylococcal infections, hospitals found that the first 20 per cent of washing was the most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the washing of anti-bacterial soap, hand washing with conventional soap results in more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. The comparison of hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with anti-bacterial soap, on average 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the handling of hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial pollution by 26% compared to anti-bacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand-washed alcohol solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and the Clostridium diffile dispute.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of interventions in different health facilities.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important tool for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instill the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has handwashing taps, although there are cheap ways to wash hands in such places.
However, lack of hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, not lack of soap or water.
Promotion and promotion of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are needed to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that community-based sanitary surveillance is effective to improve the hygiene situation in lower-middle-income countries, while community marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promotion of hand washing in schools is the United Nations Children's Fund's "Tree Star Approach": it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools that encourage washing of hands by students using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By meeting minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-mutters is one of the possible measures taken in the context of awareness-raising campaigns on hand health in order to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children ' s Fund promotes the use of hand-washing emoji.
Some studies examined the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (save years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasimas.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and health-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand health as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, "right handwashing machines " posters were placed next to handwashers in public toilets, as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing hands" means the expression of its unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to participate in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands " when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; this phrase later became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's "Macbeth" play, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands inadvertently in an attempt to purify herself from an imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience in connection with crimes she committed herself and caused her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or observe any unethical act tend to wash their hands more frequently than others, and that handwashers are more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other "clear" compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning: symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual envisaged in many religions, including Baha ' i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Hudhu in Islam, and religions prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam prescribe the obligation to wash their hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
The control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk management depends on the workplace and the workplace, based on an assessment of the risks, the severity of the epidemic in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, incentives for workers to stay at home with signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers who are in contact with the public, for example in schools, in high-density working environments and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic prevention measures, include high-efficiency air filter ventilation, protective shields and accessible personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and morgue personnel who have been in contact with a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are classified as high-risk, with the risk increasing to a very high level when such personnel conduct procedures involving aerosol formation or collect/process samples from a person with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and security equipment, such as pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have different effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible contamination.
Commercial patterns may vary both with respect to the types of goods in demand and the manner in which such goods are purchased (e.g., purchase during non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the vehicle).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The plan for epidemic preparedness and response can be used to organize protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors at home and in communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the controls required to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for and respond to the epidemic may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the targets for responding to the epidemic include reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the disease in the business community.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a widely used framework for occupational safety and health for grouping such tools according to performance.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, engineering and safety equipment are most effective, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering means that staff are isolated from work-risk locations and do not rely on the employee ' s behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or employee.
Personal protection equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the threat to the employee, be of a size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained in proper condition and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) believes that the lowest-risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, respiratory etiquette, including hand-coughing and sneezing, napkin and garbage containers, remote or replacement work readiness, where necessary, guidance for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff members with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until the end of the heat, the absence of elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of stimuli or other symptoms-eliminating drugs, and require flexibility in hospital policies, allowing staff members to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons for whom there is no confirmed evidence or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the business area or the recent travel of such a person to COVID-19 distribution sites.
Such categories include workers who have been in contact with the public, such as schools, high-density workers and some major retailers, and engineering and safety equipment for such groups and groups with higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such groups and higher-risk groups include recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings for virtual communication, replacement schedules, cessation of non-critical visits to COVID-19 distribution sites, development of emergency communication plans, including a forum for responding to questions of concern, provision of relevant training for workers on COVID-19 risk factors and protection measures, training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, proper use of such devices, provision of resources and working environments conducive to personal hygiene, requirement for regular hand-washing, limitation of access to the workplace by clients and the public, provision of information indicators on the need for hand-washing and other protective measures, provision of resources and working environments that are conducive to personalization, lack of COVID-19.
In rare cases, workers from such risk groups may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, the safety of workers and other passengers requires measures such as separating the sick person from others for a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to care for a sick person, providing the sick person with a mask or asking him to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members shall wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
Used gloves and other non-refillable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected; in the case of commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, safety measures include the postponement of travel in the event of illness, self-insulation and the immediate information of the ship ' s medical centre in the event of heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin for such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
Where there is a minimum or average rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as cancellation of exits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical or choir singing, eating in cafeteria, increasing the distance between desks, setting up arrival and care times, restricting non-essential visits, using a separate location of health facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, apart from social distance strategies, long-term non-attendance measures may be considered; for law enforcement officers carrying out daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered to be low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as those prescribed for ambulance paramedics, including the use of suitable personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, employees must clean and disinfect their formal belts and equipment before being reused by household cleaning aerosols or by rubbing, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and to dispose of the personal protective equipment used, as well as to use and wash clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are in contact with patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 contamination.
They have a very high risk of contamination in their aerosol formation procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 contamination.
Aerosol formation procedures include sounding, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and screening or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue workers are those who treat the bodies of people with confirmed illness or suspicion of infection with COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they perform autopsies, they are placed in a very high-risk category; additional engineering equipment for these risk groups includes the use of isolated premises for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in procedures involving aerosol formation.
In some health facilities and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated with the precautions required for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the allocation of incoming patients to separated waiting areas depending on the existence of suspicions of COVID-19 infection. OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as for persons conducting procedures with aerosol formation.
In the U.S., approved NIOSH respirators for a person with an N95 or higher filter need to be used as part of a comprehensive respiratory protection written program that specifies individual selection requirements and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not a physiological fluid.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the receiving point.
Those who collect samples from respiratory tracts in COVID-19 patients or vectors of this disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation are encouraged by WHO to wear a surgical mask, protective glasses or face shield, robes and gloves.
The N95 or FFP2 respirator shall be worn instead of the surgical mask when the aerosol formation is performed.
In view of the lack of personal protection facilities worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized by using remote medicine, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, access to a COVID-19 patient only for those who provide immediate care, the use of only those personal protective equipment required for a specific purpose, the prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, in dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protection equipment, and recommending that no masks be used for persons without symptoms.

THEMA: [Covid-19] Pressure relief and preparation for the future
DATE/WORK OF MANAGEMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
AUTHORIZATIONS: CC0: No protected rights
We live in unusual circumstances this month.
COVID-19 is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen a friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, as reflected in e-mails, calls, and chat rooms - a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunately we have amazing people working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And it's possible because of your work, whether it's to make websites work, pay our colleagues, or protect community security.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and it's more important today than ever before.
At such a time, not only what we do but also how we do it is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting in the coming week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and timetable for the coming days and months.
In the course of our communication, we considered our ideas on how best to respond to the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, you have to do it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
We expect it to be about four hours a day or 20 hours a week before further orders are issued.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether to care for your family, to buy food or to go to a doctor's appointment, your well-being is our priority number one.
We don't keep track of your working hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't be working.
That is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
You don't have to make sick leave or leave: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and schedule to cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, tell Brian from the T&C Ops unit so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to honour obligations to our contractors and employees at an hourly rate.
Each person will be paid according to normal hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll back you up.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, we are talking about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
Such activities should be supported at all times.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (other than others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all entities to assess current objectives and to shift the emphasis to support, which is essential to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we simply focus on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work "two more to catch up" after the end of the pandemic.
You won't need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timetables, as far as possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our plan for 2019-2020, thus allowing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, with a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all those who need or want to work.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions across the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, to brief representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank the APP team for leading this effort.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco might be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a lot of precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all DC staff its COVID-19 rules.
Last week, our office in D.C. completely moved to remote work, following instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work remotely, are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that the duration of meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider splitting them into a course of several days.
Define clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and make available in advance for consultation.
By default, use video communication to facilitate interaction and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point, the person who will monitor the receipt of the questions in the chat room and the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for the maintenance of the notes (or joint survey).
If you need to use a handheld, contact the technical support service by e-mail.
Take advantage of Wellness Reimbursement when you buy snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomics manuals available in webinars format to facilitate the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all grantees of the community to cancel massive Wikimedia-funded activities, such as "editathons," until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the non-implementation of agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such objectives.
In the coming week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general mood in the global community is not only a disappointment at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief due to mutual understanding and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not just.
As far as prospects are concerned, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide a space for the community to monitor exposure and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We're in this situation together, and we're ready to help anything we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such e-mails and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries significantly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, events, key traffic, information coverage or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We stand ready to support and communicate as necessary.
If there are confidentiality problems, contact Brian Judaan, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support one another and to create space for the important work to be done in future weeks and possibly months.
For this to happen, we will need the help of each and every one of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum impact as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensine-cracking enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (s) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the respective angiotensine enzyme (ACE), reducing the angiotensine-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensine-cracking enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal farm located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-bond peptidas domain M2 and the C-Konts transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-passed type I membrane protein and its enzyme active domain reaches the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 ' s in-cell domain is splintered from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as masterdaz, and the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar light-type II cells, thin intestine enterocytes, arterial and veneous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 biosynthesis is also found in the cortex of the brain, the striatum, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE splits the angiotenzin I hormone into the vascular angiotenzin II.
ACE2, in turn, chops off the carboxyl end of the amino acid phenilaline from the angiotenzin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilatator angiotenzine (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also split a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apelin, neurotenzine, dinorphine A and greline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of a transporter of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present during Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus cells, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, binding S1 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 proteins with the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the initialization of the S serine protein of the TMPRSS2 medium, whose inhibition is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to believe that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help to control infection.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulators recommend that standard treatment be continued by APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared with the control group."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients who have received APF inhibitors, who have been exposed to higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the decline in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than for patients with general risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be an innovation in acute lung therapy and appears to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome caused by lipo-polysacharides.
The half-life rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the intolerant nature of classical renin-angiotensine inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensine II is enhanced. The introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Annexes COVID-19 are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the identification of persons ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several applications have been developed to track contacts.
This gave rise to a discussion on confidentiality issues, particularly with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of users of applications.
The softer options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth support functions directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they were in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and Singapore uses an app called TraceToger.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be handed over to the Government. North Macedonia has launched a "StopKorona!" application working on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government announced that the contact tracking application was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, with similar applications planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TraceToger application and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use a geozoning application designed to ensure that COVID-19 patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false reactions and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their coronavirus-related applications to App Store, including only "official" or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
The confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of supervision.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for public projects:
The monitoring should be "legitimate, necessary and proportionate";
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by time-limit clauses;
Use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and evidence of such security provided;
Digital surveillance should prevent instances of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple propose their joint plan to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, web-based location tracking is used instead of applications, which precludes downloading the application and avoiding tracing.
In Israel, web-based tracking was approved.
Network solutions, which have access to location data, also have large potential confidentiality problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers for communications only (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracing information from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and map transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to alert citizens to potential contact with infected persons, but also made information on the location of the public, which was possible because of the significant changes in the information protection legislation that had been introduced following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering both centralized and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been made public.
Tracking contacts that maintain confidentiality is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on decisions that ensure confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized lines with confidentiality (DP-PT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that preserves confidentiality in the collection and use of locational or cross-track data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The platform's work is based on studies published in "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic," published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing confidentiality technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technology to enable users to share confidential data on location and state of health with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global compatibility of applications for tracking and alerting, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to track the movement of people infected with coronavirus, but with data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant surveillance, first implementing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Repositioning a drug (also known as reprofiling, diversion, diversion or therapeutic diversion of drugs) is a reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than that originally foreseen for development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvulsive plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains some 66 proteins, each of which has several liganda binding sites.
Analysis of these connecting sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicasa, S protein and ADF-ribophosphatease.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their pre-clinic study examined several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarities in structure with the most similar approved drugs in order to speed up the development of a high-impact drug against SARS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquin and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied in the clinical "Solidarity" test.
New York Governor Andrew Kuomo announced that testing of chloroquin and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulfate and phosphate chloroquine in accordance with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and was only allowed under EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial schemes.
CDC stated that "the use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish Study Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquin in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York School of Medicine in Langon studies the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Ouhan and Shenzhen have shown that Favipiravier is "samely effective."
For 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the negative result was an average of four days later, while for 45 patients who did not take the drug, the disease lasted 11 days.
In Ouhan, a study was conducted to monitor 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received a favipiravier and the other half received an umyphenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results of the drug's effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug from Japan to replenish its stocks and that it would use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed Trump's administration about the possibility of purchasing a drug. The drug may be less effective in neglected cases.
It may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
One study on a combination of Lopinavire and Ritonavir antiviral drugs (Kaletra) concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been detected."
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding proteasis.
A group of researchers from Colorado University are trying to modify drugs to find a connection to SARS-CoV-2 protease. The scientific community is critical of the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically designed for HIV and AIDS treatment.
WHO has included the combination of lopinavire and retonavire in the international test of Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections, and later Gilead Sciences found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro for many filo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronavirus.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies have shown that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one carried out on moderate patients and the other on more severe patients.
Three injecting vitamin C clinical trials are currently under way for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing antibiotic azitromicin.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonida) Taejin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for use in treatment of pre-symptomic patients infected with new coronavirus.
Phase II, forms of angiotensine-translating enzyme 2, is tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of kolchicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with low COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 were invited with light symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and not using effective contraceptive methods are not allowed to participate in the study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which prompted the Italian Drug Administration to publish recommendations for the use of the drug.
On April 14, a multi-centre study with 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the reprofiling of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and the Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umiphenovir: Umiphenovir was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially suitable for use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilisumab (anti-IL6 receptor): approved in China.
Also testing in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been clinically tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect an SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available in 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates conducted phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the required speed, production capacity, large deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technological platforms were under study and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovyrus vector type 5)
CEPI scientists reported in April that 115 potential vaccines were in the early stages of development, 78 of which were used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 candidate vaccines had been declared, but little information was available (presumably in the planning or development phase).
Phases I to II carry out pre-safety and immunogenic testing, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and on several sites, with simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the test usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the drugs are tested for prevention effectiveness while at the same time tracking side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested in humans (the pre-clining phase is still under way).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune responses.
On January 24, 2020, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac), Canada, announced the launch of its own vaccine to begin human testing in 2021.
The start of vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitmeiker, announced that they would start working on their vaccine.
Janssen, together with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, is developing an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
OncoGen's laboratory in Romania published a document on 8 February 2020 on the development of a vaccine similar to the one used for vaccination against neoantigen cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the start of testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate drug that could be tested in humans in 90 days.

To develop and produce a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for pre-clining tests and a stage I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop the vaccine, even on an accelerated basis.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported that with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a coronavirus-like particle.
The potential vaccine is being tested in the laboratory and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large amounts of money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an IRNS-based vaccine.

On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Pandemic Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the development of COVID-19 vaccine, with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different animal vaccine candidates.
Imperial College researchers, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-implicit COVID-19 RNA vaccine.
The candidate drug for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
Around the same time, the Canadian Government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as plans for a national vaccine bank that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, saying that "MNA had introduced SARS-CoV-2 S1 sub-unit vaccines, triggering strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, Waterloo University's Canadian Pharmaceutical School announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine that may be produced in the form of nasal spray.
DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and generate harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to the prevention properties.
Another randomized study, conducted in Australia, involves 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterised by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, point to the need for measures to control infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as for international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines for SARS that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that had been conducted at that time could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one DNA-based MERS vaccine that passed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all virus-based vaccines under development, two adenovirous vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
There was a conspiracy theory on social media that claimed that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all and that the vaccine against it already existed.
Publications on social media quoted the words of some patients who claimed to have patents on genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
The coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases are light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is transmitted to viral pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had been killed by the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread through close contact between people, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat to the ground or to the surface, but are not transmitted over long distances of air.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then with their eyes, noses or mouths.
The virus can live for 72 hours on the surface.
It is most contagious within the first three days of symptoms, although it may be possible to spread both before symptoms appear and at later stages. Standard diagnostic method is a polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nosal swab swab.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspicion of illness, as well as to carers.
The recommendations on the use of health masks vary from one department to another, with some agencies recommending that they should not be used at all, some recommending their use and others requiring their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local prevalence was recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling of depression in the chest, confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, blueness of face or lips; if the symptoms mentioned above are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tracts, such as sneezing, sniffing, or throat pain, may be less common.
Also, various percentages show stomach and intestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some of the cases recorded in China were initially limited to a feeling of chest pressure and a high heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress into pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually death.
It's called an incubation period.
The incubation period COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of the population, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and it is reported that the symptoms do not occur in all infected persons.
The role of such non-symptomic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with the unsymptomic current of the disease is currently unknown and is only being studied; the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that in 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was unsympathetic.
China ' s National Health Commission has begun to include non-symptomic cases in its daily report since 1 April; of the 166 cases recorded on that day, 130 (78 per cent) had been rejected as unsymptomic at the time of testing.
Both wet and saliva can have a large concentration of the virus.
When you speak loudly, you get more drops in the air than when you talk loudly.
A study carried out in Singapore showed that drops can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) when the cough is open.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission of particles of the virus was still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the human rooms revealed the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac reanimation (CPR), may cause exhalation products to spray and thus spread the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through faeces, but the risk is considered low; the virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is low.
European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) staff claim that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects two or three other people. The virus can survive on the surface from hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be capable of living on a cardboard surface for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces for up to 4 hours.
These values, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent, if used correctly, have a very useful effect in controlling contamination: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it and can remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconychloride and chlorohexide gluconate (surgery disinfectant), are less effective against the virus.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, while in the sixth patient, the highest levels of the virus in the blood were detected on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome found for the first time in three people with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Ouhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in natural coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens up its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to SARS-CoV's original.
The lungs are the organ most exposed to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates host cells through the angiotensine-cracking enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in alveolar cells of light type II.
The virus connects with ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, the "spice" (peplomer).
Twelve per cent of infected people admitted to the hospital in Ouhan have been diagnosed with acute damage to myocardium, which is more common in a severe form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammation response and immune system disorders observed during the progress of the disease, but acute damage to myocardium may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 recipes are present in the heart in large quantities because they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombole (25%) was observed in patients who were in I.T.T. with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse projections. The autopsy of COVID-19 patients showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocytoid infiltrators in their lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism towards ACE2-expressive epithelial respiratory cells, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hyper-inflammation.
In particular, it has been found that the GM-CSF pathogenic T cells are correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 inflammable monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy also revealed lymphocytic infiltrations.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for this disease.
A linear real-time chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained from the nasal scapula, but a nose or wet sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks intervals, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate the strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCD) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests, which could have detected current infections as well as possible past infections, were under development but were not yet widespread.
The Chinese experience with the results of the tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use at the end of this month.
Bilateral multi-duration sub-pleural thrusts of compaction by type of "matal glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-pleural domination, the symptom of a boulder bridge (long-drinking of the Alveolar variable partition) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination carried out during the autopsy are:
Macroscopium: pleurith, pericarditis, compaction and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light form of pneumonia: lung edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudat.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (PRDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Respiratory pneumonia: organization of exudats in alveolar cavities and lung interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intravascular clotting (DVD syndrome); leukoertroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing the rules of respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, noses or mouths with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inside of the elbow of the arm.
After coughing or sneezing, a good hand hygiene procedure is recommended.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by people with no sympathetic disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens and eliminated major public events.
Remote guidance also implies that people must be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no effective drugs against COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected to be completed before 2021, the bulk of the anti-COVID-19 response is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as "Plateau Release."
The CDC also recommends that hands with soap and water be washed more frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or when the hands are heavily polluted, before eating and after sniffing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of disinfectant alcohol (at least 60% alcohol content) for hand-processing, but only when soap and water are not available; regions where such disinfectants are not sold are provided by WHO with two recipes for local production.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with anti-microbial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not an appropriate antiseptic arm treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and other damaged vital organs.
CDC recommends that those who suspect that they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
In order to strengthen immunity, personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets are recommended.
Supportive therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., intensive care physicians and pulmonaries compiled the therapeutic advice of various institutions in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In order to treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health workers recommend that paracetamol (acetaminophene) be chosen over ibuprofen.
Care should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health facilities, when conducting procedures that may result in air-capple emissions, such as intubation or hand drying.
CDC recommends that health workers who care for people with COVID-19 should be placed in the Air Capables Facility (AIIR), an additional measure in addition to standard precautions in terms of contact and air. CDC published recommendations on the use of Personal Protection (SID) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection equipment and medical gloves; of the above, the use of respirators rather than medical masks is preferable.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency use permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but if not instructed, protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, the manufacture of masks on their own at home.
In most cases, COVID-19 is not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalised patients with respiratory deficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a nose oxygen cannul with intense air flow or two-tier positive pressure in the respiratory tracts.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods are as effective for patients in critical condition as the IVL.
Invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs is chosen by some doctors if it is available, as it significantly restricts the spread of particles in the air compared to a nose cannul with intense air flow, and the risk of a severe form of disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and health-care resources are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 percent of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The challenge of artificial ventilation of the lungs is becoming more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed under COVID-19 and oxygenation are becoming increasingly problematic.
An IVL with inhaled pressure and a VWP is necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimum ventilation damage that may result in pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, high VWPs may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
Volunteers recommended by WHO are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconvulsive plasma as an experimental treatment when a person ' s life is at risk or imminent risk.
It has not been subjected to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to control the outbreak of the disease.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect "near contact" with observational data and therefore determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-insulation but also sends a notice to local health authorities: Big data analysis collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence - such tools are used to track infected people and individuals with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track data from mobile phones of people believed to be infected with coronavirus.
Quarantine and protection measures have been taken for persons who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, with a view to researching and preventing the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute provided aggregate data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to detect quarantine offenders.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Giulio Gallera, reported that cell network operators reported that "40 per cent of people still move around."
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: "Increased social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may occur in a light form, with little or no symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as a common cold.
Patients with a mild form of disease tend to recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may require between three and six weeks to be treated.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of obtaining severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although similar data for COVID-19 are not available. Some COVID-19 may cause lungs and pneumonia as a complication.
In the most severely affected population, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorganic deficiency.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
Trombo-education anomalies, especially the increase in protrombie time, were described in 6 per cent of patients admitted to the COVID-19 hospital, while kidney disorders were observed in 4 per cent of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early case studies, the average time from the initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
Post-mortem post-mortem studies indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromicsoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes showed viral cytopatic changes.
The appearance of the lung was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (PRDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were related to troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospital patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to status due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
The lack of efficient and easy counting of cases could lead to higher mortality rates.
Nevertheless, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that current mortality rates are underestimated.
In general, serious COVID-19 symptoms were 1.4 times more common among smokers, and such patients were about 2.4 times more likely to be in need of intensive care or to die than non-smokers; concerns were expressed about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had their lungs reduced by 20-30% and their scans revealed injuries.
After recovery, it can also lead to "after intensive care" syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovering from the virus had a permanent immunity against it.
Based on the flow of other coronavirus, this is considered likely, but there have also been reported cases where, after recovery from COVID-19, coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been a prolonged period of infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be natural, of animal origin and an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, describes 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case.
According to official figures published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to region and time of spread, and are also influenced by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatments used, the time of the outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency care codes: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to infections is divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections was 6.9 per cent (153,822/2,240 191).
Some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the transmitted infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and not diagnosed) who died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the moment of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies shows how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower mortality rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, based on blood donors.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies carried out in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The group most at risk is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women has narrowed only since the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women, the associated diseases among men (e.g. hypertension experienced by men at younger ages than among women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and OIE have different gender statistics.
Most health-care workers, especially nurses, are therefore women, who are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adane Gebreisus, explains: "CO" means "coron," "VI" means "virus," "D" means "disease," and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a particular geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or human groups, as required by international name recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "Cornavirus" and "Hunk Crownavirus."
In January 2020, in line with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms "strict respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCoV" as temporary names of virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published.
Owing to the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as nose swabs, as well as parts of IVL machines.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, when one of the local plants was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the outbreak of COVID-19 first broke out, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fake information about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects became rapidly available on the Internet.
People may be infected with other animals.
Research has not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
So far, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or medicines for its treatment.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are currently being carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test), which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing compounds considered most effective to date.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells using ACE2 receptors, so scientific developments use the results of previous SARS-CoV studies.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virio vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is designed to trigger a rapid immune response of the human body to the new infection COVID-19.
The second strategy, the creation of a sub-unit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is aimed at destroying the S-swipe protein, which helps the virus penetrate the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, new vaccine methodology).
The experimental vaccines developed under either of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of antiviral drugs is a major part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III remediation studies had been carried out in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 had been carried out, as were several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquin and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavire/ritonavir, and lopinavire/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, FDA issued emergency use permits for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.The Chinese regulations of 7th edition also specify interferon, ribavirin or umyphenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high Ribavirin doses are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for detailed study in vivo, demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor requires the serina 2 transmembrane protease protein (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azitromicin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in COVID-19 treatment is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication at late stages of severe shape COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemia properties, and a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China has included a tocilysumab in the recommendation for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug reached the second stage of an unrandomized test conducted at the national level in Italy after positive results were obtained in patients with severe disease.
Combined with a blood serum analysis on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA approved antagonist interleukin-6 receptor based on historical case studies to treat steroid refracture cytokines release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilysumab is an effective treatment for cytokin release syndrome.
The transmission of treated and concentrated antibodies generated by the immune systems of COVID-19 patients to people who need them is now regarded as a non-vaccinational passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested in SARS treatment, but the results have not been convincing.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, it is possible to use other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvulsive blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of cured patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
