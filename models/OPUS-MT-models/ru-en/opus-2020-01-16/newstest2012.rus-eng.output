Parliament does not support the amendment to allow Timoshenko ' s freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal an article condemning the leader of the opposition, Yulia Timoshenko.
An amendment that would result in the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years ' imprisonment for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be unfavourable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will hear Timoshenko ' s appeal in December.
Timoshenko claims that the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, had been supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Qadhafi is buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists tend to win the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the customary law of the Shariah, which we have heard of.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society composed of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any event, our way of life is neither unique nor better, and it is likely that the Libyan population, for example, would not be suitable.
Indeed, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that they believe that NATO's raids were led not by an American general, but by God, whose greatness they praised after each strike.
And if there are winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent unfortunate experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of "crusaders."
Although without occupation, will oil companies receive Libya's black gold for almost no price?
And the West will finally be able to stand up for the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of the Shariah put an end to it.
A New Wave of Crisis Coming Up
France and the rest of Europe are now at the centre of investors' attention.
A statistical storm struck Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released GDP data in three quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnating, Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is beating the record today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by the expected 0.5%; France by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, where Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3 per cent instead of the original 0.1 per cent); France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information was expected to stagnate).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, as compared to the previous quarter, GDP was stagnating; according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stagnating compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the eurozone and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts ' projections.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
Its 10-year bond yield is 28.45 per cent.
The return of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching the critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech team was selected in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won a 1:0 score and celebrate an unexpected $200 million prize.
The National Team has successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the gorgeous Czech and Peter Jirachek's beautiful golf, they won the 1:0 score.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant advantage after a homecoming match, and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing significant in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jiracek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed Montenegro's team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanović and Vučinić became the worst match ever after they lost two great opportunities.
The great Peter Czech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and that Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the beginning, the game was very tense.
Both teams experienced difficulties in carrying out the combinations; the game took place most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from a team of masters in the first half, while further strikes across the line of defence were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a human shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, the prayers of the students were followed before the entrance to the building by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They have thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all evidence indicated that Iran had not abandoned attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday at noon, after the students' prayers before the entrance to the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant, he prayed for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of Iran ' s nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast or sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent are obese.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and the patterns of behaviour that accompany the human being for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears almost twice as frequently on the tables of children suffering from obesity as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 percent of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner prior to the poll on an educational event called Obesity is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but this is true of most families in modern schools - only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents found time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last school year and was attended by nearly 900 primary school students throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident for the second year in a row, with the support of Všeobecná zdravotní pojiškovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 pupils in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Good nutrition and sufficient sport are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of those interviewed said that they eat five meals a day, on the basis of a luncheon, luncheon, snack, snack, and this is one of the essential conditions for proper nutrition," says one of the conclusions of the study.
No lunch and sausage at night.
Experts warn that even relative details, such as the constant time of family breakfast, are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst discovery is that every tenth family has no breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study showed that roasted food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure drops by more than half - to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to prepare their own menus based on the products offered and on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large quantity of flour, meat, and sweet food.
"The great popularity of sweet cool drinks is of particular concern," says the final part of the study.
As the main dining meal, the pasta defeated the bird with a slight overweight.
However, children showed little interest in beans, fish and vegetables.
The Struggle for a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children are prepared to change their eating habits, provided that they are provided with relevant information.
"A large number of participants in the study team have demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they fill out the questionnaire after the lecture Obesity is not an accident," the outcome of the project states.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks - more children preferred just water to them.
In addition, as the main dish, children more frequently marked birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, as the professionals claim.
In the first article on stylist training, I looked at the amount of information available at the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; clothing selection boards for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
It's bigger.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments we can expect.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body isn't perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boy's figure without proper shape, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, extend the neck, or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, i.e., women with a higher breast and thigh and a narrow waist, and not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference in waist size and thigh size is so large that you can't pick up a skirt or pants, you should have at least one thing that's custom-made.
You certainly won't regret the investment, because perfectly sitting clothes are priceless.
In a skirt made on order, you'll feel much better than the one that moves away, rolls down, exposes the waist, etc.
Boy figures, on the other hand, may wear clothing with ruffles, applause, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of this information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize it.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each course participant had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity, one day and one night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothing, and their shape.
I'm gonna wear Miranda Kerr, which you might know from Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm excited about myself because it's a lot easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered tonne (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print them out and process them with graphics.
The Moodboard - so called the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude towards graphic representation.
It's important to keep the graphic part of the style in mind.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenick told us.
But it was only Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge.
Saturday's lecture, full of information about the shapes, gave life to three special guests in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pocorn; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Runch.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist must use that fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, you can wear a coat train regularly, over your jeans and t-shirts like a coat; but you can also wear it on your naked body, without any buttons, like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up your sleeves or raise your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"play with him," he stressed.
In any case, I appreciated the following advice: "You must know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them,' said Jakub.
Here I finally figured out why we're taking all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, whereas in fashion magazines, we often see something quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I've learned that the stylist on the stand should have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion view on ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the object of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others is not the same as in reality.
We have to bear that in mind when we make images.
Honza Pocorna confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing vocalist, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even well-known people often think it's unnecessary (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something and what they look like to be a secondary one).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to give us a different size (less) than the one they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about some celebrity getting fat/dead, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that for a stylist, it wasn't enough to understand fashion and be able to pick out an outfit.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to assess people, not to condone them, and not to hold opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look through her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can commend, and advise on what you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us what a work bag should contain.
It's a bag that you tie around the waist to wear.
In addition to obvious items such as scissors, sticky rollers or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it to film certain items, such as a bag or hat), special clips to attach tissue on the back in case the clothes are too large (bars and similar objects are prohibited because they spoil clothing) or sewing kit.
To distract ourselves from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned how to set up the shoes on the soles of the shoe.
Even during the filming in the studio, where the floor is smooth, the soles can be damaged - not to mention the filming on the street.
And here we are, working on the sticker.
You don't have to touch the shoe with scissors so you don't mess it up.
It requires real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like these skills.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: The escape takes place in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk became a routine morning trip to work due to a series of totally inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambition was to some extent satisfied, but it doesn't matter, because no one clearly wanted to do any extra work.
Before the new version with the sub-heading "Escape," there were great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the race games genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the result is a lot different than what we expected.
The game is a rather good arcade race, but the general impression is that there are several unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplained laziness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of a story whose main hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes on its own route, and the individual stages go on in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the same thing happens all the time in the game.
Although the graphs are at the same level as in previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to look at.
And yet the game doesn't give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs or high in snowy mountains are very pleasant.
Besides, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you fall into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under an avalanche.
Individual races are rather well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you're trying to outrun a few rivals (actually a conventional race); then you're trying to improve time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you're competing with one opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you run into the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of Jack's time escapes someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
While it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game, because it's not annoying; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows the tracks of previous models.
This means that it no longer represents anything special, but it cannot be considered a deficiency.
If you're looking for the simulation of real life, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, so good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't as good.
You don't expect a game like this to change and collide, but if you have no idea what your car's gonna do before you hit the target, something's wrong.
Usually, by overtaking or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch a different car slightly, and yet sometimes, in almost the same situation, your car starts spinning crazy.
Or crumbled.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
Restarts are designed so that if you break down or get away from the track, the game brings you back to the point where it's broken.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's good if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes restartings aren't enough, and you have to study a separate section of the race by heart.
The important weakness of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to go in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute later.
It's particularly annoying in situations where you see your rival easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you're in there, the cars are already positioned so that you either need to get around them or lose speed.
It doesn't matter when you're near them; it's arranged so that the situation always happens in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same rival overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's coming in front of you, he's making you look worse, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand trying to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get annoying fast.
Too bad, because despite the simple model of driving, the game is exciting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter if you don't miss it - a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during racing is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations along the way, because they're the ones where your car can change, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports machines are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are suitable for direct highway sections; and exotic super-sport cars are suitable for technical driving, such as curved mountain roads.
===Story mode===The main mode mode is closely linked to the challenge mode regime; it is an individual race that you will learn from the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and glasses common to the challenges and story regimes.
Many possibilities are available for higher levels of driving, ranging from machines to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players, and provides communication to the public.
Here's another drawback that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race to the sequence.
You and your car get into the subway tunnel (we'll think so), where you run on the tracks in the dark (we'll think so).
Your speedometer shows numbers ranging from 150 to 200 km/h (to be assumed) when a subway train suddenly hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, we've been discussing whether no one really thought for a second at the time of the game's creation, or whether its creators really think we're such fools.
The technical content of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video game is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is regrettable that at some critical points, the quality of the record is sometimes rather low.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants where a good recording wouldn't help you either.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the amateur.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack was "set up with different styles"; but it's unlikely that a lot of people buy a game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is pretty messy.
If the game were to avoid obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but prepare to be blinded by shortcomings as a spotlight on the airport.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
Chechs have a reputation for being ungrateful and skeptical in relation to the euro.
"The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable controversy among individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes in any way, calms down and all players get used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milena Vicenov gave his lecture in law school a hard start.
She has shown how much she adheres to her motto of "The Clear and Open About Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so easily and easily, it is clear that many lecturers from the Law Faculty of the KU would be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first, critics said that he was an ordinary grey office mouse that couldn't play any role; I have to say, everyone was struck by how well he did his role."
"He is a man who can listen to the twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, he is very good at communicating with them, and he has a clear idea of where the EU needs to go."
She explained her new position as representative of international relations and security as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?," that is, as an important step towards harmonizing and making more transparent the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one's gonna ban our cheeses.
Vicenova continued to focus on a programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success the previous year.
The Czechs had been dealing with an impending financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and had organized an East Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time had been a negative development that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
At present, Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have triggered a continuing ferment.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which less; and all those issues in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key messages she had brought to Brussels: "Europe, a language that is understandable."
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How can citizens understand that people in Brussels don't try to sell crooked or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our types of cheese?'
It will also make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multispeed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-skeptics; as well as people who point to negative rather than positive aspects of things.
She wants more Czechs to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are responsible for this: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; and, at the same time, little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary and join us with a lyric, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what's the meeting about, again, the Visegrad Group?" and he's not happy about it.'
In the future of the Vicenova Union, the new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the States parties are largely awaited.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed, Europe to be more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to be united, while those who did not want to be left out."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," waiting for Vicensov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
IBM's innovator enters the second century of his existence.
If anyone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one will probably be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's long-term sustainability was laid down by her first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, the eldest.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant was spread (and the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says the current CEO of Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care, just as Bata in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first US employees to be paid vacations, insurance from the employer, elegant uniforms, and a complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is equally advanced.
From the beginning, the company found brilliant applications for talented people, one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, which have generated many future innovations.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - about half a million people working in the company.
An organization with a good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in business is ensured by strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, from the point of view of the IBM concept, was more of an organization than a technology company," told the Economist, Professor Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds Jodge Colony from Forrester Research's consulting company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or "Blue Giant," as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the world's largest companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnologies.
She owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her employees won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, financial swaps, bar code and diskette.
With $220 billion in market capitalization data, IBM became the second largest technology company in the year (first place from Apple), outpacing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all of its products were of the same taste as customers and fit into the age. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy's online service; and IBM PCjr's computers.
"If your business is determined by the move forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, she's giving them up.
It is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is founded and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's main income comes from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, with half the capital, she was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, while at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of advanced technology.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM stock prices have risen by a record 120 per cent; the company ' s net earnings have risen steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM history: from raw knife to space missions.
==History==IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name, "Computation Corporation, Tabulation, Recording," was rather complex.
She took the name IBM in 1924 and originally called the brand, which was used for the company's Canadian and South American offices.
The future IBM was based on a merger of four companies, whose history began in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as legendary "table watch," i.e. watches that record when staff members come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Businessman Charles Runlet Flint, who until 1930 also headed the company's board of trustees.
Flint hired a competitor director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then moved IBM's founder into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of a solid corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from raw knives and meat cutters to cashiers.
In the first four years of Watson's administration, the proceeds doubled to $9 million, and the company's vast expansion began on all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA monitor space flights to Mercury, Saturn, and 1969, man flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, the IBM line System/360.
A classic PC that defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computers to Lenovo, a Chinese company, while buying PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus focusing entirely on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a world-class research group dedicated to speech recognition.
Richtarzhova about his infidel husband:
Yvette, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarge (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has laid down clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Richtarzhov explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova gave Bartošova's home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave Rjichan 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she's finally forgiven him.
Richtarju doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarj and Bartošov ever break up, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out."
"But he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I have something," said Richtarzhov, adding that she had already freed herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
As long as Josef has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not gonna change that."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance is still functioning; I'm in charge of repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, except we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge to Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a boyfriend with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yveta, and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst female habits: Are they touching you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains you go shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on a big sale?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
Still, which one of you wouldn't want to go shopping in clothes, looking for perfectly sitting clothes and trying them on (desiredly in different colour versions) in fittings?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men, it can be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
Eternal displeasure
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos, maybe I should start doing gymnastics."
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men are literally allergic to the constant complaints of partners about their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more such complaints arise, the more women annoy them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness.
It's like an endless story.
Glass wash, vacuum cleaner, floor wash, dust dust, bath cleaning, at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean cafe in dirty shoes, children for dirt in a clean sink, and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation," try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that your family should not be in the forefront of order and cleanliness.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Aim to Command
"Throw underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women enjoy gossiping, insulting, and intriguing against others.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk about who, where, who, how and why.
Every now and then, I guess we're all gossiping.
Let's be honest, that's probably the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, who, especially in the women ' s workplace, pose a great danger to their environment.
The Jagra and Doctor's results helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful shows of a hockey attacker, Jaromir Yagra, helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Caroline's ice, and again became the most successful Czech player in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a 30-year-old star; he added another show and was declared the best player in the game.
The two finals of the match also belonged to the team player Yaglom Yakuba Vorachek.
After the match, Yagra told foreign journalists that he predicted Gira a great evening.
"I told him before the match he'd hit a hatchet."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel these things," explained the Jag, after whose actions Giroux scored the goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a Czech trail.
The closing Harrickaines Vorachek took over the gang and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who scored between circles.
One second before the first break, Homeplayer Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, Flyers again took over.
Especially Giroux.
After an effective performance, he scored a third goal; his hit was later transformed into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Jag, praising his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years at the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Jag.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruuta and Dwyer's penalty, reducing the break to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reid went to the far end."
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked," described Voraček's impression of the final goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The champion of the Montreal Chech team, Jaroslav Spachek, did not finish the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the injury to the upper body.
Together with an experienced advocate, Canadiens lost his two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomas Plecan wasn't able to score one of their attacks.
More than the lost glasses, the home coach was upset by the high number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added P.K. Subban's defense attorney
After 30 attacks, Czech Holkiper Onja Pavelec helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets' heads, which interrupted the five-match series of defeats, were beaten by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five public tourism agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies of the time were mostly selling tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists went on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which imposed considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to go by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation from that country was needed; another individual journey was not possible.
At that time, travel agencies offered to travel to the West, but it was either necessary to stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Foreign exchange permits were necessary for travel to the West and were not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; it was not possible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West without a currency permit.
The Czechs spent most of their vacations at home, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that continues to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic has thus experienced a real revolution.
While prior to 1989 vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that until 1989 we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia today, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, marking the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough to travel to the West, everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (conserves, salami, etc.) in order to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a free convertible Czech kroner, after decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income have been rising, leading to another important development around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has made it possible for travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines, and air travel has now become incredibly cheap as compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually every developed world except the US, which made our travels even easier.
The next significant development in the history of post-revolutionary travel took place in 2000, with a strong demand leading to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will follow twelve exotic routes.
At present, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important development in this period, representing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. cancelled the visa requirement for Czech tourists, and our country has thus become a permanent member of the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during their leave abroad, including their expenses at destination.
The General Assembly must choose the president, the threat of the party returns.
For about five months, Czech football had no president, and there was a risk that Ivan Gasek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), would not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburka on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what election rules to follow.
Without that, the voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Yindrzhich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Pazlik want to lead Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and when he left, he called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, Gasheka's era once again plunged football into a dispute between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on 16 September, when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the National House in Prague, Smykhov, for the negotiations had remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials to whom credentials had been granted.
That point had since been resolved in part by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights that representation based on delegated authority was not possible.
The debate over the rules of the elections, however, continues.
The Executive Council has also not been very helpful, although in its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is a matter that it is mostly concerned with.
The perception of voting methods has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How do we get to the third round and avoid the Pat?
"The question is whether to follow the established standards or find another model," says one of FAČR's vice-presidents, Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
On the basis of the model provided for in the statute, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received greater support from the Chamber from which he is standing.
Moravia is said to accept a compromise to consider the winner of the election as the candidate with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage, the winner must obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
"At the same time, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of two chambers," Freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said it would have been better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
Tomás Pazlik agrees with his opinion somewhat suddenly, although it is estimated that the electoral rules defined by the statute are more favourable to Pelt than to other candidates.
"I'd like the election to go as far as possible."
"I want to avoid all possible representational stupidity, as in the previous general meeting," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate; and in his comments, he largely contradicted Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He trusted that the new President would be known in Nimburka; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fermentation will calm down after today's expected national tournament in the European Championship."
"Football will be on the happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says Yablonets' representative, of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management, both professional and regional.
Reichle's more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It could cause another breakdown in the general meeting."
"I hope common sense wins," said Reichle.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
Some reports indicate that some negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight that was to be delivered, among others, to Vice-Presidents Daliber Kucher and Reichla in Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure.
After all, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected on Wednesday, can be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like to see the opposing parties in the country ' s strongest sports association reach an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with a new Czech sports director after Sazka's financial problems.
The patsel is in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If, before the Extraordinary General Assembly, the head of football players Plzejn Tomás Pazlik had seen a strong candidate who would have met all his demands for the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even have claimed a high office.
"If I had been a worthy candidate, I would have fought for him and not been a part of the fight myself."
"But this man hasn't been found yet," said Pazlik ČTK.
Pazlik's motive to fight against Miroslav Pelta and Yindrzhich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelte, an alleged electoral favorite, from entering the administration of FAČR.
Moreover, Palzlik stresses that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be filled by an experienced top manager, not too connected to football life.
"I've talked to a few people you could have in mind."
"It was awful for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to be involved in Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
At present, the Patzlik's main disagreement with Pelt is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbro, president of the regional football association in Plsen, and Berbre is a man of a controversial reputation known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
The paltic thus considers it unacceptable that Pelta should become President.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward."
"With Berb's support for a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football," said Pazlick.
He's insinuating that a few years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during a phone audition during a corruption investigation; Pelte escaped a sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pazlick, he now doesn't mention his earlier saying that he would "sell the club Plzehn if Pelta became president."
If Pazlick wins on Thursday, he could present a future collaboration with Pelta.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, who was supported by Pazlik before the general assembly in September, which ended its fiasco.
"He would be the first person I'd turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can imagine him running the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose for things I don't understand either," said Pazlick, who attracted a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of the judge's team led by Ludek Matsela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
The pattle claims he's gonna risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to force the football environment to change, to support its change for the better."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of people who tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Board, which leads to disgusting situations," Patzlik said, "he does not hide his antipathy to, for example, Sparta's director Daniel Krzetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sport from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points the new president should be dealing with."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must state clearly where the money will go," he said.
The kid doesn't consider his connection to the Plesen Club to be a burden, although he claims that the president of the FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to Jablonetz, and Reichl's connected to Prague Duclo.
"It's not the perfect option."
"And yet I don't see the point of a hypocrite handing over my shares of the Plsen Club to someone else, since I'm going to be back there in six months," says Pazlick.
Pelta has promised new FAČR rules to avoid the Chosen Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules in order to avoid future disputes over election rules.
Prior to the talks on Thursday in Nimburka, the Yablonets' functionary remains optimistic and believes that attention from the electoral struggle will significantly divert today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment before the last general assembly, so a two-month delay could be useful to him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association," says a man, mostly affiliated with the Jablonets Club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gashak's reign.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different ways of representation had not been accepted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He viewed the census of the key civil association document as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider this my personal task, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," Pelta argues.
Besides, he says he's not trying to single out himself against rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindrjih Reichl, whom he valued for legal education; he was well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should be his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he hadn't attacked Thomas Pazlik, who was always criticizing Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's made some progress."
"In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by the way he campaigned."
"And so some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said about his competitor, and Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon to be knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"After that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," a 40-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'm gonna need to know the job descriptions of the individual employees." That was his message to the Insurance, where the prolonged period of power is making me nervous.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the planned general assembly, he trusted that delegates would come to Nimburk on Thursday not in vain.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold elections in the third round, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust that he can gain by finally electing his leader," says Pelt, who two days before the key day of his career as a functioner remains optimistic.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR will begin to work actively
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Yindrich Reichle, the incumbent vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are rumored to be unhappy.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, there will be a time for hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain football areas.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashak.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football and football events for young people."
"I don't mean to say I'll do it myself," said Reichle in his interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to divide powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I will carefully assign tasks so that each of these segments of football takes great steps forward."
"It probably won't please many people, because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move," he explained his doubts.
"Nevertheless, a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, or other people would come."
"That trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to get over it."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, were elected, the Association might return to what was before Gasek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelt is unlikely to have."
"He's surrounded by people who would do football so that he's only available to the elected ones."
"I can be accused in a lot of ways, but certainly not of subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Reichl.
Moreover, he refutes the allegations that he will only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Though a lot of people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reichl.
While the president's club manager, Plzejn Tomas Pazlik, does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its Vice President, and I see that I have made some obvious progress," said Reichl. To his success, he attributes the savings of tens of millions of kroner on bad contracts, the negotiation of contracts with television, and the negotiation of a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
While claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football," he considers another rival, Pazlika, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year."
"If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without substantial staff changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his own benefit," said Reichle about his rival.
Europe's Most Beautiful Basins
Jump in the water.
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can test Europe's incredible water - and relax a tired body in a hot tub after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't have done during his research trips for the past year and a half: without his bathing suit.
Laying on her back in water, she looked up at the delicious dome, swam up to the marble sheruvims waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and watched carefully restored swimming pools in the style of ar-novo.
She was in a hurry to add every pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
Meder's architecture historian inspected more than 200 swimming pools - and now gathered impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden, which went from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the bathing suits in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Croatia and Serbia.
The 46-year-old author is a real bathing culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that swimmers have to accept blue coffee tile and chlorine smell, while runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyous chickens in the park.
"Once I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so awful," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Flushing in the pool and fine oils in the sauna are so important in bathing suits because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the builders take on this kind of work. "Instead of the floor in the pool you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
It's a visual reflection: high ceilings, color tile, and tramples.
The illustrated 190-page edition of "The Beauty of Bathing" contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and you want to jump into the water.
Meder's water collector found some outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
She found nitrate - rich water in a karst cave (Miskolc-Tapolce Cave) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottled building (Városi Termálfürdö in Yasberen) as well as excellent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old bathtub in Budapest.
From many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there's an amazing view. You can see the whole Zurich from a bathing suit on the roof, or you can see the snowy Arlberg from an open pool in St. Anton, and there's a window in the steam room that allows you to see what's going on on on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for swimmers in Langenfeld, the Aqua cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In the winter, a pair of three open shells rise from it, which seem very small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwartzwald
Meder pool gatherer didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
A lot of heat bathing suits smell like gray, arcad's beakeshchab dolls smell so much oil, you might find it hard to believe that you're in a healing source.
Smells cause hydrocarbonates in alkalin water. The water is almost black from a needle that sticks to the skin as soon as you sink into a pool - a certain type of healing experience.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open Czech bathing pool in Lugačovica, she discovered that the area was sealed.
The dolls, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the red-white-yellow-style windows of the Arnovo building, she saw weed growing between the cafeteria tiles.
One of the hot spots where the destruction was stopped is the amazing swimming pool in Schwartzwald, the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
You will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritanian Algambra Hall, added around 1900.
After careful reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace - the favorite swimming pool of the Iris Meder basin expert - and not just because it comes from Schwartzwald.
"It's a real accomplishment - so masterful to combine these different architectural styles," says Meder.
Diving into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary activity.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank investigates agricultural trade.
Christian Tivs
Will the Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks exploit agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of those interviewed demanded that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbated the problems facing the world ' s poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on behalf of a consumer organization, Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schumann, demonstrates that world commodity exchange rates raise prices - and banks are thus involved in the world's famine.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly at the head of Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also traded.
Initially, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned supply and demand rules - and profit from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "is worth compromising the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Merchandise trade may decline or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, emphasizing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "Stats on rising food prices are a flagrant example of the recklessness of banks now acting against common interests."
As the bank's main lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"Deutche Bank must remove from the portfolio all the investments that make money for food prices," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter whether it's starving people or Deutsch Bank's reputation."
Ackermann's quick reaction at first surprises me, but the director would like to have a perfect image just a few months before he ends up in his office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little or no need to care for the costs, and his successor will have to deal with the consequences.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bodé published the study on Tuesday, a study for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis, Forsa, 7 and 8 November, and 1,001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent believe that investments that put a price on food are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also have taken concrete steps if they had found that their bank was involved in such a trade; according to the study, every other bank would have withdrawn the deposits that ultimately led to speculation in the goods.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they'd consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st-century house in Vienna
The Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vissowski
The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, empty and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
Austria's pavilion, designed by Karl Swanzer for the 1958 World Exposition in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, bold to express faith in technological progress.
Swanzer's pavilion won the Grand Prix in architecture in 1958 for his light floating steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next World Exposition.
After all, he was famous for his legendary BMW four-cylinder tower and her sister, a cup-shaped building, in 1973.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna South Station, transformed and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - often referred to as the 20th Century House for this reason.
In any case, the building did not fit the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which artwork could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna acquired a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which was called the House of the 21st Century and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night - a joyous event in every sense.
Agnes Hussein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new venture.
Hussein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a youth figure who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Modernist Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guardians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was supposed to include a permanent exhibition of the Frits Wonruba Foundation, a cafe and bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict Control & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was the perfect candidate for the project back then.
He was known, of course, thanks to the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession, Josef Olbrih, and won the competition, but he also studied with Swanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna, and the pavilion was "exceptionally important" for him, where he attended exhibitions "almost every week."
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems encountered during the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was an "energy absorber," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass fibre-enhanced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The thermal bridge was reinforced or replaced and asbestos removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for a new use of the building, a falling light well between the building and the street providing lighting - a virtually new building, but still the elegant pavilion of Swanzer.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red brown colour of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
It's all under strict control of the museum department and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and approved by the museum department," says Krishanitz, pointing out that it was uneven in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, challenges and transformations.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rude - typical story of "drips in the city."
Such an architecture is "always out of place" and nevertheless wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21st-century house is in a very right place, because the city's planning has had unexpected success, and a completely rebuilt "main station" block with offices and real estate grows around the Swiss garden.
The 21st century house could be supplemented by the second building of Krishanitz, the French collector von Habsburg, who purchased the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and reportedly negotiates with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced a crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of trains in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and late trains.
Referring to the Deutsche Bahn internal crisis plan, Bild reports that a total investment of about 300 million euros is planned for 2015.
Investments are intended to increase the productivity of locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and engaged staff involved in snow cleaning from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before starting work and 90 percent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellation and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties with passenger transport, as she lacked reserves at a time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have waited years for the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had to check ICE train axes much more frequently for many years after one of the ICE trains broke its axis at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay many million pounds of fine in the US
New trouble followed the unrest around Joseph Ackermann, Director General Deuce Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine of many million pounds in the United States.
It's like Deuce Bank wasn't having enough trouble in his home country, the past of an industrial giant in the United States is now catching him up, and the Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to calm down the disputes that arose after the bankruptcy of the five largest credit unions during the financial crisis.
The problem arose over the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), the regulator of the financial market, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
Bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and pushed down credit unions.
"We're glad we solved this problem without the parties going to court," said Deuce Bank's representative in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not plead guilty.
The same is true for the Citigroup, which has agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the rapid reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting for damages that come out of billions.
It's the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble burst in 2007 in the U.S. real estate market.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 in the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators filed a large number of claims seeking compensation or punishment for fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It blames the 18 largest international banks for buying some $200 billion worth of collateral from US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also facing the threat of prosecution by FHFA of numerous agreements worth $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, assume responsibility for "material losses" but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM.
Buffett's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought more than ten billion dollars worth of shares.
So far, Warren Buffett, the largest American investor, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for IT departments in other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was considered a knightly act.
IBM, an IT veteran, has now won the title "Sir IBM."
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC Buffet reported that since March he had purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding of Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 per cent share.
Buffet said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management that had managed to generate profits even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," Buffet said, with a management strategy in mind.
IBM's long-standing focus was on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claimed he only invested in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in engineering.
His holding of Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of his own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built one of the world's most expensive companies with skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct in making money gave him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
The IBM stock price increased by one percent before the opening of markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, stands on the stock market at over $220 billion, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Indefinite danger
After the discovery of the cell in Zwikkau, Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One of the papers speaks of a "blood ideology" that is now coming back to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a response to this report in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has given rise to long-forgotten fears, and there have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the arson attacks in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered has a scope that is not yet fully understood.
"The Rebirth of Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret informant of the secret services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, branding the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was slapped. "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X," commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
Nor did the German edition of Hürriyet miss the occasion to draw this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Külahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to Germany ' s transformation have been killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid were strongly criticized on the German-Turkish Internet forum.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought of following suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles.
Some authors have reached a rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsy as they do, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves in the armed forces."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"Peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is opened and on the legality of punishment," writes "Selen."
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply reminiscent of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks so clearly living here that they are in danger and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the German police's failures following the attacks, and Helmut Kol refused to visit the Mellin survivors.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the arson in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech to calculate the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he defined a man's value as the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German State has deepened since then.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on the Zurich Lake
Most of Europe's high-risk banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since fought one or another crisis without interruption.
Now the German has to get him back on course.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he was gonna get that part.
In July, following his successful resignation from the position of head of the Federal Bank, he was announced to take office in 2013 at the same time as the chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss UBS bank; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously thrilled, praised Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
UBS managed to change for the better.
"I look forward to working with Caspar Phillip and Oswald Grubel."
But it became clear in September that things would be quite different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The UBS Executive Director, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS board of directors is considered sick, and everyone wants to know when Alex Webber will finally take office?
Weber is due to advise the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank announced on Tuesday, he will be chair of the board as early as May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he'll certainly need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long deserved the title of "the biggest banking scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very big - until recently he's managed the world's largest assets - and on the other, it's been a scandal for years.
The proud Swiss bank seems to spare nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
UBS had a great reputation until 2007.
The Bank combined the image of a hidden and stable, yet clever asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
and, as an investment bank, entered the league of the world's largest banks.
It was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains: "I have always used UBS as a model of a good bank for my students."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask me how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong in UBS.
In mid-year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley - who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit tried to play sub-prime securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
Indeed, the Bank was able to find investors - but investors whose services many bankers would have been politely withdrawing from until recently - one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund hidden to such an extent that even its name was not reported.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce billions of new losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, the second-largest salary in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, there was a disaster, and due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was threatened with collapse, and the government had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences of large banks settling in a small country.
After all, the total UBS balance in 2007 was five times more than all Swiss production (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the US and stated that he was willing to hand over data from wealthy clients who might have been tax-exempt with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of refunds of unjustified profits from business plus fines.
UBS thus more or less acknowledged that it was a tool for tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always his advantage in fighting for rich clients - a veil of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
The client's money came to an end.
In a few months, the bank has lost confidence in both of its main activities - investing in bad speculation and managing assets as a result of aid and encouraging tax evasion.
And it all calmed down, and it seemed like the UBS was able to reverse the situation, like the crash with the fraud-trader, and the only trader had dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not working yet.
"The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of Zurich University.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have a risk control tool."
It was precisely caution that for a long time Swiss bankers had made the world's largest asset custodians - not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world had collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli represent the refined taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still correspond to the image of a decent Swiss private bank - only a little more.
Her location is classic in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow hats of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprüngli are jewelry firms such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credi Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Bare.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather sofas along the marble walls, near the bank's logo, a large safe sign.
UBS knows what his clients need - reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss concepts of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he's also working with the two biggest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - particularly in the investment banking, where the Anglosaxes are very active.
In his opinion, the Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if there's anything, they've adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banker who changed UBS, brought him the first big profits - and then the fiasco - that no other financial institution in Europe lost so much money in the jungle of subprime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On that Wednesday, a ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million launched the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," Lucas Hassig wrote in her book UBS Crash.
Politicians approved 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they'll say that the problem is mainly in the amount of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger was established - and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but advanced bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin a omnipotent wheel.
Two names are related to UBS growth: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolffley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and deep-seated model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, all the way up, starting with an intern at the bank."
But Ospel eventually put his trust in Wolffley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS officials remember well the meetings of board members, where Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the "Turn Table" where the success of the banks was made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to do some of that.
UBS was the largest player in the trading of currency and government securities.
The authorized management advisers, however, pointed to a weak position, according to a parameter called "permanent revenue" in banking terms, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS has failed in US mortgages.
To shut the hole, UBS got involved in an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in US subprime securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on US mortgages and sold them further - while continuing to carry the risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way out of this process for a long time, UBS hasn't stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than at first.
The UBS posts have become a children's game with chairs and remain unreliable until today.
Anyone who runs this huge bank is faced with an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that turns its back on all existing business models.
The bank analyst Geiger already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
It is clear, however, that investment activities need to be substantially curbed.
The new bank manager, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to show character and now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, is leading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to its mid-1990s position.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions are probably asking themselves Axl Webber.
All he's said so far is that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of a recession in Europe pulling down the US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome has had little effect.
The decline in the continent ' s industrial output has dashed hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the changes of government in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a fall of 0.6%.
The market barometer varied between 12,027 and 12,170 points during the bidding process.

The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 percent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.
Eurostat Statistics reported that in September, companies produced 2 per cent less than the previous month.
This message turned American investors into skeptics. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to quickly shake the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, was able to only confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it took to end the crisis.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a decade-long principle into the trash and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM in excess of $10 billion raised the price of this oldest company's shares by almost one percent against the trend in the course of the bidding.
The stocks closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffet claimed to have paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 per cent share.
The stock price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America stocks fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.

Smart ravens fill cities
Graci is considered problematic birds in many places, and experts say today that these very smart birds can no longer be driven out of cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the ravens have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants complaining of mud and noise are increasing in many localities.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, is still far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on ravens in the city of Lehr in East Frizia, experts argued that the rook could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Urban alternatives
Conservativeists argued that the root of the urban problem was the migration of specially protected glands, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, the growing construction and cutting of traditional trees made it difficult for birds to live.
The ravens are under guard.
There are large colonies in Westphalia and in the north-west in Yevera, Dipholce, Ahima, Bremen and Lera, with more than 600 parents.
A mixed crow shooting project in Lehr caused unsettling newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described trapping birds and slaughtering them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
"Ordinary movement and fear don't work," said the architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lear.
Water nesting or tree felling often had undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas."
Fear is only possible as an exception near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from surrounding areas, the urban problem will not be solved, " says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
Combining the intimidation of birds from areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stand instead of chainsaw" was a slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information on the lives of very intelligent glands is provided on the information booths.
The project is already attracting interest from tourists.
Jürgens also gave her opinion on complaints of noise from birds. "The noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The glitters often use weapons not only to take a piece of them but also to make them themselves.
Researchers of behavior at Cambridge University recently tested the bird's mind on four rooks.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to knock on a plaque to get a larvae of moths.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the tablet.
In another experiment, smarter rooks had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers put a small bucket of moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get their beak.
But researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to tie a bucket behind a pen and pull it out of a cylinder.
Three out of four rooks did it the first time they tried.

The Turks were almost able to start perfectly in front of 31,000 viewers at Maximeer Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long strike hit the counter for the seventh minute, and Kazim Kazim's assailant failed to kick the ball into the grid.
Croatia then woke up and became increasingly seized of control of the game.

Massacres - A Human Dimension
Peter Englund's tense and very kind new book, "The Beauty and Grief: The Personal History of World War I," begins with a long list of actors from which the heart freezes.
Here's a tip on how to read: carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very close as Mr. Anglund tells you, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at moments when, like one of these men and women, you'll get lost and lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's written right now is unusual, he describes it quite accurately as "anti-history work."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, slender journalists or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, how much "book about what it looked like," it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and the state of the spirit."
The book "Beauty and Grievance" brought together the experiences of 20 more or less unmarked men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people are gonna be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses his arm or leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are shimmering here like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some will be extinguished at that time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the historical book standard.
This is also an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a severe, extensive war on the West Front.
"Beauty and Grievance" ably gives the panorama of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unsolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless powder.
When there's a canonnade nearby, and you're a woman and you're at home with the kids, will you stay or run?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war.
"Deficiencies," Mr. Englund notes, "recovered by conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and Grief" tracks the fate of people like Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas Flot.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters, and other materials already published.
The stories about their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are extremely alive thanks to Mr. Englund ' s small moments and partial details.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
When he tells the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere is an erzaz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about erzazz food in Germany.
He describes "measles of pressured rice welded in ovine fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes covered with wood."
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes authorized for the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories speak of honor and courage.
One American observes the most violent tendency and says about war: "You feel that, after all, it's what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, a evening newspaper or a bestseller, and to claim that this display is civilization and that under your cufflinked shirt there's no barbarous hiding underneath."
On the contrary, the British soldier observes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or grieve.
"When a man accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the other way around, it's scary like a convicted man being hanged in secret.
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," says Mr. Englund, "war factories."
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new view of the ingenuity of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stained suit that makes a massacre at the desk."
People act in an unexpected way: low-level actions are as much as heroics.
Mr. Englund described soldiers who had tried hard to catch a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the sale of gonorrhea pus, which the soldiers bought and greased through their genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital," he writes.
"All desperate people rubbed him in the eye, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated with Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but unbridled, perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "set free completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start asking why their leaders make them fight.
The best books of World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's Great War and Modern Memory or novels such as Erich-Marie Remark's Western Front without Change, rather than exhaustive historical writings.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this non-shablonized pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in non-artistic literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached the page with the list of characters, grabbed it from your hands, and burned it with a match.
After previous error, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zukotti Park was supposed to have the lowest number of people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the rest at first told them they were going to the drill.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, his presence underlined the importance the Police Department attached to the operation.
There was no question of repeating episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to departmental rules and caused a hurricane of sympathy among the public for the occupiers.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to release Zukotti Park from protestors.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randalls Island, with a focus on Zucotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the last minute, " said a source familiar with the orders, which referred to the assignment only as "training."
"The few cops I know who were summoned to this case didn't tell them they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke on the basis of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were in the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who had gone inside before the deadline, hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved members of various police units, including those from the districts, a team of police officers who were usually used to control the criminal surrounding area.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like to work, come and leave the park during the day, which makes one hour of the morning the right time for an offensive.
"It was right to do that when the park had the least people," he said.
Rescue vehicles with lights and loudspeakers gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and pre-recorded ads that were coming out of the loudspeakers seemed to scare many protesters.
When administrative officers entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply packed their bags and left.
The police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack.
Other police teams, according to eyewitness accounts, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through the chest of protestors' personal belongings, including bags, plastic rugs and plastic bags, full of clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what had been thrown.
Some protesters who refused to leave were taken outside, and photographs of them soon appeared on the Internet.
A major group of protesters took up positions near the kitchen camp at the centre of the park.
Some have built barricades, and the police have been walking inside, arresting them methodically.
About 10 people in the camp's epicentre shackled themselves together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The rescue service was called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until around 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, and the police reported it.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 people had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for "disruption of public order and resistance to detention," he said.
The highest officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the department's wanted police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, said "not leading the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they had to go inside.
The fences were placed on Courtland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police expand the perimeter even beyond the Zukotti Park border from these positions.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, displacing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protestor jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the police van's tires.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The School Service Staff Union will sue the city for dismissal
The union, representing hundreds of school staff members who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
Trials are probably the last means available to a union of District Council 37 trying to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a focal point for working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of what trade union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health funds managed by workers ' groups to close the hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearings last month, School Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that dismissals were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board was paralyzing, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that the school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of 37 District Councils reported that they had filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that an action had been brought against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of a claim with the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education will be listed as the defendants in the claim, and the eight employees who have been suspended will be listed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as will most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint at the disposal of the New York Times, the union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He states that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school assistants lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working at the free secondary school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim states: "These are not wealthy parents' areas that can find money to make up for budget failures."
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it counted supplementary funding for every poor student who went to school.
The trade union also argues that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The notification used the word "exceed," although the word "exceed" is more commonly used when a teacher from the school payroll moves to a list of available employees paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been dismissed," says the draft suit, "not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress is ready for Libya agreement
The Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol Hill seem to be finally willing to agree on something to do with the rebellion in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, long-time dictator Muammar Qadhafi was captured and killed, and American intervention was over.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut), who praises the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the American troops for their "grabble."
"The meaning of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has taken place easily.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the United States army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing the limited use of United States military forces in Libya.
The bill had been rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and had never been put to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the American operation in Libya.
It left the American mission in some kind of legislative purgatory - when Congress was annoyed enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to really knock the ground out of her feet.
Then the events overcame Congress's indecisiveness.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and Qadhafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "appreciates the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary steadfastness in their quest for freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Would the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or split the legislature like the June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader of the Committee, opposed the latest version.
Luger's representative said he hadn't seen the latest version of the bill on Monday.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives this week must vote for a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators had not yet been able to submit their amendments to the plenary, but not because they had not tried.
The Goodlat Amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that address the wide range of issues that have been introduced in this meeting.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone and some more about "control of federal expenditures."
Some of them are also identical, but give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their résumés - the opportunity to boast that they have "supplied" such an offer.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of members of Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrat, New York), wants to lift the two-term limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments to guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving as fast as they have been in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress they introduced 66.
This rate is no longer high compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the Senate Library.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was adopted, 27th, was approved in 1992, but was actually made to Congress in 1789.
"Battered, but not defeated," says Giffords in his first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at a public event in Tucson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona), appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, sang a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun will return" and said that she wanted to recover more than go back to Congress.
After appearing on the 20/20 program of ABS News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her difficult recovery from a bullet injury that fractured the skull and smashed the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the bill on the ceiling debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "hard."
When Sawyer asked how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special issue of 20/20, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book by the spouses "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope."
A special release told me about the recovery of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In the video that Kelly made in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physical therapists teach her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word is "what."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast," asking for a change in the breakfast menu.
The video shown by A.B.C. shows that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: we see the congressman singing along with the doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she didn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read an article in the newspaper about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six that were killed then.
Suspect Jerry Lee Lafner is being held in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"A lot of people have been killed," said Giffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not defeated," Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, seafarers, pilots and marines were set up around him on the signal.
The tuxedo audience applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized a spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also attended by the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted what was best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The opposite is illustrated by the difficult relationship that has developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops are being wasteful of praise for their sacrifices.
But praise has its price, says the soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting like it feels sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who was in command of troops in Iraq and is leaving for Afghanistan soon.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
It's a sensitive subject for warlords who don't want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most of the talk of pity takes place quietly and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from the fighting as part of the Marines, retired colonel Mark Kension warned them that the army would not look at their service in two ways.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have defeated the rebels and been in exotic places.
Others will wonder if a violent veteran is hiding under the mask, " said Kent, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he told him that he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington just after the battle.
Cannes recalls how he told his sons: "When you talk about your service, you must expect a negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military comes in part from American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that has little knowledge of the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism as usual in World War II," says Retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
Troops are estimated by the number of trips they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the extent of the loss.
The army is facing increasing pressure from anti-rape supporters
This week, the historic court hearing must decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army on charges of not opposing rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old, and 11 weeks pregnant, was allegedly raped at night by her co-worker.
This was in October 2008, when she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a male co-worker carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come into her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But Texas's birthplace has allayed its fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will await the trial at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld, will go to court.
The claim alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to cope with widespread military violence in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by servicemen, and that the army failed to properly investigate, prosecute or bring to justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the highest ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can eliminate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that since February she has been contacted by some 400 other victims, many of whom may be involved in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she'll open up a lot of cases if necessary to maintain pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBride, took steps to close the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers cannot bring claims against the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court judgement by Doctrina Ferez, the Federal Government is not liable for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage refers to the inherent risk of military service of the plaintiffs" is stated in the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on the story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: today's wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s soldiers ' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veteran Law Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, which is centred on the diagnosis of "identity changes" being made to the victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group Organization for Women Soldiers.
Her team had filed a lawsuit against the Veteran Affairs Department in December accusing him of discriminatory practices in the processing of applications for pensions from people who claimed to have been at risk of sexual violence while in service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures have been introduced into Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But as is well known, attacks are often not reported, and according to Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure represents approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of reported cases reached trial, half the number of cases in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case call attacks only the first in a series of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to share the details of the rape with police officers, doctors and commanders on 11 separate occasions.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the victim's blood - from the cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing asking her whether she had had sex with her friend earlier the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive description to the accused, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was having a baby - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commanding officer saying, "It wasn't his trial, it was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a change of identity, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her teammates is a difficult question, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "In my opinion, they are in a position to move forward."
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into existence.
I've been criticizing Doctrin Ferez my whole life.
The army has fallen behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds: "The Shans are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, whichever happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breivik was an ordinary guy who shared his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Bravik could act alone, he was far from being alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing for his computer attack, interacting with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized it was easy to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism at the British DEMOS Research Centre.
The availability of personal data on Facebook is so high, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific precision - what marketologists have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans all over Europe and then planted an ad for them, but instead of showing a new band or a diet product, the ad offered the user a survey that included questions about their level of education, attitudes to violence and optimism about their own future.
With Facebook's help, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview over 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even leaving the office.
"This is a completely new way to do research," Bartlett says.
Some results are less striking: online right-wing groups - most often male youth, who are unhappy with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world, ranging from health issues to social trends expressed in "Likes," posts on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries a day, Facebook's "super-relevant information" causes a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title of the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it allows you to study people you can't approach on the street with a notebook.
"If you wanted to interview people from the British National Party earlier, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all of this-- you're addressing them directly."
Others say that the site could identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of Wisconsin University, Madison, and her colleagues revealed that students who discussed their drunken performances on Facebook were significantly more likely to be at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their hostel mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunken statuses.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," reported Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Conduct and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who wouldn't otherwise be found."
Facebook also constantly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The website's data processing team processed statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout mid-term in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mainly using information they have access to only - the champions of cyberfreedom have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined rules for conducting offline research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users have at least thought about what an researcher can observe their profiles," says Neil Selwin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the students' public Facebook pages.
"How they imagined it was just between them and their friends."
The question then arises as to the methodology.
There's no guarantee even offline that the subject of the study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two totally different things," Selwin says.
That is why, despite the years of its work in technology research, Selwin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools available for use.
"Nothing can replace getting into the real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline."
The Cold and Inhuman: Anders Bering Breivik will be publicly brought to justice for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that claimed the lives of 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a resistance fighter during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of the Tampliers of Norway," he spoke in front of the 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I accept the action, but I don't admit it."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a prewritten speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives attended the hearing.
Some have come to look Brevik in the eye, others to make sure he's kept under lock and key.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," told Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors of Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally it made me feel a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Bravik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a large resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said that there was no evidence that he was dealing with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the attacks of July 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But it doesn't automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation is feeling.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but he's not," said a relative of one victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it were."
Seven lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs that's being shown in the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing him as a technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can think of as the biggest discovery in a newly discovered interview that has been remembered in advance of pre-shows in major markets this week is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and he thought he was a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and upgrader of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "a disease to think that a really great idea is 90% of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a great amount of skill."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley was creating a television series Triumph Nerds about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been kicked out of Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company, NeXT, waiting for the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Kringley was used in Nerda, he says the original interview was missing during transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This film, slightly edited, became the basis for a 68-minute film by Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, released on Landmark Theatres on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for hating a detailed interview, Jobs seems to be unusable here to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points in the interview, there are long intervals between questions and answers - reflections of 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems annoyed by Kringley's questions, which make him move faster to issues or events of greater importance.
In the Picsar era, the iPods and iPhones of the Lost Interview, there is something sinisterly prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies are doing right and wrong and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the postmortem assessments of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, a disturbing dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned how to run a business:
"All the time in business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize reporting in Apple.
Disturbed by the way of recording expenditures, often beginning with "standard costs," which were taken off the ceiling and then brought up by "clearing up," he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business expenditures down to little.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs tells us in detail about the blue box he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack a phone company and call long distances free of charge.
There's been a lot of writing about the device before, but Jobs' euphoria is here when you describe the blue box as an act of power-sharing is contagious.
He tells us how he and Wozniak tested the box using a telephone machine, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been yelling at the phone machine, and it's been a minute since the next phone machine," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could make something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think without it Apple could ever show up.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous act that he and Wozniak practically handled by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two were laughing just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About in love with technology (and the cold name Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, after chasing spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer."
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic ray tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and circle around that car and write programs for her.
Improvised innovation:
In a few places, Jobs' interview is talking about the invention of new products for the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installation fees, a buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on a loan, he had to consider both the assembly and the delivery of finished devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember violent arguments... they yelled at me that it would take me five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I came out, and I found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Big companies that lose energy:
Long before he led Apple's revival, Jobs predicted exactly how many industry leaders would misunderstand the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who end up running companies, and people making products are pushed off the decision-making platform.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is being replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the skill required.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be Microsoft of the '90s...
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea separates a great amount of skill from the great product... "when you twist a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make - some things you can't force to make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head - these concepts - connecting them all together...
In the end, it all comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to express itself in the best things that people have ever done, and later to try to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made the famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had come to be the world's best IT professionals.
If it weren't for information technology, they'd be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of the health law while the court is seized of the case.
On the day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether it would listen to the rebuttal of the health law of President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, was honoured for lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions before them.
One of the cases on the agenda was a petition supported by 26 states challenging the rapid review of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, a 5 1/2-hour turning-out debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to stand in the way of a presidential race that will be in the middle of the time when the judgement will be delivered.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health law must be repealed will most likely be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Feds Society dinner, a long-standing group that has consistently advocated conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel hours after the trial.
There was Mitch McConnell, a Republican leader in the Senate and a known opponent of the health law, among others.
Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the conduct of lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, a guest of honour or be mentioned in the programme of such an event."
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"It is an overwhelming violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"The judges drank and had dinner at an official fund-raiser with the lawyers now in court."
Their appearance and the facilitation of the collection of money for this event undermines all allegations of disinterest and is unacceptable.
Skalia and Thomas hardly draw attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups like the Federalist Society in business.
And Thomas' wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that this is an ethical issue for Judge Kagan rather than Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were raised at the level of the first instance court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown that she's going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 billion orders for airplanes.
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777 aircraft and may be ordering another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the value of the deal being over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft engineer, and the price for all of these 50 planes is $18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend his largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total price to $26 billion, declared Boeing on the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could boast much better fuel savings and passenger comforts.
The price of six aircraft will be more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said the analyst Morningstar Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices, which usually damage airlines, as it is one of their largest expenditures, is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important, because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel a plane order when prices rise, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates' order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-fluesian airline market and helps prevent Airbus SAS rivals from attempting to encroach on its dominance with their A350 airliner.
The Boeing victory on the air show was four months after Airbus announced that he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competed with 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the axial load after the buyers demanded an increase in the capacity and range of the flight.
The Boeing Co stock increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister apparently lost in the Michoacán election.
Luisa Maria Calderón claims that drug traffickers were assisting the opponent of Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the race.
President Felipe Calderón ' s sister did not seem to have applied for Governor Michoacán ' s seat during violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to win a race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fusto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader in the race for the seat of Governor of the Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderón in the radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... "they grabbed the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IDF.
IRP ran Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing for her return, and winning in Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only a little bit outrun by Calderón, who ran the ratings until election day.
Calderón, a candidate from the National Action Party, or PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DPR, which now belongs to the governor's chair, came third - a major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morell, denied links with drug traffickers and called on other candidates to accept the results.
In Michoacán, drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long dominated.
This is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
The PPD mayor was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderón, and several candidates came out of the local race for fear.
For IRP, however terrible the elections in Michoacán may look, victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who was supposed to represent IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year."
ADB is convincing Asia to help save the eurozone.
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, manager of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest growing big economies should "do what they can" to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc, either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties "inequitable" and said that Asian financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he reported to the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
Italy ' s debt has risen alarmingly in recent days, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe has created fears that it may again lead the world economy to recession, and has led to calls by the major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be channelled through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of bonds from the EU financial assistance fund, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided enormous power in the negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not possible, it's a condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warshny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to help Europe for the Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they'll find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 years of age and going to the sea for holidays, and it won't be well received," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ADB's forecast of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing "punitive risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "emergency plans" to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon's terrible warnings of potential reductions in defence spending
Defence Minister Leon Panetta set the scene on Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that further reductions of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress ' s inability to adopt a budget agreement and the resulting so-called secvester would trigger a total reduction of 23 per cent and the discontinuation of many new projects.
"Such a severe reduction, which has been applied so mindlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of the ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts at modernization," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our civilian workers and, since the reduction will take place so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civilian staff to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage our readiness."
The cuts will eventually affect the military, said Panetta.
"Though military funding in overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be seriously affected by severe disruption in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contractive personnel will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and the oversight contract that supports the troops."
"Statute staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted."
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of the sequester in the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We stand firm against this draconian action," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose on ourselves."
"Sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen."
Whether the Panetta letter or the senators' last warnings for a budget compromise or the calls for the Pentagon to be exempted from cuts will be reinforced later.
The Panetta was completely sincere about possible reductions, although he came to work in the Pentagon's leadership after years of budget reviews in Congress and the White House, realizing that he faced difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a sad picture of what could follow -- a force with a shell, but without a core.
"This is a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's a wing of a plane without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from an unstable spirit of battle, a bad readiness and inability to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely restricting our ability to be the first to deploy and respond everywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects might face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 attack fighter aircraft, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground war vehicle, which the Army and Marines need to replace the Hummer.
Cessation of F35's further development and testing can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and counter the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to catch a lie
A quick look at the last headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The administration of the University of Pennsylvania was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught when, with the microphone on, he told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes countries.
Congressman New York and Internet inhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by denying his delusions, which were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to conceal extramarital ties.
Again, no one who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton found lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The history of fraud in school and college exams is common.
There have been instances in which teachers have given students answers to tests in order to have a good evaluation of their performance.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Within one day, research shows that you can be lied 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study revealed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Identifying lies or proving lies is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, which is like, say, charades, where you have to say, "Gone!" the detection of lies is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most old myths about lies have been cleared.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
There is no reason to conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
An experienced unveiler of lies can reach the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimics, the structure of the questions, and the temporal characteristics.
I have spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel free to control their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women lie about others, usually to protect someone ' s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried (but the lies they say are most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First of all, watch your target's normal behavior.
It's called "defining the original state."
This helps to provide a starting point for measuring changes further.
Observe the position, the laughter, the vocal characteristics of your object.
Well, it would be good to know if a man is always kicking his feet in normal condition, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see a footbump in the middle of a meeting.
Next, search for groups of deceiving notes verbales and non-verbal actions.
Think of these groups as red flags, not as proof of deception.
Liars can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can set their feet towards the door, lean towards the door, change their position in a certain way, or show "facilitation after interview" -- a exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all complex questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interrogation signal to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at your object's speech.
It is known that Scott Patterson has erred and used the past time to claim that his murdered wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Perpetrators can also use distance in their speech: "I did not have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely understandable.
Someone can use "qualification language" when they answer a difficult question: "Well... the truth is... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer emotional rather than factual, and is often a red flag.
There's no magical means to detect lies, but it's possible to master the skill of detection.
These skills will increase everyone's chances of not falling victim to skilled crooks in their professional and private lives.
The disputed pipeline plan needs to be revised after the US threatens to delay approval
A few days after Obama ' s administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- causing union anger, but calming down environmentalists -- the company that is about to build the pipeline claims that it would be willing to reconsider the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and was confident that the project would still receive approval.
The company announced this decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official Alex Purbas says that the company remains confident that it will eventually receive approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This is following a statement by the State Department last week that it will postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ogalala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental impact assessment commissioned by the State Department is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the next year ' s elections, although the authorities denied that politics had been involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called the decision an appeal by the Department of State and expressed support for it.
An oil pipeline of 1,700 miles should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He must transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He's hated by environmentalists, but he loves trade unions who hope for about 20,000 jobs connected to the pipeline.
But Nebraska's legislators, opposed to the plan, are considering a bill to speed up movement from the Sand Hills and Ogallala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current Department of State environmental impact study had shown that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but the energy industry source had stated that the Department ' s auditor had commissioned a separate review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was not suitable because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly making the baby sick of fear.
The New York family claims that Patty LaBelle's disco diva started to riot in their lobby at their house in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to the point that she puked with fear.
Tirada of Lady Marmalade scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "a change of personality, sleep disorder " and "a strong fear of strangers," says her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10, last year, when the work scene Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "Do you know what your daughter's doing?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became furious and began to use swearing -- the word on C and the word on F -- on higher tones ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the baby's mother.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her companions had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so hard that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle an apology note but did not receive an answer.
Counsel and LaBelle's representatives do not answer the phone for comments.
The amount of compensation for the harm suffered is not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family was planning to contribute whatever money they received to the charity of children suffering from cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBelle answer for what he did," said Davis.
"Such behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate issues slowed the economy
During the first year of the reign of Mario López, unemployment and the illegal labour market rose in Sinaloa, foreign financing declined and the economy weakened.
The year 2011 - which will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the government of Mario López Valdes - is also called the year of change, which has given rise to great hopes for economic development, but, given the unfavourable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but there has been a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only resulted in millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy, causing a 3.6 per cent decline in overall economic activity in the first half of the year, largely due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by frost provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in their entirety and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and naut being the main crops damaged.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, between January and March 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, increased to 5.28% in the second quarter, and continued to rise to 6.19 per cent between July and September, a proportion equivalent to more than 74,000 unemployed Sinaloa residents, an increase of 18,969 from the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been dominated by many factors, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be attributed indirectly to actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law passed in Congress to combat money-laundering, because it is difficult for people who illegally own dollars to work with, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
López Cervantes said that there was a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state to seek work abroad has been limited in the U.S., primarily due to entry difficulties, and in the latter, because once they enter, they already face very many difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stays and requires jobs here in the state as a result of rising unemployment," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of Sinaloa ' s labour market is worse, given the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and malfeasance, another reminder of State employment is provided by low wages; the State has the lowest wages in the country, as recorded by the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers until September was 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, between January and July the state had $630,697 FDI, a decline of 87.74 per cent compared with $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment in the course of the year, which mainly came from the services sector.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July, during the state congress, approval for a 3 billion peso loan that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, with only 2,600 million pesos at the local level, and no debt advantage was expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business people, the first year of the government, Mario López Valdes, demonstrates a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, it has to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have failed to harmonize the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Deceleration of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as the early freezes this year had stopped the state's economy and its efficiency and growth had been limited.
"The low size of the economy is the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and therefore at the end of the year we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we found that we were working on it, we believe that there is a need to develop a long-term programme that will redefine the direction and economic direction of the state, and we need to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy style.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He is sentenced to 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years ' imprisonment and a 100-day fine were imposed on a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of an offence against health, was possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling Cypruso Valdes Street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white truck carrying a black bag in a car box and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was placed at the disposal of the Second District Court and the accused continues to be detained at the Legal Consequences of Crime Support Centre.
You have to contribute to the work.
Public works related to programmes such as the Motherland, the Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants run the risk of being incomplete or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although work programmes had been developed so far, they were at risk because the State Government was unable to make contributions amounting to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes amounted to approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State was required to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so that it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a piece from the beginning of July," he said, "to keep going, we've started work and they've made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that during the last year, during Jesús Aguilar Padilla's reign, the state had not made the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the term of office the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that had not been provided by the State administration in that case.
"It happened to us in the previous administration, because the state didn't have the financial capacity to participate, and programs continued to evolve, and this year, in order to access these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state has left," he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareala, to increase efforts to ensure that interest on them reached as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (HJ) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which postpones the so-called "transfer to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not obtained to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree detailing the actions to be taken in the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, constitutional claims filed by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains valid.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right established by law by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned therein regarding the introduction of digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a debate on the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive could not determine the general rules of the measure to be prepared by the public administration.
"I also do not believe that it would affect the autonomy of the regulator" and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas, such as telecommunications, is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the governance of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals - one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of digitization, which included meeting public needs, which had not only a technical dimension, "as it covered economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he said, "require the work of the whole system, which is founded on the principle of public economic administration, and includes a group of authorities which the Constitution unites in the executive branch of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting and had done so through the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of Congress, enforces the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere, he said.
In Michoacán, the ability to count "votes for voice" is being analysed.
According to data transmitted to the APPR, the difference between the first and second seats in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 minutes.
The possibility of counting "votes for the vote" is real with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where, according to data from the Provisional Electoral Results Programme, the difference between the first and second seats in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 records.
In this light, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lyanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, as the State Congress approved reforms shortly before their legal entry into force in the electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame specified in the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JJJJ) ruled on the constitutional claim submitted by the local legislature and declared the state representative's vote on constitutional reform to be "unauthorized and illegal," as he did not have the right to "permit or support them."
In an interview about the possibility of a "vote for voice" by Maria de los Angeles Lyanderal, she argued that, with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of the IMS, it would be possible to present a partial or full counting of votes by the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial count of one or more ballot boxes may be made under conditions that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of voting and counting in the ballot box or is not available to the chairman; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, the total counting of votes in all ballot boxes in the elections may occur when there is a indication that the difference between the proposed winner candidate and those who won the second ballot is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or the coalition that nominated the second candidate.
A total count of votes will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it is determined that the difference between the winner and the second-ranking candidate is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a petition from a political party whose candidate has taken second place, in the event that the ballot boxes, which were counted in part, are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case for the elections in Morelia, where, according to the UDPR, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16%, not even counting 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalnam, confirmed by his family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his home town on Sunday evening, and on Monday, an inspection and a resting mass were carried out.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last will was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sapalnam mountains.
After receiving condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital, Coahuila, on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, and the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during high school.
"His desire was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes be scattered in the mountains of Sapalnama, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot's sister, said.
In her view, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believed that he was at the height of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left the town of Saltillo very young to go to the Air College in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Basio remembers him as a very good man "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The boy recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to the Sapopan to attend the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
He's being escorted to the last path.
The gunshots were fired in honour of Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Cortez Basio of the Mexican Air Force, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, from the village and government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technical Secondary School in Saltillo, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress in both studies and sports, leading him to the last path.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he operated crashed, together with the provincial government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 6.05 p.m., Basio Cortez ' remains (created) from Saltillo arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, to the esplanade of the training school, where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at the NL Kaderate farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military had shown in the media 11 persons who had been detained in the same municipality for organized crime offences.
Three men were found shot dead in various parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereita Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was found on the 1.5 kilometre Cadereita road towards Santiago, on the highlands of a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people passing by noticed that the gate was open in a village house with a wall painted beige and brown.
When they looked inside, just three metres away, they found the bodies of three men, and immediately they informed the relevant authorities.
One man was wearing a yellow t-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
Nearly one metre, the body of another person was in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three lay face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no casings.
There are signs at the fence of a village house addressed by one organized criminal group to another, and there are several bullet holes at the gate as well.
11 captured in Kadreit
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Kadereit and who were accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret graves.
According to published information, eight persons were initially detained in Los Alvero colony on 11 November and one person who was taken hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding membership in a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., and military personnel made a patrol round in the village of Old Rancho in Kadreit, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the salon.
By stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, following these statements, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on the public soil of La Prand, who, when he saw the military, tried to escape.
He is charged with secret graves in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kaderate.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of an economic catastrophe.
The Italian Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of an economic catastrophe that has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President on Wednesday, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive branch will take up its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to escape this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to reporters.
Monty did not say explicitly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is well defined now," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy was struggling with the political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
At the heart of the pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets have set 10 years more than 7 per cent of Italy's BTP bonds, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said the reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centerist-right party.
Support for the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats who form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure to warn that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as youth and women ' s organizations, on Monday.
He's gonna finish his appointment on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, who allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy ' s debt was now at a critical level, given the uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister would succeed.
Saving Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only give him time to reform before new elections were appointed.
Monty said that he wanted to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should only be made of technical specialists, a sign of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement among parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more game experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players registered in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 declared players played 50 games.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica is when you compare the 22 players who were called by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the champions of the world and Europe, number one in FIFA's monthly rating, have a whole list of class A selection games, Tricolor only has a protector, Michael Uman, as the only one who has played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing in the League of All Stars and the Strong Clubs of the Premier League of England have been very active in the league and local cup competitions during the year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
Added to this is the experience of Spanish furry in difficult skills at the Euro or World Championships.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONACAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We see that he is leading the list in the Spanish Folkyper Iker Casillas, who, last Sunday against England (the 0-1 game in London) repeated the record of Andoni Subisarret, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, player of Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were declared the best last week by UEFA along with another player from the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and a bombardier from Shalke Raúl González with 102.
Nearly close to a hundred Carles Puyol games with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Injesta with 62, Sesk Fabregas with 61, and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, next to Michael Umana, left side junior Diaz with 48 matches and bombardier Brian Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only five have crossed the line of 30 games: Kaylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain were played by Gérard Pike (37), Sergio Busquetza (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 exits on the field, there's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murey with 23.
The rest of us didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games, and Hordi Alba has two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivar has only one, Alman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading player, David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres since 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought twice as many points as Carlos Hernández and three times as many as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet put the country on the 20th anniversary tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive Viva interview, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the band was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it is also a dream that has become a reality - to play in this country.
It was the statement of the bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America as part of the 20th anniversary tour and will be the only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20th.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group of Las Robertas.
It's a piece from a conversation that's completely deciphered online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is the dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask that because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, are great surfing places, that's how we learned about it, from people who like surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you made a grand show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan on doing in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
You're celebrating 20 years of your career on this tour.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We are happy with our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things are going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the grace?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group comes from the same city, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of Seattle's sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, musical roads have also been opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude to the word was difficult; but your success enabled you to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We care not to be on tour too long because it's easy to get into this big crowd game and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what you did without deciding to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and in the beginning, it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years, and we haven't released a single album until Andy's death.
There was a lot of disappointment, because it took so long, and most importantly, that we were still close friends with Bruce (Ferweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I heard a song or saw a picture, I thought about the incredible man Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so on.
It was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local group Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some videos, and it was a group that we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas can offer in person, and it must be very exciting.
Why do you always change words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's a question for Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he's using the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There's so many of them.
The first to come to my mind is Geser Butler, John Entvisle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grandge relevant, even though he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling some distance from the word gringe.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and everyone that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are some songs in the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little positive.
Both, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and those songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and there's been some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the government hospital, and his family doctor informed him to examine the loss of muscle in his legs.
Fujimori, aged 72, who was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which caused him to operate four times and to be monitored.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of power in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He suffered four language cancers, lost 18 kilograms in weight, and other diseases, such as severe erosion gastrititis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and leg circulation problems, were listed by a doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for the murder of 25 persons by forces of the army destruction squad, which had been operating in secret during the early years of his reign.
Muhika goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by the President of Uruguay, José Muhica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will be visiting Mexico on this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important point in the extensive schedule of meetings with political, commercial authorities and the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara would be "friendly for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations," as the South American leadership had published on its website.
According to local media, Muhica is seeking support from Calderón for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannet.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens, a statement that prompted Uruguay ' s protest and withdrawal for consultation by his ambassador in a European country.
Mexico has been chairing, since November, G20, a group composed of the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, had an agreement with South American countries since January this year on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave this "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn from countries that do not benefit from international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
A weed plumber will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought relentlessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil foot of Bouzer, but never before did he do it in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The publication, which will be available in stores around the world this month, is based on the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows for three dimensions to be played without having to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to report on how stereoscopy will work without glasses," said the head of the press service of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game specially designed under this platform," because until now successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
Nintendo's representative stated that despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was an "accessible" video game that allowed us to enjoy a quick and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "second round" to the levels of the game, which this time are more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but on which it is necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not yield to optical illusions."
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo wins the series fans and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the mustache plumber needs to walk through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as Luigi's "player."
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun so that he would respond in the United States to a plot to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which requested Portillo to be extradited to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that, during his mandate, he had not "handled" legal decisions and had taken all the extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Together with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What had been done by Colom demonstrated the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the former Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (COP), Portillo will be extradited once, with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the Q120 million waste at the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was the pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people who are socially excluded have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added to this.
The anniversary was the result of a ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove was born next to Trinitat Vela in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of employment and drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday ' s celebration at Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
The different political perceptions during the elections revealed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the Chairman of the General, Arthur Masa, and his predecessor, Hordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by the ex-consultant of the Socialist entity, Ernest Maragal, and ex-leutant of the mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council, Ricardo Goma.
He also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Clerice, and the Social Work SEO of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and of the settlement of hope among people in difficulty.
"Crisis isn't new to the organization and the work done to her," he said.
The occupied building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday at noon without a fight.
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living in house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday afternoon, which they had illegally occupied, and where they had organized mass parties, which annoyed neighbours, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there's gonna be a security check," said the manager.
The squatters, who captured 11 of the 13 floors of the building, were inhabited, embezzled all electricity and water, painted walls, and left traces of various kinds, especially liquor cans.
The first three floors were mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
There is a nightclub, Balmes 51, just outside the building, which also suffered damage.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income had fallen by 80%.
The club owner says the invaders dragged her into an unfair competition because they were selling drinks for three euros, while they were selling drinks for ten.
Moreover, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the neighbors ' complaints about the noise, although she noticed that the noise was not caused by the club ' s visitors, but by the squat ' s residents and, above all, by those who had attended the parties that had been organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbours had said.
The club owner said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he has "forgiven" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week "to evacuate the building immediately in order to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit among neighbours and degradation in this area."
A popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them had been hacked.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building."
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 P.D. went to Montral Street, 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition after a debate on contributions
The 16-door municipal contest resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now extinct Barcelona Capital Corporation (BBC), this administration was printing promo-leafs for Colserola.
The bouquet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took a place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is not north-south but up (horra) -down (sea).
Positioning Colserola as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yogi's bear.
That was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 contests for many other gates at Colserola.
The gate is the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is Colserol, the park or the mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their influence on the city, are the subject of discussion among all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most recurring subject discussed when two members of this elected clan recognize each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to just one of the few similarities between what the three architects of Barcelona say and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the coastline has been reached, it becomes necessary to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildephon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We have to assume that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserols are more complicated," says the architect, for whom the title of Colserola's "turn" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them as "the entrance to the park, but as limiting certain areas where we should act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal a "intellectual task" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from the "uncertainity of public space forecasting" following the experiences of the 1980s, which ended on the Forum's "swan song" site.
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," meaning a transition.
"We must think of new urban planning tools because the current [for the Capital Master Plan (GSP) ] can lead to real trouble."
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colcerola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical question.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside Calcerola, which "should not be missed," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor's office offers his profession to enter the project "from the beginning."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is something that should lead multidisciplinary teams ("success," he argues), which should have created: "Architects should only be an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the title of this part is complex, because the competition's rules lack a general view of Colserola: "Sixteen cross-competing competitions have been declared, " he says - in terms of the sea-horse, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes it necessary, at least in his case, to choose 16 contests.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can be intersected by a program and definition with a project of an architect for the neighbouring gate.
From your point of view, the board has to guarantee that the stripe directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasbal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative of Red Casino pardoned the brother of Mayor Monterrey in a trial against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino has pardoned him before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting the extortion proceedings against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos alleging that Manuel Jonas had asked him to pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor ' s brother and, on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Crimes, he was transferred to a temporary prison located in the old part of the State capital.
He remained there for 49 days, following a second ban on displacement order, after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaderate for allegedly extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a medium degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving at San Nicholas Municipal Prison in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence of Jonas' guilt, such as charging 1.5 million pesos to bookkeepers in exchange for permission to operate.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to seek pardons for his brother, the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the trial, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez if he had redressed the damage and which of the partners of the gambling house gave a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give a name.
Based on the record of 197/2011, a lawful pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements can be made thereafter about the process planned against him; nor will any reparation or punishment be required.
After a hearing of the bookie's legal representative, at almost 3:50 p.m., it was ordered that Larrasabal Breton be released immediately.
A court official, Jorge Yanes, went to San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonas that he was legally forgiven and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionicio Pérez Hácomé describes the details of the disaster in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MOT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others were killed had shown that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in complete integrity, without attempting an emergency landing by the pilot.
During a press conference, Dionicio Pérez Hácomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot had discovered that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the vessel had several contact with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees 25 metres away from the fluid."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, thus meeting the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of impact did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
"The study reports that elsewhere there are no components of the vessel, and the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the corresponding requirements for the transport of passengers.
The land in this place has a gradient of seven to 30 degrees.
By now, the secretary said, the most important thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, a presidential helicopter was driving at cruise speed and that it had occurred on soft, rising soil.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, the owner of SCT, Pérez Hacomé, listed six important elements of the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was performed by visual flight rules, which means that the crew must be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed to the border between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Routes selected:
It is possible that due to cloud conditions, the team was searching for a lower height and greater visibility in the Quernavaca Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the radar of the aircraft are likely to be consistent before the impact with no loss of control or change of direction.
Broken debris in a small area:
The information available to date indicates that the front and the side lines were hit.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter encountered the ground in an environment of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the area of disaster, undetected evidence remains in the wreckage of the vessel, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies have shown that there may have been multiple contact with land.
During the field work, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, with a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful study, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found in more territory than the designated area near the site of the disaster, thus reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in a structurally integrated environment.
MSS announces an obese gene search program
Social protection leads research on obesity genes in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Protection Institute (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect obesity genes in children and young people, known as the "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Teenage" protocol, which would provide a calculation of signs of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre for the Twenty-first Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (written or not) to participate in MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where tests with children will be conducted from 8 a.m. every Saturday.
He stressed that the protocol had been launched at the Kuautemoke Sports Centre (west of the State of Mexico) and that since 8 October, the events had been held at the Nessaualkoyotl Sports Centre (east of the State of Mexico).
Once the target of 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (northern Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, World Diabetes Day will be celebrated and the main objective will be to bring together 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with the permission of parents and under their supervision to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that anthropometric measurements would be made on Saturday for all participants (weight, height and waist), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in just six years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent were obese, in the case of girls, 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there has also been a significant increase," a MSSI specialist said.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that, on average, Mexicans were 65 per cent descendants of American Indians, 30 per cent descendants of Europeans and 5 per cent descendants of Africans, a condition that affected genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main result of obesity genetics is the body ' s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is delayed in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (s) and forearms means the probability of metabolism or even prediabetism.
The information is treated with all confidentiality, and the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the dimensions and changes in lifestyle that must be made to avoid illness.
Cruz López explained that there were three main causes that caused overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyles, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of television and using transportation at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased consumption of sweet beverage and carbs (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition analysed in the program.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Department, developed a polymer-modified batum to produce a mixture of best quality, environmentally and temperature resistant.
If the signals sent by the road surface were to be addressed, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 yams for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Naher, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the asphalt road surface is normal, the number of pits may be reduced or reduced to zero.
His lecture on the technology view of the pits of the International Year of Chemistry reported that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing a polymer-modified batum to produce a mixture of characteristics close to the bitumen, but with the best resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Naher said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some towns in the north, to improve road quality and thus to resist the formation of pits.
He explained that the bitumen, the heaviest part of the oil, was the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some were the high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others were the low molecular mass called the Maltese, which together gave road cover to its characteristic viscosity.
The viscosity of the bitumen is the fact that he behaves like a liquid at about 180 degrees at high temperatures, his viscosity is very high at 120 degrees Celsius, and at 50 degrees Celsius he retains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not permanent, but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, as said by a chemical engineer.
The chimphaka noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the highest layers is a bitumen made of small stones, which are dropped into a bitumen and then crushed.
Every stone that makes this coating, he said, is buried in a bitumen.
When vehicles are moved and forces are applied, this helps the force to be very well distributed on the road.
If it was a modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added, the last layer, called the obsolescence layer, which is made of a small stone, actually sand, also submerged in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these forces, the deterioration layer also requires appropriate thickness and the material from which it is manufactured must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, were also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it significantly affected asphalt.
When the earth is wet, the water enters the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes the softening of all layers of the surface and thus the formation of the pits.
When the pits were formed, he said, the first layer of wear was worn out and only then it affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur instantaneously, a process that should be taken into account in the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the surface must always be related to the transport load and must be guaranteed to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Raphael Herrera said that there is still much to learn about the bitumen and, for example, bitumen emulsions that in other countries are already on the market and even helping to fix pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What was it that wasn't enough for the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Cerna Melina Ramirez from getting Miss Colombia's crown.
Valé's representative won the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca only wants to have Miss Columbia's crown.
This time Melina Ramirez Cerna was supposed to be content to be on the winner's runway with a silver crown and a ribbon declaring her the new Princess of Colombia.
Based on the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department has 14 crown princesses and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown but were declared princess, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Ever (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hiseye Alhure Garcés (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Alhure (2008).
The question that many people are asking is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favourite who, in each of the performances, demonstrated that she had everything to become the new Miss Colombia, for a reason, she was elected Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue - titles held by the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to grant her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to provide a convincing answer to the question "What book characterizes you and why?," commissioned by Martin Murilla Gómez of the literary society.
She said to the man who asked:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of multiculturalism, and I definitely think that the book that describes my childhood - "The Little Prince" - is quite a deep book.
Today, I read Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; and at this moment, I am reading the book of Irina Nemirov, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called Blood Fries.
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the quoted books described it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "The universe is wise, what is about to happen is happening. '
And all of you, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses that were put forward, Valle was burned by favouritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because she was preferred, she had been met with ovas, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, triggered stress on the Queen, and as a consequence she did not stare on the stage."
And it was marked during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during her two appearances at the evening coronation.
While she looked confident in both, she was clearly lacking the strength and energy shown by Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on RCN, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "has meant that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become queen."
In addition, Valé ' s representative had recently avoided communicating with the press, and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Vale's representative failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why, two days before the election, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty isn't enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look not only at the looks, but also focus on the public mind, before they take part in the contest, they should be involved in the projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that Valé's representative committed defects on the buttocks and fibrosis seen on her belly, but this is controversial, since the jury specifically marked her as a candidate with "natural beauty," taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernán Orosco's consultant notes that Melina didn't have the best body that was "but the problems of fibrosis on her stomach, which weren't very visible to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but Mrs. Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize that was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the brutal prediction came to pass last night, they say it was the uncle whom Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting the crown.
Whether or not, the fact is that Melina's year of government is beginning today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions that the organizers of the National Competition have indicated directly.
However, she will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Kano's body.
The Cali CSI Forensics went back to history as the man who confirmed Alfonso Kano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Kano in a comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics officers this week, it was Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehad, who spent 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Chocó, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and stools.
During the week of Elizar's I.D. operation, a man known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Cauca to Palmir.
He knew that he would need to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the study group at the place where the body was located, he did not identify it by its appearance; it was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed as a local farmer, with no glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using increased glass, ink, spatula and lantern, Elisar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the photos.
His eyes did not fail; it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, a representative of Puerto Texas was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the leader of FARC.
Fingerprint search
The confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González at a press conference about the operation against Cano was particularly significant for a dental specialist of Sijin from Cali.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the dentists participate in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and identify the detainees.
Many criminals in detention have forged identity cards or are undocumented.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the event of a theft, he had to take a piece of the wall home because in that place the thief had to rely on his hands to possess a safe full of jewels and money.
"It's hard to work with walls because they're not convenient surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who took part in several thefts," he says.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with liquor bottles around him.
During the investigation, it was established that a relative might have been suspected of having committed the crime and, indeed, the fingerprints on the bottle matched.
Although it doesn't guarantee he was a murderer, it proves he was at the scene of the murder.
A dentist from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent was being applied to print sites.
When they appear, a scapula or ribbon is used to remove them.
The fingerprints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just like not all the gold that glitters, not everything that you touch leaves prints on you.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
"Indignant people" challenge the New York authorities.
Hundreds of protesters set up a camp in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court ' s decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and went to the park next door.
Members of the Grab Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn while attempting to take over another Grand Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near Zukotti Square, where they wanted to get to, thanks to a court order that allowed "happy people" to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded by seizing the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made
"Our idea is that since the court won't allow us to camp in the square, we'll camp somewhere else and continue the court struggle to return to Zukotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said one of the Wall Street forces, Mark Bray.
Brey explained that the response of "happy people" to the evacuation of the tent town, ordered personally by the Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, went to the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the angry people began to seize a new park, located at the junction of Central Streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and an owned parish of Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could have occupied the place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but said Efe had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where a delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for the movement by trying to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, Zukotti Square, which is private property, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will review the legality of this morning ' s dispersal of protesters.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of that judgement at the same time, and even provided copies to the police guarding the square, leading to "some small clashes," said Bray, who said that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Gray Wall Street movement and from enforcing "laws that were issued after the seizure began, or from preventing demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws prevented them from deploying tent stores and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zukotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "breached the law."
Bloomberg said that he had ordered the area to be cleared because it had become "a place where people had come not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others," because "some businesses had received threats" and neighbours feared "a deterioration in the quality of life."
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that, deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who condemns the mayor for "disrespect for freedom of speech."
The forces responsible for taking over Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize "granial actions" on Thursday, in collaboration with civil society organizations and trade unions, in order to recall the last two months of the protests that had begun on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bouble and other outstanding Canadians, she will appear on the television programme "Rassel Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian woman, Pamela Anderson, was Tim Allen's assistant in "Big Repair," rescue worker at the Malibu Saviors, Bunny in Playboy, wife of a rock musician, Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the ballad artist Michael Bouble and other outstanding Canadians, will appear on the 1st December of December of "Rassel Peters Christmas," as a very special Mary.
CTV presented a television show today in which Anderson, also known for her online home-based pornographic video, appeared along with her then husband, drummer Tommy Lee of "Mötley Crüe" Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in crèches depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently appeared as the host of the tour "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show CTV features a Canadian Buble singer who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March to the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato, who also knows the meaning of scandals.
Bubble recently called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Resurrected from the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent as a result of domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the rising sun has experienced since World War II.
According to the Tokyo government's first estimate, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million - a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive lost quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in annual terms.
Recorded in the second quarter, Japan's fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate between January and March 2010.
The recovery can partly be attributed to the revival of the purchase of machinery for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1% against the 0.9% reduction in capital costs that was observed between January and March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly due to household consumption, which now stands at 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure increased by 1 per cent as a result of increased costs of cars, travel and recreation.
The brand of yen
Tokyo provided to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "currency-assholes" chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro-zone debt crisis and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that pushes, like a stone, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Soni, for example, blame yen for their low performances between July and September.
As long as markets continue to be besieged by peripheral EU countries, Yeshihiko Noda's government does not reduce vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said yesterday, Minister of Economic Policy, Motohis Furukawa.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of economic decline in September.
An indicator that predicts changes in the global economy has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points after it hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Once again gives rise to doubt
Papadimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign a single written undertaking.
With peripheral premiums for risk and uncertainty prevailing in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the labyrinth that leads to a solution to the large European debt crisis.
The feeling that Ellada's "consent" of the new transitional government is imposed by Brussels's demands rather than by the true conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, the leader of the conservative party, New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for a new election scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, as Papadimos said yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will conclude tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 employment programmes, reform of the civil service disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: "We are ready to help the transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
The conservative leader took one step more in his mood for the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should unfreeze the 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of acceptance.
But the European Commission, still pissed off at the effect of the Papandreu referendum's all-or-nothing style, reiterated yesterday that its demands were clear: it would not resume aid unless the new Greek government and the leaders of the main parties signed a "written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible."
A representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafai, said that the three inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date had not yet been set.
There's plenty of thread in the Greek straw for a while.
Ms. Sophia: "These are the tools of progress and hope."
The Queen stressed Spain's "main" position with regard to this type of finance.
Spain has "been a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country had become the second largest donor to the instruments of cooperation whose "value" she said was that it was "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind, based on faith in people."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt that such action is "really necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially with the goal of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day - the level at which the poverty line is fixed."
Spain is still working to expand the network of recipients around the world and is taking on this task with all the "responsibility," says Donya Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, "the main recipients of these loans."
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes "two basic objectives."
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that, by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that a hundred million of those households would emerge from the poverty into which they were living.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "has been on the path begun years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted by Ms. Sofia as "an act of justice and recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as "a depraved idealist in the global fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to examine his lending policy on the ground.
A year later, this experience was replicated by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continued development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project yesterday gave her the title of "heads of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the poor bank.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by encouraging participants to participate in the debate and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity was an "ethical imperative" for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to the times of the economic boom, as it was a "permanent commitment."
Jimenez concluded that microcredit was "a serious and firm course aimed at eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to cost reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the "success" of giving "assurance" to people who were "opened," and the mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, which "opens its doors in a spirit of solidarity."
HDZ proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage
On Monday, 14 November, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Congress was held in Leipzig without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not originally planned for the program, but came in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with Greece and perhaps tomorrow with Italy...
The draft resolution on the chairmanship of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The stand-ups that lasted a few minutes, which deserved their performances by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Scheuble, the Eurofil and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main message of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less than Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible for the European Union to exercise greater control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "to give Europe a face."
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schöible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will accept this decision quickly; Britain opposes it, and HDZ leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is against it too.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, delegates by an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal to weigh the voice of each EU member country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in his party, the Chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kol, but she has not sought to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in distress that like to criticize "high-profile" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes a whole paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just a passing pass.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's a sick-leaf fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government started an offensive on the sick lists.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will come to Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefits Fund and to give a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And in order to help this offensive, which arose out of a desire to save itself in a difficult situation, but also part of a campaign of right-wing re-elections, most want to focus on sick lists.
First of all, in view of budgetary savings, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private employees before the payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the employer ' s special consent, the ill worker will lose his/her salary for four days equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, i.e. imposing one day on public servants without sickness benefits (public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of benefits, as opposed to three days for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority is also raising the issue of fraud again, with regard to the abuse of hospital records.
Control will become more severe and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have illegally received," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the impact of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick records.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subject to constant monitoring and political attacks, which have borne fruit.
People in France are as sick as anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the figures for the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than Euro237 million of daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensatory expenditures in 2008 amounting to 11.3 million euros represented 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to Euro6.2 million.
And so, it accounted for 2.5 percent of health-related expenses.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic, which masks certain deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, revealed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said that they had not taken a single day of hospital.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days to one month, 15 per cent of one to three months and 11 per cent of hospitals lasted longer.
By comparing these figures with those of European neighbors, French workers are no more likely to take hospital care than any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers revealed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall percentage of absences in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of sick leave fraud is very low compared to "grey" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in a systematic review of the hospital ' s duration of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term findings were "unjustified" or too long," or 37,050.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unreasonable," which is 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were "unjustified" for several million employees who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, the "grey" of employment.
According to UMP member Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, they amount to between Euro9 million and Euro15,000 of the shortfall in budgetary revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos announced this on Monday, 14 November, in Parliament, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out that task.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement opening the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
He added that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "core task" of the new Government, since the country's presence in the Eurozone was "at stake," he said.
Accordingly, Papadimos projects a reduction in the country's budget deficit "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects the Measures of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We won't vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's deputies New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impeded economic recovery.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner for Economy and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, said Antonio Samaras that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide must be legalized with outside assistance, the committee of experts states.
Canadians are denied death, as claimed in the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, not including cancer cases.
Canadians are being denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee suggests that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow suicide with aid and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic and Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death."
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in a hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in a hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance, the report concludes that it contradicts the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization results in abuse of use, i.e. the commission of euthanasia or suicide with aid against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with aid is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia, because according to the 2010 Angus Reid survey, they believe that this will make it possible for people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that it is not an offence to legally terminate medical care.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained to respect the rejection of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, an expert on health legislation, described the "extreme" position of the experts who had signed the report because, among other things, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired and over 18 years of age can ask for help in committing suicide, says Mr. Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place individual independence above all other values that formed the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, also expresses "a strong disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called "manifest for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report's findings regarding abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with aid are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Al-Assad to give up power.
Damascus condemns the "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Al-Assad ' s supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria, Bashar Al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, resists him and condemns the "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria ' s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Syria ' s neighbours, Turkey and Jordan, supported the resignation of President Al-Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday to call upon President Bashar Al-Assad to relinquish power in Syria, where some 40 more civilians and members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed.
"If Bashar were to care for the interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the King of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview with BBC.
In turn, the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, regretted that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had failed.
Those in the Middle East who did not live in peace with their people and could not satisfy their aspirations would lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey was taking an increasingly harsh course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "enhancement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly harsher course with regard to the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces were killed in the Dar ' a area in southern Syria, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed in an exchange of fire and heavy machine-gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was nearing the end of the crisis."
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was "a dangerous step."
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying "the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the operationalization of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, also called for the dispatch of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into "paranoia."
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to end the crisis adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the fighting towns and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov referred yesterday to the "irregular" decision of the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and Italian victims.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for some time to form his team and execute a program that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's reign.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a victim-intensive programme, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions following the meeting with the Prime Minister's candidate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask the Parliament to vote on trust before Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monty ' s submission of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Jorge Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bond holders yesterday, asking for time.
"Democracy requires time to prepare a government and a programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understood."
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "policies."
The new Government would have to operate until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranco Fini, the new Government will receive a vote of confidence from Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that when he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important actor in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Rehn, stressed that "in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet the planned budget for 2013, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had demanded, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss, Emma Marchegalla, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that is not growing cannot meet the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as a European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change of the era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism," a "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "the other Italy," according to the authors of the editorials.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as by April 2012, Italy had to pay 200,000 million euros of public debt.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, confirmed on Monday a United States agency specializing in nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of that United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possibly military aspect" of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934 and worked for 30 years, "beginning in the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds with explosives."
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to set up a company producing nanoalmaz in Kiev.
His company ' s financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, the IAEA refers to "the clear indications that Iran's development" of the nuclear detonator system "was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear programme."
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or remained unchanged during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in attacks against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of religious crimes.
According to the FBI, the total number of hate crimes increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, as highlighted by Human Rights First, "an increase in the incidence of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," adding the organization to the official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered serious human rights violations," added Paul Lejandre, a leader of the organization.
"The American Government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
"Hate crimes" in federal law is the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook.
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed its platform to allow users to see, inter alia, the activity of those they're watching, which makes the service similar to Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "name" tab allows you to follow more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters," Internet users, whose messages ("tweets") you're tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This provides an opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a low percentage of users in August" before being made available online on Monday, and announced to AFP that Caroline Penner would make a Twitter press secret.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather vague, and as using rather vague terms (RT to stop someone else's communication, #followfriday to guide the tracking of other users), largely with the pleasure of experienced users, opens itself up to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the web, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive, and it reminds me too much of Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, writing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Incorporation of the "Golden Rule" budget into the Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget "gold rule" into the constitution in order to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction by the credit rating agencies of Austria (triple A).
Chancellor Werner Feimann personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with an Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60 per cent set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand million euros more each year, citing the argument of Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Schpindelegger.
Thus, Austria is meeting the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of State or Government demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The regulation adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the "German model," since Germany was the first European country to adopt the "rule."
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the State budget of the federal State in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the land, like the communes, should be presented with balanced budgets.
The goal is to get public debt to fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Yoshihiko Noda
Threatening new intervention in the currency market
Prime Minister Yeshihiko Noda of Japan warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would launch new interventions in the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the exchange rate of the yen to be excessive, explained to Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to almost a historical point that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new power record since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the buying of investors who perceive it as "as a refuge" in these dark times of global economic decline and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that prompted the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currency harms Japanese exports by making Japanese products more expensive and reducing Japanese firms ' income from abroad when converted to national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild itself" following the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile foetus of reconstruction.
The world ' s third largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time per year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect "the fundamental economic performance of Japan."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi's deputy agency manager warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps" to make it clear that no further easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the emitting organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros) the purchase of treasury bonds by raising to 55,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) the ceiling it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to satisfy the stock market.
Eurozone
Rates are rising, stock exchanges are swinging
The risk of exposure to the debt crisis is undermined by European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the eurozone's stability, European exchanges went a little further to the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
Owing to the new difficulties faced by eurozone countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"The concerned investors are just too worried about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop in new market doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its eyes on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow change until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsusige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
It's a return to concern about the future of the eurozone, hitting a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3,570, falling by 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the congress of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ's party on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain alarming.
This morning, on Tuesday, Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and Spanish bonds with the same maturities reached 6.2%.
These interest rate difficulties in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked for time from the exchanges to restore the situation in Italy, which was under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "core task" of his Government.
Spain was shot at in front of the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates on Germany ' s and Spain ' s 10-year debt reached a new historic peak.
Waiting for growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded an economic growth rate of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent due to increased household consumption.
Insee, despite this, revised downwards the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the beliefs
If there is a theme that cannot be decided after short discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is an energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are becoming an occasion to reflect on the share and location of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and sound data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear power, or of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, China, India and Brazil are only a few of those who have pursued their projects with determination.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one installation to its kit by resuming the construction of the plant, which had been interrupted by the accident on Tri Mile Island.
Although the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, an increase in the demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, and an increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Champion, from which she receives 30% of his electricity, is also the largest coal and gas consumer due to the intermittent wind; hence, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher respectively than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a high cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the country ' s new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is all the more so because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts an array of specialized international trade-related small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be relocated to another industry.
If France were to abandon nuclear power, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these facilities and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electric engineer would order an EPR calculated to work for 60 years if its manufacturer was scheduled to close down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilic sources of energy production.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the inexcusable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it has learned from the two previous ones.
The benefits of this step and of cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, present a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is viewed by all energy professionals wishing to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, paving the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, beliefs and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various fronts - overburdening police, judicial and administrative services, subordinated to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "human rights State."
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior ("Liberación" of 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters."
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and left agree in many ways on this matter.
On the right hand side, Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers," and on the left, Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "can't accept the world's poor."
The difference in generosity only
In 2005, the horde of a Polish plumber felt the fear of invasion of the country both on the left and on the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they will show towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confined himself to platitudes, saying that "joint work will solve our immigration problem."
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may give an electoral advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book presenting recent immigration data (Special People: How Migration shaped our world and shapes our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration reduces growth and employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the perception that they are capable of replacing local workers, especially those with low qualifications, by causing wage cuts.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than replace local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive Impact on Wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant workers results in a positive impact on the salaries of local workers.
Giovanni Peri estimated that an increase of 1% of the migration flow leads to an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent in real long-term wages.
This does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (the United States Nobel Prize winners include a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net profits in social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization estimates, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net return (income minus expenditure) on average Euro150,000 to the State budget for his/her life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was about to catch up with the missing growth points.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to scare off immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, in the twentieth century it suffered the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some felt that if democracy was to finally prevail over its enemies, it would suffice to organize a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, the Little has known that it comes from the superficiality of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be a "repression instrument," as Etienne Wasro, a Republican philosopher, once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodia of a truthful Greek referendum will have a dual revealing effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, according to many, Republican soldiers are now kissing the wrong way.
We will not win by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart blanche" for an absolute European monarch, or jumping with bound legs into the chasm of nationalism - what a citizen's choice!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of a shared, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and there are no known how many more, because there is only one crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is completely subordinate to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is completely humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The administration of the European project must be restored to popular sovereignty as a matter of urgency.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets, and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A solution to the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delort, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But imagining it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has led to the realization of the country, is yet another madness and a new impasse.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to build Republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine people ' s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more.
The world chip card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpent, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11% growth in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM cards), exceeding 6,000 million units according to Eurosmart.
Most important is the non-contact technology sector, which allows the payment of public transportation or purchases by simply having a map over a reader.
This year, the world will sell 460 million non-contact chip cards, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (with 580 million expected) to nearly 10 per cent of the world's chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, long behind Asia and the Pacific, is now moving forward in the area of contact-free payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function, and 75,000 terminals accept it.
France is starting from a more modest position, with 400,000 contactless Visa maps in circulation.
But big shops are picking up speed.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard.
To move to a higher speed, banks need to be equipped with their customers.
"Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactable bank cards to their clients in the future," reported Gérard Nebui, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the future of the means of payment, that is, the mobile phone.
So far, few machines have been equipped with NFC technology (Communication of the Near Field) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they have to really fly next year."
"We're counting on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012, " explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Kane.
The iPhone equipment of approximately 200 clients and staff will be provided with cheques to ensure non-contiguous payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also stated yesterday that he was preparing to launch a market offer that would allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-sought links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algerians were now confident.
"The tool used by the two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have reached similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French nationals in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the following day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone SIM cards belonging to terrorists.
Axis of terror
An analysis of the calls revealed several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who has lived for a long time in Maidiguri, a town in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram cradle, and the other is said to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but certainly we must wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now putting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened and uninterested people.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri, under a mosque, school and imam fundamentalist, Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict observance of the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against a wicked central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, committing numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead behind.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the cult radicalizes and goes beyond its northern turf.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In Abuja in June, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which flows from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
Today, as Aqmi strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from Al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, in an interview with the Presidents, Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and offered to share all available information.
The world, as Republican presidential candidates see it.
With regard to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by crisis, lead a complex world with simple and, more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters would believe that.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have multiplied the loud but undecided foreign policy statements that have traditionally been the strength of Republicans.
China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often confused with each other.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of being nominated by the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese in the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, annoyed by the migration of entire industries into Asia.
Worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Obama's ambassador to China, and the only candidate who understands complex foreign policy, has not been able to overcome a position that encourages emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current Obama position).
But Huntsman, who's holding up at the bottom of the ratings, has remained unheard.
Reagan style.
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of not honouring promises to that partner.
Businessman Herman Kane, second in the ranks of candidates, showed a discouraging lack of knowledge of the cases.
He recently called for China's military threat to be countered because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power - apparently not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
It is also recommended that Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman should seek torture of suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009.
All this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower the tone of the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of "boys" from Iraq, his ruses in Libya, which have brought him the reputation of weak politics.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The population believes that the balance of national security under Obama has been positive and has eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are stuck in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Pot flow, new gates for Russian gas entry into Europe.
The northern pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly below the Baltic Sea was launched.
It is designed to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the banks of the Baltic, between the orchestra's performance and the fine snacks, in the opening of the North River, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Marth Rütte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will provide 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas each year to Western Europe through the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the Leningrad region to the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
The possibility of constructing a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Flood will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Flood with the new German-Soviet Pact, implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security for its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us," argued François Fillon, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All of this explains the big smiles on the faces of Gazprom heads, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas arrival point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technological feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel trapped in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left behind since the Second World War.
"A hundred needed to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the media secretary of North Potato.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel towers, without ruptures throughout its length, without valves, and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian state-owned company would live on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll shut down the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So, in case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to be the designers who designed stitches that only leak once every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot, which pulls the ship, for external surveillance, as well as by a machine circulating inside the gas pipeline.
A cigar-like apparatus shall be injected into a pipe of 1 metre diameter and pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at 3 meters per second, he gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any repair.
The circulation of the gas is due only to its pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies joined forces to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies established a joint venture called the North Flood, which was charged with the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are located in Zuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for 20 years, with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, no matter how much gas is actually transported," says Jens Muller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be €7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they'll take their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline flows from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to a sandbank planted by coniferous trees.
Ventils of 4.5 meters high form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It's gonna be 3 million an hour at full capacity, and in 2012, it's gonna be 6 million.
Moleskine's notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring the taste back to the letter.
He's got the aroma of adventures, hours spent behind a letter in the light of candles.
Moleskine's notebook is easy to recognize on a rectangled black cover, on rubber, on yellow and white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, Moleskine's notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Modo Modo, an Italian company based in Milan, decided to sell designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production machine, a moleskin - laced cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine adapted to today's taste to the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for the vanguard artists until the 20th century," told Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of the Modo Modo brand.
Success has come.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million.
We have gone far from producing the first years of production, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to get a profile of a typical buyer because the notebook attracts a businessman, a student, and a man in a free profession alike.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks at Fnac bookshops, shops in small city centres, and has become widely known.
"We have followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter despite the emergence of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural feature is accompanied by Moleskine's development; the brand recently organized an exhibition called "The Outroad," where architects and artists showed their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a leopard painting cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of his success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and brands include all kinds of support.
The success that created envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which recorded a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for the disabled begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice the average, i.e. 19 per cent as against 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
"No," stresses Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for the disabled."
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was three times higher than 2."
"But there's still a lot of work ahead of us."
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for a disabled person.
Among them, 37 per cent are older than 50 (17 per cent on average).
Their qualifications are rather low: 80 per cent have no bachelor ' s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very high, accounting for 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and are at the heart of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire a disabled worker.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentalities that change, but are too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association on behalf of Cité revealed that the managers interviewed had little knowledge of disability and "gived themselves complete persons in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled persons."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of disabled workers as set out in the 1987 Act.
The most recent known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agef, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with the law.
Evidence: The number of "taxable" organizations, like the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million euros to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which raised the tax, put a lot of pressure on the company," Pierre Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects increased consciousness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to data from the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, as against 82 per cent of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday night (20.45 p.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they enjoyed from this friendly match.
We're not gonna make it to the point that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
While sitting next to the arena of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar made peace.
Five months after the attacker's attack against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his advancement and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to move on," said player Lille.
As far as the contrast between his achievements at the club and his team is concerned, it's one whole, he's justified.
"I'm in Lille all year round, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn my glasses."
Kept in reserve, in advance of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to Saint Denis to finally shine.
Not forgetting, however, the notion of "pleasure."
He supported the Blue since the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 campaigns.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially that Mathieu (Debyushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Ramy) are on the other side, " he recalls.
"We just crossed paths."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered "glorious."
Pride to play in a party match.
Pride also claims, as a "neighbor," that France "re-established a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Niezna.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, admired by him.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the tech athlete will fly on the same plane with the blue leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see this in future games, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal, Paulo Bentou, is starting a retaliatory match against Bosnia (22.00 p.m.) on this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bentou already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt that the Collection, which he has been running since September 2010, is classified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a match to play and a Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in Hell of Zenica, it's clear the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the goal that would calm it.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk."
But in their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident that they will pass, in front of a public that should be thrilled, although the match will be very tense," said optimistic but reasonable Bent.
"We're expecting a very intense match, but we're convinced we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of getting to the Euro 2012, "and the successor of Carlos Ceiros spoke up.
A tie on Friday in a match against Bosnia requires Portuguese to win.
No one could have made Bosniacs.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk, " regrets Bent.
"We're gonna play against a team with a lot of technical merit and players with many individual merits," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think about it."
It's a good idea to make it real this time.
