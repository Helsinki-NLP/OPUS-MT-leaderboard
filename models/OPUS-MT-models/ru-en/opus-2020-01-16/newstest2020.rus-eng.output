The Kazakhs in the Russian Championship suffered four successive defeats, as well as flight from the Cup.
We turn on every game, quote "Ishtea" of Mogilevitz.
So each of us needs to think about the reasons for such failed matches.
Before we meet again, we have to prepare for them and fix the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably have fixed it by now.
But in the first place, I think we need to add to the component of the college.
In my opinion, we have a problem with that.
The Kremlin supports a ban on smoking on house balconies
The Kremlin supports any measures that will save lives, as President Dmitri Peskov's press secretary commented on the ban on smoking on balconies and apartment logs.
The cabmin has previously approved changes to the Fire Regulations, which prohibit the use of open fire on balconies and residential rooms.

"We know how many fires occur, many of them have very tragic consequences and social repercussions.
Therefore, any life saved justifies such decisions," reported Peskov.
First of all, the press secretary sees this as a fire-fighting measure, not as a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is an advocate of a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called Taipei Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Sino-American Joint Communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council for Taiwan Affairs, Ma Xiaoguan.

Taiwan, he said, was part of China and related issues related to China ' s internal affairs.
"We call on the American side to clarify the situation, to stop immediately advancing the relevant negative bills, and to cease immediately intervening in the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to Sino-American relations as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.
China must be, and will be, reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or by any forces, as Ma Xiaoguán stressed.
TikTok hides inappropriate videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
China's social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or the banned Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.
The papers that appeared in the press show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) promotes China's foreign policy objectives abroad through the app.
Most of the violations related to China's politics fall under "incitement to hatred."
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context that fits the general rules, so that social networking does not look like censorship.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of China's socialist system falls within the general prohibition of "critical or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc. ."
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the "discovery of the history of China or other countries."
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Eun, the Indian policy of Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents Donald Trump and Barak Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyung Hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as contained in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as described in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in the blocking of the user.
The second category of violations is not too strict: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
The representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach for modernization, as well as independent local expertise."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" by Rustem Bogdanov.
The Production Centre is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the bloggers' promotional materials "Producer's Center" are coordinated with social media representatives, but user materials can be posted without agreement, handing over the Bogdans.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says he has seen similar publications.
The founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory remarks, etc."
But by these rules, any content that the moderators don't like notes Zaripov.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
According to a user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Social media administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: neurosediment analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks, tells the Bogdans.
If neurose decides that the user is younger, its account can be deleted, he adds.
According to the RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the Covorking WeWork.
The residents of Istanbul spoke of the earthquake in the city.
A severe earthquake caused panic in the largest city in Turkey
On Thursday, September 26, an earthquake of 5.9 in Istanbul struck Istanbul.
Thirty-four people were injured, 10 of whom are still in hospital.
The resident of Istanbul Melique admitted that she had suffered a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
I wept right at the workplace.
It got easier later, so I got back to business.
But I'm so ashamed of myself right now!" the girl told TV channel 360.
"Istanbul had a really strong earthquake
I still can't go back!
But in general, I'm fine," I shared my impressions with political scientist Jaylan Ozgül.
The project manager, Celine, noted that the mayor of the city kept all the residents informed, but she said that the residents still felt a little bit of magnetism about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of post-earthquake communications.
The Jew said she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet was working well and she was able to send a message through WhatsApp.
As Kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all the kindergartens and schools from which all students were evacuated were closed.
473 buildings were damaged.

And the club and I discussed how to deal with the situation.
I don't think anything's wrong with our relationship.
The results of the arm amputation check were reported to the child in Roscinnadzor
A child in Rostov province was amputated because of a doctor's error, reports "Look" with reference to the website of the territorial authority of Roscinnadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, and he was given a plaster at a hospital in Zernograd district.
After some time, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
The audit found that there were irregularities in the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as in the standard and amount of assistance provided.
The verification materials have been transferred to the SCC of Russia for the region.
Previously, URA.RU reported that the head doctor of the Southurals Hospital had been arrested.
Russians have been warned of false calls from banks.
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters has increased, replacing the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to the telecommunications operators information on more than 2,500 numbers that had been called to the clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a replacement number.
An additional 218 numbers were blocked and in 59 cases a restriction on the use of financial services was imposed.
Artem Sychev, Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CBS, said that a wide range of Russian banks had been confronted with the change of number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
At Open Bank, Rosbank and Alpha Bank, reports of an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a replacement number were confirmed.
According to Biline's press service, some of the information on fraudulent calls that the Central Bank had transmitted was incorrect: the numbers that banks actually used to communicate with clients were included in the lists.
Their blocking would have led to disruption of the organization's work.
Artem Sychov said that the Central Bank was planning to create a database of fraud numbers, which would be used by the telecommunications operator at every call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

In September, Roscomnadzor identified political advertising in Google, Facebook and YouTube.
According to the agency, this took place during the Russian elections of 8 September.
The facts of the violations were referred to the State Duma Commission.
Google later stated that the company supported responsible political advertising.
In the view of the staff, it is required to comply with the laws of the country.
Facebook noted that advertisers, not the site, should be responsible for compliance with Russian electoral legislation.
Roscomnadzor's leader, Alexander Zharov, accused the company of applying double standards to political advertising.
Stoltenberg discussed with the Green Accession of Ukraine to NATO
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in an alliance at the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly.
This was discussed by a gensec during a speech at Columbia University in New York City.
Responding to a question whether the subject had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg stated that they had indeed discussed the issue and also stressed that the answer did not mention the date of Ukraine ' s accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, wrote RT.
Crimea has been offered a green alternative to NATO.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, should instead of joining NATO, engage in good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, 27 September by the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Cegrinets.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [the President of the United States] Donald Trump, who he listened to with a sour face, and establish a relationship with the President of Russia," said Cegrainitz to the journalists of "RIA News."
The Czech noted that Zelensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
He said that the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier on 27 September, NATO Gensek Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had spoken to Zelenski about the country's joining the alliance.
He said that Ukraine was obliged to meet certain conditions to that end.
On 5 June, the deputy was pleased to say that Ukraine's possible entry into the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
"Barcelona" blackmails Neimar.
The Spanish "Barcelona" and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose following the transfer of the assailant to the French "Paris Saint-Germain."
The case almost came to court, but the Catalans suggested that the player resolve the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they refuse to return to him.
Neimar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of Brazilians, have developed an interesting focus: under an agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward ended up in the SPM for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he has received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants the remaining 18.
In fact, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest on late payment.
When Neimar's claims became known in Catalonia's capital, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Granauts insist that the bonus relied on the performance of the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that only a quarter of the Euro40 million was owed to the player and requires the return of a proportionate part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neimar and Barsa almost agreed to bring back the lost player to Catalonia's dungeon.
True, the deal's broken, but there's still hope for a return forward.
So, according to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in a pre-trial manner, it would preclude the return of the Brazilian.
Naymar himself wants to come back so badly that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

The Board of the Bank of Estonia draws conclusions on trust in the Estonian State.
As long as EKRE members maintain the behavior that they say first, and then think, none of them will be invited to the bank board.

On the proposal of Laar, two members of the council, Callo and Tunisson, were to be replaced by Anne Eesmaa (Centralist Party) and Iwari Padar (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted to have Andrés Souty join the council instead of Yanus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that, in addition to Yaanus Tamkivi, Andrés Souty would be on the board.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected Laar ' s proposal to appoint new members of the Board of the Bank of Estonia.

How to Increase Future Pensions and Not Recycle
It is able to pay a pension not only from the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation but also from non-governmental pension funds.
NPF is a private company, reports Volgograd Truth.ru.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the fund invests them, and in time returns you money with interest.
If you're interested in this method, first look at the NPF information on the website of the Bank of Russia.
All foundations operate under the same rules established by federal laws.
Pension points can be bought by law.
The number of points missing depends on how many years of service you need to apply for a pension.
That's a way for those who worked informally.
In addition, a contribution can be made for a relative, such as a housewife.
A recommendation for those who think about a pension at the beginning of their career.

Which club will take Paul Mamayev on parole
Footballer Pavel Mamaev, released from parole last week, will not return to Rednodar football club.
The club's former midfielder may soon sign a contract with FK Rostov, reports the Championate portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between the representatives of Rostova and Mamaeva are now in their final stages.
A contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
"Sport Express" says that the previous day Paul Mamaev had to undergo a medical examination at the Moscow Dynamo, but the test was not carried out because of the "undefined situation in the club."
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamaev last week by agreement between the parties.
Semi-defendant has played for the Reddar club since 2014.
With the team, he won twice the bronze of the Russian Championship.
Previously, Mamaev was in favour of Moscow's Torpedo and CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for the Russian team with 15 matches.

The man with the samurai sword tried to defend the trash cart found in the garbage pile.
A resident of the U.S. city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after slamming a samurai sword on his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the trash.
A 54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, a night walker.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the scum.
Miller saw Beaver's find and got upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he was the first to dig in the trash.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and started chasing the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller took the sword out of his knives and started waving it in the direction of the cart kidnapper.
Beavers told Miller that it was recorded on video.
Having noticed the camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left a cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unknown woman entering his yard and taking the cart, shouting insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the U.S. city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and stabbed her with a sword.
He thus reacted that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated at the same hotel where he stayed, did not let him light a cigarette.
Massive riots on three.
The Moscow case against summer protestors the further, the more visible it breaks apart and loses its political content.
The evidence of the "mass disorder" itself is not verifiable, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it is certain that it will leave in the extreme annoyance of the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder) - Alexei Minyalo - was suddenly released from detention without any obligation, and a few hours later was completely rehabilitated: the SCU dropped the charges against him.
Minyalo was arrested for almost two months and was joined by several professional communities: historians, priests, literaryists.
After that, only two accused of involvement in the riots remained in the case (initially 13 accused): Sergei Fomin, who was placed under house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been extended by the court the previous day until the end of December (also charged with violence against a representative of the authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The Court sentenced the author of the joke petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States
The Court of the Widzem suburb of Riga sentenced the author of the joke petition for Latvia ' s accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
It is noted that a man has been assigned 80 hours of corrective labour and one year of probation.
"The common sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented Barteck's judgment.
He added that punishment was usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia ' s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as the petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that Bartecki has been prosecuted under the first paragraph of article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country, "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia."
Prior to this, in 2016, the author of the online petition for Latvia ' s accession to Russia received six months of prison.

The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to punish police officers who insult the Internet.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has prepared amendments to the Police Act in order to protect detainees from the dissemination of slanderous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the bill appeared on the Federal Law Portal, and the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document states that it is being developed in response to the need to protect the honour and dignity of the police officer from "dissemination on information and communications networks, including on the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including defamatory character."
The exact manner in which police officers are supposed to be protected from defamation online is not specified.
However, the explanation of the document indicated that the provisions of the amendments would be applied "by individualizing the mechanism," already preceded by the Act on the freezing of positions insulting the authorities and the Act on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the Police Act are due to enter into force in January 2020.
On 18 March, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing "hidden disrespect for the State" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roscomnadzor warns the resource of a violation and gives it 24 hours to correct it.
The first violation of the prohibitions is punishable by a fine of between 30,000 and 300,000 roubles and the second by administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Jaroslav edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Chudov District Court of Novgorod province fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for posting on the network "two recordings of indecent information that offends human dignity and public morality and manifests clear disrespect for society, the State and the organs exercising State authority in the Russian Federation."

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help to prolong youth?
The theme of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
The most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well studied and have positive effects on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer).
The famous sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular, soya), hamlet, and leaf seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a full substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm caused by such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by too many external analogues.

It wasn't the best time in terms of results and funding, but I'll never forget this club and its loyal fans, who have always been with the team!
The Munitepasov stadium, where I scored my 200th ball in my career, will always be remembered!
"Jenice" must be reborn!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best and trust that the city authorities will return their home club to them!" wrote Veretennikov to Instagram.

Hydrometal Center called the correct people's marks
Russia has a lot of folks who try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometal Center checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be truly trusted, though in the short term.
As the scientific leader of the Russian Hydromet Center, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will indeed be like our ancestors pointed out.
And if the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working mark is based on bird surveillance.
They say more about swallows if they fly low, it's usually in the rain.
It's easy to explain - when the humidity of the air is great, the mosquito wets its wings and the feathers are forced to fall to hunt insects, says TASS.
There are people's marks on different continents.
Surka Day is a traditional popular holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.

Unidentified oil spots were found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
The contamination was scattered over 2,000 kilometres of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil stains discovered began on the second September.
However, their number, as well as their territorial coverage, continued to increase every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turned out that all of them were identical, and that was the case with crude oil.
At the Petrobras State Oil Corporation, to which the samples were submitted for analysis, they stated that their composition was not consistent with oil originating from Brazilian territory.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And it's probably caught in the ocean current," told Brazilian news portal G1 by the coordinator of the Pernambuco and Paraíba Rogerio Almeida Oil Workers' Union.
He added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles covered entirely with oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute ' s specialists advise tourists and local residents to bypass the oil slicks and alert all reported contamination sites.

Russians have nothing to put to retirement - V. Matvienko
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have enough savings to make the guaranteed pension product bill fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
Another matter is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes out of which they simply have nothing to spend on increasing pension security in the future," said V. Matvienko.
The Russians, in the view of the Speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, as "permanent changes in this area have completely confused them."
That doesn't mean I'm against improving the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we have an obligation to make sure that pensions and social security of citizens are improved.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible and sensitive to domestic realities," said V. Matvienko "RIA Novosti."
The SF chapter stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) were to evolve, there must be several basic principles, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict safeguards and State responsibility to safeguard pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the dispatch to negotiate the Guaranteed Pension Product (STD) Bill.
Its main elements include a purely voluntary procedure for citizens ' participation in the savings system, the guarantee of long-term State pension savings, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by a central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Sony and Disney agreed.
The rights holder of the Getty Images Image capture News about the departure of the beloved superhero from the kinnob Marvel caused anger among many loyal fans

Disney and Sony Pictures managed to negotiate rights to use it in franchise films.
This was reported in Sony's press release, which states that the third part of the Spider-Man with Tom Holland will appear on the screen on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach consensus on income sharing, leaving the Spider-Man behind Marvel.
Sony owns the rights to a movie hero.
She rented them for Marvel films, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from films and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point Disney stopped doing that, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faiga said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey's trip [Spider-Man] is going to be going on with Marvel's cocktail.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a landmark figure.
It's a hero whose story affects generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
In doing so, Faygie recalled that Sony was also creating his own knives, built just around Spider-Man.
"He's the only superpowered hero who's ever been in a different movie universe.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spidey universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an extract from the film "Wolf on Wall Street," in which hero Leonardo di Caprio screams, "I'm not leaving!"
Information on contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half the cash from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies paid half the cost of producing the paintings.
But it wasn't Sony's idea.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Kinnosed Marvel caused anger among many loyal fans.
The details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have cooperated perfectly over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "Avengers: Final," which brought Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other superheroes Marvel together, became the most cashier in the history of the world film, replacing "Avatar."

It happened after Trump was complained to by an intelligence informant.
The informant suspected that, in a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump put pressure on his interviewer to bring a case against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Biden, and that the latter might become a rival of Trump in the elections one year from now.

The expert told me why we should give up tea in bags.
A group of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that when a bag of tea is made into a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles are released.
An expert in food safety, Elizabeth Tikhonov, said the Nation News, could also add pollen particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea, a producer can add ingredients to it that will not be indicated on the package.
The sawdust at the end of the season isn't dumped, so they might end up in tea.
"More than that, the bags don't always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of tea for the height, which was sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea was not only in the composition but also in the method of production - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"The best way to buy pure green or black tea is the least additive in the drink," the expert pointed out.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Economic Policy Committee, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to Maxim Oreshkin, Minister for Economic Development, and Anton Siluanov, Minister of Finance, inviting him to take a position on initiatives by the Federation entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional linkages
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy compiled information from the regions on their business development and self-employment programmes, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters to the region, senators were briefed on the problems of SME development and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions has been inadequate, as a result of which the business community in all regions of senators' visits has pointed out the lack of information on regional enterprise development programmes in the country as a whole," Andrej Kutepov observed.
In an annex to the letter sent to the Government, he provided a set of positive regional developments on the legalization of self-employment and a summary of regional data with proposals and issues (available for revision).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Economic Policy Committee," said the Senator's Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, support programmes for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are well under way in many regions of the country.
For example, an Entrepreneurship Support Centre operates in the Vologoda region, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In Ivanov province, a business support system has been developed to implement the single window principle through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar province, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives receive grants from the provincial budget.
There is a cluster development centre in the Orlov region.
The Amur region, within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises," provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators based on existing non-State coorking centres from the federal budget.
A number of other regions have special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people keep getting out of the shadows.
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Archangelic Region proposed replacing the term "self-employment" with "business activity," as this "most closely corresponds to the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In Ivanov province, amendments are considered necessary to expand the range of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including the maintenance and repair of living quarters, back-to-back buildings and physical training sessions.
The Bryan region considers it important to strengthen the control of unfair dairy producers through the Mercure veterinary system.
In the Kostrom and Magadan regions, they advocate the incorporation into the legal framework of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State support programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," was assured by Andrei Kutepov.
The airline helped the passengers escape the neighborhood of crying children.
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on the plane, it is now possible to find out where the little children will sit.
Now, if you want to be neighboring them, you can avoid it.
Japanese airline passengers from Japan Airlines (JAL) were able to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with young children.
The air carrier has launched a function that allows you to track where the children are going to sit.
When selecting seats in the lounge, passengers will be able to view the child ' s head in places occupied by children between eight days and two years of age during booking.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying may be as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline are thrilled with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the hosts complained that he had flown from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of adult flights only, expressing willingness to pay for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they saw nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with a breast child tried to please the travellers on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She made a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each of which had an apology note.
Oleg Tabakov's train appeared on the subway in the capital?
If you constantly use the Kaluzko-Riz line (and that's what most people in Konykov do), you're gonna be surprised.

Paul Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the "Moskov work"
Acter Pavel Ustinov joined the series of single free all pickets, which are held on Friday at the office of the President of the Russian Federation in Old Square in Moscow, and is transmitted by the correspondent for Interfax.
The picket series began on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the participants in the action, in succession, stand by and hold a poster bearing the inscription "Free All" and the names of the convicted and arrested following the unharmonized meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on a poster the names of Egor Zhukov, Cyril Zhukov, Danil Beglec, Evgenia Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podcopayev, Aydar Gubaydulin, Aleksei Minyalo, Sergei Fomina, Samariddin Rajabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyszewski, Vladislav Sini.
On 16 September, the 24-year-old Ustinov was sentenced by the Tver Court of Moscow to 3.5 years of the general regime colony on charges of violence against the OMONA Rossgvardija combatant in an unconscionable act on 3 August in the centre of Moscow (art. 318, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
Subsequently, on 20 September, at the request of the Attorney-General ' s Office, the court changed Ustinov ' s preventive measure from detention to non-exit.
For example, the petition for the release of Ustinov received more than 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
Theatre and film artists started a flash mob in support of a colleague.
In order to participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on September 18th, a line was built in the Old Square.
The case was reviewed by human rights defenders, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors, Orthodox priests.
According to Interfax, Sister Ustinov Julius, her brother did not plan to speak at a rally on 29 September in the capital in support of the "Moscow case."
The "sanctioned" deliveries to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Government of the Russian Federation, it has been estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that have fallen under the Russian food embargo has declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared with 3 million 442,200 tons for the same period in 2013, and Interfax reports.
The value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia have compensated for the lost amounts of prohibited imports.
In late August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia in the framework of counter-sentences.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended by one additional year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The destruction order was initially extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Ukraine subsequently joined the list on 13 August 2015.
Putin's decree to destroy the illegal "sanctions" (food embargo products imposed by Moscow in response to the anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food in any legal way.
As the sanctions of the West continue, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
This measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Presidential Council on Civil Society Development and Human Rights of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously described the destruction of food as "unethical" and this, he said, had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.

Chile started building a 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, construction of the dome of the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) was officially launched this week, as long as it is the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 metres.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 m.
This is a huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with diameters of 4.2 and 3.75 metres, which will help to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the dome has only just begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other professionals for three years since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of E-ELT.
The German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc received a contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about 400 million euros.
