Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law establishing administrative liability for violating the time and procedure for payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for State and municipal purposes.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of the failure of customers to comply with their obligations in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation of entrepreneurs not being able to obtain payment for government and municipal contracts that had already been executed was widespread.
At the same time, the President of the Russian Federation instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take special control of the problem.
Because the businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfair customers who entered into unfunded contracts, attempted to evade their obligations to pay and included illegal terms in contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, 9,700 submissions have been made by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to protect employers ' rights to pay on public orders, 4,500 officials have been disciplined and 533 administrative officials have been prosecuted, 75 files have been submitted to the investigating authorities for the organization of procedural checks, and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles of debt were paid to entrepreneurs.
These huge sums have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion dollar contracts.
Many, systematic delays in the payment of business services to a much more modest amount have led to basal debts.
Here's a typical case.
The manager of a small company won several million rubles of social transport services.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money in time.
The result is an increasing financial coma of debts on salaries, taxes, loans that would have led to bankruptcy had the entrepreneur not requested assistance from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The problem has now been as low as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt on State and municipal contracts identified by the procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under manual crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with the local authorities, in which all violations discovered by prosecutors are examined in detail and measures taken to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place in Yaroslavla and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ on amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences, which the President of the Russian Federation signed last week, will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers in order to establish the administrative liability of officials of the employer for violating the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in the procurement of State and municipal needs.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation on the initiative of the Office of the Procurator-General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for violation by an official of the time limit and of the procedure for payment of goods, works and services in State and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is subject to disqualification for a period of one to two years.
All procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
Civil Rights Unit issued a warning on moving to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: "The warning to travelers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and cautious when travelling across the state in connection with a number of questionable racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are brought here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group ' s recent Missouri law, which made it more difficult for people to win discriminatory claims, and the fact that State law enforcement agencies disproportionately target minorities.
"You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed," told the newspaper Kansas City Old, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints more often than ever before."
This is the first warning of this kind issued by the organization to the U.S. state.
The Group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at Missouri University and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas on a state trip, and Missouri state police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also refers to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney-General of Missouri that black drivers are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared in one way or another whether they will take the money with them for bail or inform their relatives that they are travelling through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, which makes the state the sixteenth state in terms of the number of hate crimes.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri State Act, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person for housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after the States had passed new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of racial inspections.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people were killed in a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown men fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reporting Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three were injured.
All the wounded have been taken to the hospital.
According to the Agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement personnel.
One of the intruders was arrested, the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law abolishing free baggage for non-return flights
The head of Rostourism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBC television channel that he was "apparently" to the enactment of a law abolishing the free passage of baggage on non-return flights.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has the baggage," he stressed (TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite the citizens ' fears, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of top clothes and mobile phones in handbags.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and report it, to say that it's to top clothes, to an umbrella, to a mobile phone, to an iPad, or even to some computer, " said the head of Rostourism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule of free baggage transportation on non-return flights.
This means that airlines can determine for themselves the number of places and the weight of baggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the elimination of the pollution from Baikal.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that large areas of the lake had been subject to extreme pollution in recent years.
It mandated the identification of sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned the full rehabilitation of contaminated areas.
"There is also a need to deal with the sites that continue to work here, most of them worn out, " quote RIA News of the President.
He added that the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation should carry out a verification exercise to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area due to the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental irregularities by recreational organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not all are checked in a row, but there is also a need to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
The Attorney General ' s Office had previously reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental supervision.
Let us recall that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated that there was a need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
He was informed of economic problems by the inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the limits of the Baikala water protection zone, but the Government of Buryatia was reminded that such a change was not sufficient because the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Affairs had proposed a solution to the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
There will be a new temple in the South.
In the village of Sosywa, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, Rakhtyna, together with the Berezov district, are participating in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of the Saint Nikolai Zchodzidz.
Its locations are a river bank, and the temple will be well - visible from afar, so it will serve as a travel light for fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now in place and church bells are available.
The Fleet ' s M.E.R. provided transport escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonder because it is honored by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the 18th, fisheries give settlers jobs, feed them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write in school essays about it as a local sight.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore comply with the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the butts are carefully stored in an iron box that he has taken with him from the office.
At the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - 100 meters - and throws the bulls there.
A fine for garbage in a public place - $500 local dollars - reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a kid, you can't throw a candy phantom on a bridge, you're gonna get a quick fine.
And now there's video cameras all over the place.
Indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the middle of the city are clean, like a museum.
Chang says three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine that.
He got ten hits with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and extremely harsh laws, it was dealt with locally by AIF's columnist.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, " explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has a long history of not giving a shit about the opinion of both the EU and the US on this.
If a person transports or sells a large quantity of drugs, he is given the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Premier, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
But the guy ended up hanging anyway.
After that, drug couriers in our country are moving away with effort.
The point is that Singapore is bound by the laws of the whole world, not just the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are - a millionaire, a vice primer, a famous artist or a member of the European Union.
One option in this case is if you find a half a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk through Singapore and you meet a lot of warning signs everywhere, you give a simple diva - how many bans there are in this city state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be bought strictly by prescription (!) of a doctor.
A tourist's gum isn't taken from him when he arrives, but if he sticks a rubber on the subway, he's gonna get a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on their necks, "I was trashing."
In addition to the fine, the burrows of butterflies are often sentenced to "dress in the janitor's room": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6,000 rubles pay a "offender" who forgot to wash away water in the public toilet, and when trying to fill a small need in an elevator in a residential building, a special detector works - locks the doors and sends a signal to the police.
Among the exotic laws are the prohibition on feeding pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs, and even the excessive pouring of the room plant (!): the abundance of water is thought to attract mosquitoes.
Smokers are not allowed to carry lighters on the subway in order to avoid fire, otherwise they will be fined S$5,000.
Anyway, there's a thought: no matter how hard you try, you're gonna break something.
It's not like that, it's trying to tell me Muhammad Kabir-Kajarya, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws only exist on paper, and I haven't seen anyone get caught for breaking them in 20 years.
Why do you keep them?
So citizens don't relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
Let's say if a minor sells cigarettes in a kiosk, everything will be punished along the chain: the shopkeeper will pay a huge sum, the violator himself will get kicked in the back with sticks, and the seller will also be whipped and imprisoned.
It is precisely because of such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
As early as the 1970s, we had a mess on the roads, with motorists ignoring traffic lights, driving as they wanted, driving drunk.
After the imposition of the fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having had a scotch round, knows that if he stops, the policeman won't let go for the bribe, fine the cost of the apartment, and send him to jail for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a form of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty," a guest from the United States horrifying the general wealth of the inhabitants, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature."
Descating things like this isn't natural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're afraid to throw your paper on the sidewalk, you catch up when you're on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to Little India, and all of a sudden, there's a "shape break": there's plastic cups at the bus stop.
"What do you mean?" you're surprised.
That's how the Singapores laugh.
Anything happens.
Not every crime of this kind will be seized on the spot, but you must know that if you are identified, you will not be retaliated, because you have broken the law.
More often than not, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, I was moving very carefully - motorcyclists often pick up smartphones and cameras from tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty homeless people and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw garbage in the trash, either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, clean and secure city on Earth through the recruitment of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
That's human nature: remember, no one in Russia was wearing a seat belt until they were fined.
Although Singapore is not about fines, it is about voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that in Russia, people would be happy to have clean streets, no trash on the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment, thank you, no.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this as well as everyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump's key ideologies, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brought a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a violent dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals for a drastic reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue himself.
Receipts of the owners of pleasure ships and artists of the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to harm her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus' poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller yelled at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was right about the facts, but as he said himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing freely, / the wretched waste of your abundant shores."
Never before has "unhappy scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't doing literature -- he made it clear that in America, Trump wasn't waiting for these people.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the statue's cap after her death - were very well aware that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the connection between the French and American republics by means of a banal classical figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, a woman's figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Expelled.
The combination of poems and images was a brilliant feminist movement and a crushing attack against American navimism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, but the right one changed it back.
Thunder Rush Limbo, a sort of John the Baptist who celebrated Trump's coming, in 2010 reasoned that Freedom does not invite anyone, but rather it is an early neoconservator who carries the flame of America to the world lying in darkness: " Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the US."
Against Limbo's custom, it really hit a spot here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of vision.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Blake highly values the Scottish members of the UK team.
Eileen Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scottishs in the UK team.
Neil Blake, the director of the British Federation of Light Athletics, announced that a 16-person Scottish team at the World Championship would make "a significant contribution to the team's game."
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the February 2017 London Championship.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special" and the British Federation of Light Athletics should take that into account.
"We know that and we're trying to figure it out and we're gonna support it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they've done needs to work.
The British Athletics Federation: what they did has to be done.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why this is the case, but it's quite brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Mure and Andrew Buchert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 metres; and Aileed Doyle chose the team as her captain.
"Eiled's being modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"A lot of athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or practice, have left this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Aylde put into it were wonderful."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth World Championship will run 400 metres with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British team are "unbelievable."
The previous record of Scottishs at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
There's Laura Muir, who specializes in the middle-range race, who beat five British and two European records last year.
She's gonna run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who's gonna be in the 1,500-metre race, is another Scotsman who's worth looking at: behind his back, he's had a successful season where he won the British team selection contests and the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship when Lee McConnell was the only Scottish on the team.
The team captain says she's "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases will claim medals and compete for the finals.
"The captain of the team is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was in any case a great honor, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, "it's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
It shows how much we've accomplished.
And they're all a lot of lattes that'll be trying to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of the fact that we're gonna be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere is going to be great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: You don't have to run for public office if you're not ready to listen to criticism from voters.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't shut his critics up.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech of us deaf and dumb as sheep to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should have tried to be more Washington-like.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who gave their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "what"?
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And it's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a state-prevalent democratic state.
He's second in the approval rating among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a high-end reactionary.
He has demonstrated a strong hand in state management and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as an easy way to communicate with his voters and to joke about his bald head after chemotherapy.
It is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful to block the people who come to the Governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and administered by the administration for taxpayers' money.
In an interview with the Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was merely their modernization.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spamers, and haters on the Internet.
The Post talked to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the commentary on the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some say right away that it's a so-called crank, instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What subordinate governors call a concentrated spam attack, others would probably call an "active life stance."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is a much less dusty job than before when it required sending people, collecting and burning critical newspapers, or arresting and shutting up protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who were banned on his Twitter account.
One of the first, landmark decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge of Alexandria, James K. Kasheris, the chairman of the County Review Board of Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor, Matt Bavin, filed a complaint against the American Civil Liberties Union for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It mustn't be that hard.
In the time of Washington, D.C., the era of affordable postal expenditures was about the same as today's Internet coup.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letters severely undermined its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases "Yuricola," "Valerius," "Belizarius" and "Porcious" wrote letters to newspapers that ridiculed Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he wasn't trying to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very heart of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home at Renaissance.
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferty, is looking forward to living comforts for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led a neighboring club at Archerfield Links, moved towards the final round last year, until he lost Paul Ilsa, was assigned to a new seat, and acted as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club, Jerry Sarwadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club build up, and we've seen it come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field in its best moment, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's a strong supporter of this game, and he's proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field."
The Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to win the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," said the player from Southport.
"I couldn't try again to win "Extremadura Open" because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magic to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it."
He is returning to battle on Gary Orr's home land, who joined the European senior sports tournament after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 "Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open" tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to do well, but you feel the extra burden."
I had great pleasure playing again, and I showed a pretty good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are so far."
In the field, the trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnem and senior major champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmewer and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free of charge, and parking costs five pounds an hour if one person is in the car, and ten pounds if two or more people are in the car.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Distinct tunnels above highways that can absorb car carbon monoxide are already being tested on British roads.
According to Autocar, the country ' s transport agency reported positive results of tests on a 100-metre tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The 6-metre high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British intend to expand the network of electric charging stations, implement a number of road traffic reduction measures, increase the use of commercial electric powered transport and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all atmospheric pollution is due to transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorud changed his sentence to a fine.
Mosgorud changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamaeva, who was sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
This is reported by TASS.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had previously asked the court to change the sentence to a conditional one, explaining its request that Mamaeva's illness "obstructs him from finding him in prison conditions."
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment in a general regime colony for robbery suffered by a former Special Forces combatant.
On 19 July, the court released a man from detention at a retreat in SIZO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian "Golden Land"
Bardin Deguey doesn't use the stove when preparing lunch.
She doesn't even use a pottery much.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County, in the rebel Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply puts sweet potatoes, which is called "nota," right in the middle of the house.
Half an hour later, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor - she doesn't have any furniture - and that's where she does her housework, like washing clothes with murky water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk in the village after five nights," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public in front of the occupying forces.
The ongoing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta Government, which retains strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as an abandoned city; the road includes an hour-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative centre, to Nabira, and then a five-hour quake on a hired car.
There's no public transport.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses with bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust into a variety of redish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have come here, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, my pagos were worshiping a god named Uga Tamey.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Deguey says, showing off his bright, hand-cracked turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
"We've only worn leaves on our body before."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast forests valued at $78 billion.
This wealth, however, brings with it one misfortune for the popes, guaranteeing that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the New York Times investigation in 2005, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Human rights defenders claimed that more than 500,000 papuas had been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more had been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - particularly, as alleged in another report, rape and electric shocks - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of casualties because accidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Guyanas have been protracted as Papua's resources have attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province ' s 3.5 million population is 83 per cent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive.
Javan shops, barungi, sell fried chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than Papuan natives," explains Abette Yo, a twenty-four-year-old Paniai who moved to Jayapuru, the provincial capital, because of work.
"As a result, Papuan natives - Mama Mother (Women) of Papua - lost their market."
Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, known as Jokovi, vowed to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter received support from 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, waiting for him to meet our hopes for justice," said Yo.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokovi Paniai, he experienced a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas anthems at the Enarotali campfire when two Indonesian soldiers broke out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The scared kids told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers some time later.
According to the victims and witnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beaten them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election commission building, and the next day, the situation got worse.
About a thousand papuas men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed white, the dance of the Papuas tribe of mee pago, running around in circles and playing bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers were given an order by internal radio, saying, "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," as he claimed in an official document that was seen by TIME correspondents, but which was not published in the local media.
50 - year - old Heremias Kayame, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse from house to house.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told "TIME" magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who shot him, but says the bullet came from the front of the soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were lots of shots," he adds.
A local resident, Alfius Jowa, was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, says.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," darkly told the magazine "TIME" Johannes, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, Chief Police Inspector of Papua, told reporters that his officers were just "defending" their base because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," stated Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the murders only got to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi gave a passionate speech in Jayapur, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But the excuses came almost immediately.
"The majority of violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the nineties or at the beginning of the zeros.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed," he said.
Viranto then declined to speak with the magazine "TIME" on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through the courts."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" for the loss of more than 1,000 lives during the 1999 bloody East Timorese independence vote, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai have met similar statements with dark mistrust.
"I've been questioned four times over the last three years, but there has been no change at all," says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the district of Deiay next to Paniai.
A clash between villagers and a construction manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital resulted in the death of one person and the injury of 17 others, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Dawe, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company ' s construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers who responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we're afraid of retaliation," reported 20-year-old Dominggu Badya, who lives near the hospital and sees the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is causing dissatisfaction among the tribes of mee, moni, Dani and Damal, scattered throughout the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuas through sporadic attacks and kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of "protection of national independence."
Some of them never came back.
Among the Papuan population, Paniai is considered to be a "heat, forgotten place."
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally unaffordable.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly a note, as well as some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers are worth only Rs. 10,000 (75 cents).
Economic disparities between indigenous papuas and new migrants have increased over time and have arrived in large numbers since the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport.
Few existing jobs are usually available to better educated and wealthy migrants.
Dads rarely have the money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudie and Basile Longshan were deported from Papua for "inconsistencies with relevant organizations" despite being given rare permits to film.
According to Felim Keene, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jocovi's campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua ' s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including shooting at Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanatha Nasir, waved the group's statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still democratic and has a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands headed by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local residents broke their silence, praying, "We want freedom," as the source who was also present but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the popes say that they are unlikely to vote again for Jokovi.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he's surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of threats from the greedy army, are trapped in poverty, and their education and health care are miserable.
Gobai says the people of Paniai, like the other papuas, consider their vote for Jokowi to be a duty that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience: the body of one of the victims was buried on a plot of land in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, at least they won't let the guilty forget their crimes.
"Killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, without raising his head.
"What else were we gonna do?"
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai Fakel skyscraper
The fire hit one of the world ' s highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to leave a 70-dive-dwelling structure at a distance of 337 metres.
It's the second fire to hit a high-rise building called "Faquel" in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported and no operational news was available on the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor, " reported Reuters, a skyscraper called George.
According to Dubai Civil Defence, fire brigades put out a fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter for victims.
An incident could bring back to the agenda the security of materials used in exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
In the course of an investigation by the Faquela administration following the fire in 2015, it was found that the placing - the outer panels used for design and isolation - was the most affected.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the isolation system and the plaque of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire that had occurred there in June, killing about 80 people.
The increase in tourism in Ida Virumaa in June proved minimal
According to data obtained from the Department of Statistics at Rus.err.ee, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from Northeast hotel services, an increase of 125 persons or 0.6 per cent over the same period of the year.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
For example, foreign travel increased by 7.3 per cent (544) to 7,994 in June.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent, from 12,944 to 12,525.
Russian tourists increased most notably in the region, by 8.9 per cent or 318 compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to his fans who were responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans at Instagram who were responsible for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he hasn't commented on the rumors, but today he posted a piece of the August 1 article of "Vedonomy."
Photo by Malakhov signed the "boss milk suction" tag.
Article on how to prevent a worker from being burned and to pay attention to his condition.
When we recall the numerous reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who has undertaken to reformulate "Let them speak," it becomes clear what he has so transparently hinted at, he writes "KP."
It was reported that the television host Andrei Malakhov was currently on vacation and had not signed the application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with regard to dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Helmand Province of Afghanistan, transferring to RIA Novosti.
According to the police, a mined vehicle exploded the previous night near the military checkpoint in Girishk County.
We know 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange office.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver took a video of a shark that bit his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured a video shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The band posted on Facebook a unit of the American Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Scomal is a member.
The incident took place on 2 August off the coast of Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
A man tried to remove a shark from a camera on a special stick during the underwater voyage.
When he saw a man, an animal more than three metres long swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera without attempting to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did this to determine whether or not the gadget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this behavior of the marine animal was new to scientists.
The reason for the mass fight at the Ural Military Centre became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District came to the Jelan Training Centre, where a mass attack took place to investigate the incident.
Some details of the massacre have already come to light.
According to Mash's pub, which appeared on the Vkontakte page, the Ural military unit's 31612 contractors had a violent fight over an unattended bed.
It all started out that a private named Sayan was defiantly ignoring an officer's order to fill out a sticking sheet.
The officer was sided by soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men were ripped off at the barracks of the bed and sink, knocked out the glass.
More than 10 people were injured in a mass fight.
The CSB denied the stabbing.
The study revealed that at least one fifth of the U.S. passengers are carrying prohibited items into the plane.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items in the aircraft's luggage through the US Transportation Security Administration's search points, including at least 6 per cent getting on the aircraft, in an oversight of prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and involving over 1,000 people, also revealed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something banned by the ATA, 19.7 per cent were millenials compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
In fact, it is most common to pass food and water on to ATS employees.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had deliberately carried sharp objects through screening, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had knowingly carried prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport searches and how many had deliberately done so.
It is expected that most of the most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggles smuggling through searches by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATA rules are quite complex and complicated.
People often don't know exactly what kind of fluid they can carry or how many.
So it's not surprising that most of what the ATA takes are forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought the ATA might be banned from carrying a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt refuses to delay the implementation of Obama's emission reduction regulations
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency revoked his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama's regulations aimed at reducing emissions of air-polluting and smog-generating substances.
Pruitt explained his decision by listening more than in previous administrations to the needs of individual state environmental regulators.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute began around the 1 October deadline by which the states were to ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "consistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who was the Attorney General of Oklahoma before he was appointed President Trump to his current position, was long known as a consistent antithesis to the strengthening of environmental standards.
Following his move to Washington, D.C., Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of regulations opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the Pewett course of return.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by dramatically changing the course on ozone standards, he had simply fulfilled the EPA's obligation to cooperate with states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous EPA administrations, often failed to meet the deadlines, then waited for claims from activist groups and others, and discussed time limits during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who had filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use his "power to delay and other powers conferred by law" to make sure that the rules of jcyjdfys are clear and all available information."
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this matter.
New York's Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed an action against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
"The change in EPA course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the ability to cover their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C. joined the suit.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The result can cause serious respiratory problems in those who are sensitive, resulting in thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed the unexpected change in Pruitt's course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who's charged with protecting the air we breathe," Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity said.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who contaminate the air and their special interests."
Congress of IAAF extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted in favour of extending the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (WFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be maintained.
In favour of the extension, 166 votes were cast, 21 votes were cast, and TASS transfers.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that the WFLA had made significant progress towards achieving the conditions set by the re-entering board, but that those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA at the London World Cup, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team consisted of 19 IAAF candidates.
WFLA was subject to indefinite disqualification by IAAF in 2015.
A report by the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dick Pound, was published at that time, highlighting numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the most recent IAAF Council report, read the IAAF extension of the sanctions against the IAAF.
Annoying defeat.
In the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbeth First Party of Russia, Newoskov's Chimik conducted a field match against the FK Kaluga.
A little over 10 days ago, rivals played in Russia's cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
The chemical did not give in to the opponent, but the second-hand relaxing at the end of the match led to a grudge and a fiasco.
After a recent calusan defeat with a score of 0:3, many prearranged an easy victory for the masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the New Oskovans have forced themselves to be considered and acted from a defensive position, but from a position of force.
In the 1st time, the Caljucans were built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very high-quality match was performed by Alexei Sirotin, who, on several occasions, repelled dangerous blows and gave confidence to the partners.
Unfortunately, the Chimika attack lacked effort and luck to put Kaluga's defense at a dead end and score the first goal on its way out.
After a break, the game began to play in the course.
The New Moskovans were more active in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team were defense errors, which allowed the calendars to create a number of moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemical intercepted the territorial advantage and launched several dangerous attacks.
But the Kalusan experience played its part - they conducted the ending in a more intelligent and cold-blooded manner, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chimik transferred the ball to the corner, which the masters of the fields, without resistance, moved to the gate.
The goal was written by Yuri Dubrovin.
At the reporting meeting, Chemical demonstrated a good game, but suffered a grudge.
In front of our team, another departure is expected - on 11 August, at 7 p.m. in Moscow, at the Edward Streltsov stadium, the Novoskovtsovs will fight the favourite of the FK Centre "Ararat," which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support "chemist!"
The venue and time for the meeting of the New Oskovans is 6.30 p.m. outside Magnolia (East, d. 2, Corp.
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Slavov, Beljanin (Adojevtsev), Andrejchenko (Lygin)
Chimik Club Press Service
According to the phone transcript published, Trump was pressuring Mexico about paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post published a transcript of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieta Trump insisted that he should stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States ripped him off for publicly speaking against the wall and, according to the leaked information, told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, published, also revealed a hot fight.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement requiring the US to accept refugees going to Australia was "funny," "disgusting" and "dumb," and insisted that due to an agreement made by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop resettling refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day."
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia were flown from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to the Russian airline, carrying the bodies of Russian women who died in Abkhazia, left Sochi for St. Petersburg at 8:15 p.m. on Moscow time.
At the final point of the journey, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Hall, will meet on board, and the Deputy Minister for Hospitals and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba, told the journalists.
Previously, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic stated that all the costs involved in bringing the bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to compensate the families of the victims in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the bombing to travel and reside in the Republic, but the relatives sent only a power of attorney to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at around 4.20 p.m. Moscow time, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorsk Gudaut district in a missile-artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, after which the large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to be detonated.
As a result, the warehouse was set on fire, which triggered uncontrolled explosions of various modifications of projectiles.
Two Russian citizens, Elena Poliakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeev, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a sulphide source, died as a result of an emergency.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of gravity, were taken to medical facilities in the Republic.
At present, there are seven persons in hospital and the rest have been discharged.
A grand jury will study Russia's influence on American elections.
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Mueller, convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia's influence on the U.S. presidential election in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to examine witnesses under oath.
The files collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to be charged.
The grand jury's convening gives Mueller additional authority to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the jury's investigation, which began a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnica, then candidate for president Donald Trump.
In June 2016, Mueller himself had previously promised to verify the details of the meeting.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. previously reported that from his meeting with Weselnitzka, he had been waiting for a compromise at the headquarters of the candidate for the Dempartia Hillary Clinton, but no disclosure documents had been submitted, and it had been a question of adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement that he had met with Veselnica was literally dictated by Trump Senior.
At the White House, it was made clear that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained at work.
Penza's Deputy Chief of Administration, Irina Shirshin, was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, reporting to RIA Newsti.
No official reports have yet been received from the law enforcement authorities in this regard, but the UK ' s press service has assured them that they will soon follow.
Penza City hasn't commented on what happened yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the administration of the Penza.
She has been in charge of urban development and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had long served as the head of the Department of Public Engineering in the Penzen region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again as a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no cosmodrome or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are being demolished in some countries, the Gagarin monuments, on the other hand, are "walking around the planet."
In 2012, a monument was installed in United States Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument at the Royal Observatory was erected to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The memorial in Karlov Warah, Czech Republic, escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the centre of the city to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, the Yurius Gagarins monument appeared in Riga.
That's the name of the first cosmonaut in Latvia, and he looks like he was 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: activists are gonna lose Lynch's courts on stage to bring them to justice.
In 1948, Ford Mercury passed the audience in Monroe, Georgia, and stormed into a small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The chief, a middle-aged man wearing a thin stripe in a suit, took a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The insiders were shaking with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man said.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene that started on July 22, is just a scene.
But when Roger's neck was hit with a noose, almost everyone in the audience really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night that in 1946, two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynching the dolls.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the play.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of Georgia's Congress who's been fighting for human rights all his life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until justice is achieved."
The coroner covers one of Morse Ford's lynching victims with a sheet on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of involvement in lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two related vigilante motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruled for the first time that black citizens had been allowed to vote for the primer, which was due to take place that summer.
During the same election, according to the FBI, a black user, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester in a fight, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says the rumors are that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to have wasn't from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," one of the reports of the FBI concludes.
"It is also clear that there was an agreement between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on voting rights," he says.
"They've all been killed to send a signal to black people in town, "if you register and vote, you'll have the same thing."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene runs an annual play that reproduces the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, it captures the audience and tells of the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch and it's harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year's play began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest black - gathered in the room and listened to a year-long review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Greene.
He has played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role has never been easier.
"I think I'm dirty because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
The actors Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Raskona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are repeating their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Ruskon screams back.
There's a blow.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all black actors) is laughing.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What is it," Ascon asks.
He's concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," says Greene through the laugh.
"I just don't think the whites said nigga back then."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black artists.
"You're gonna call it a hard 'r'."
And the energy in the room is also changing: discomfort is replaced by a sense of partnership.
Everybody has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Raskona says the "n" word, it's clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The play ends cruelly and quickly.
Screaming, shooting, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands above the bodies of actors and sings the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billy Holiday.
Her voice breaks through the word.
In a hundred yards, half a hundred viewers wipe their tears and sweats out of their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live close by.
They all endured Georgia's heavy breath for almost eight hours while Brooks was taking them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until then, the murders were only a story, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems like their ghosts are hanging in the air.
When the last note of the song fades, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Kids bend to their heads, touch the blood paint, and still bodies, whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mumbles, like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors drop ropes off their necks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Raskona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the show finally fell on him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is discussing a play with the black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski can hardly find words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, creepy words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who, after eating, remembers his work as a human rights defender, has a lot of attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's presentation.
"The play inspires us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have endured but also teaches us," he says.
'Cause if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Naval for violations on "agitation Saturday"
The Simon Court of Moscow fined Aleksei Navalov 300,000 roubles for violating the order of the meeting.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, entitled "Repudiation of the organization of the meeting."
Previously, Judge Jizir Mussakaev of the Simon Court of Moscow had completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of opposition opposition Alexei Navalov, who had been prosecuted under the same article as Natal.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday" which the supporters of Navalov conducted in Moscow on 8 and 9 July.
After seeing the campaign material that followed the Sabbath participants, the police considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately hidden its true essence, a public action (which required prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomasouev, requested the termination of the administrative proceedings in the absence of an offence and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in drawing up the report.
Volkov was not detained on the saturday itself, but received a summons requiring him to report to the police station for an event with his active participation.
Naval and another opposition member, Nikolai Laskin, received similar summonses.
A bride and three wedding guests were arrested in Mordovia
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported to the Republican Bureau of the Investigation Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several shots at the guests of the event who had come to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code (Huliganism), article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), (e), (and) of the Criminal Code (attempt to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner, out of hooligan motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man had opened fire because the wedding guests had chosen to bathe and had gone to the waterhouse in the area.
Minergo will increase requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Russian Ministry of Energy will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, gas turbines, gas turbines, oil refinery and oil extraction facilities are launched, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft Government Regulation has already been prepared and submitted for public consultation.
The new requirements will only apply to the "critically important energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats identified in the document include obtaining information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, bad faith partners and hackers.
The EU has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
On 4 August, the European Union Press Service announced that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to a scandal over the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by Arguments of the Week.
The EU Council Press Service stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded because of the Siemens turbine scandal, which had allegedly been brought to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and that the decision had been taken, the sanctions against Russia had been expanded.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life.
On Friday, the British Education Group of Pearson announced that it would cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce the amount of pre-recipient dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the start of another restructuring programme aimed at dealing with the problems facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which, according to the head of John Fallon's company, will mainly occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it was planning to cut spending by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May during the third cost-cutting programme to try to bring back the business that had been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
Last month, the company that agreed to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its projections for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, as described in a NATO report.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of an incident in the Karabakh urban area.
The explosion was the last of the massacres in Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people died as a result of an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reported that the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a "man-portable improvised explosive device."
All the wounded are reported to be stable and treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondence reports that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
The United Nations reported that at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20 per cent occurred in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing of a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had launched the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people - the most serious human casualties in the country since United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence is stressing the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its lines of conduct and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, quashs the decision to postpone the passage of the Air Pollution Act
The United States Environmental Protection Agency reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama law requiring states to limit air pollution emissions one day after 15 states sued the agency because of this move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone 2015 measurements," stressing that this step demonstrates the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and responsiveness to them," said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, filed a lawsuit with the Federal District of Columbia alleging that the intention was unlawful.
President Donald Trump's administration is attempting to reverse the wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have been resisted by Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency website says that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing "can worsen lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new course of action that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies ask the police to restrict movement on the Pskov coast.
The Pskov people ' s elect sent an address to the UMVD chief of the city of Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the Great River.
Members of the proudness of Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory of Vorgenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the area safer and more secure.
The problem is that violators ignore the pedestrian track signs and freely ride the coast.
As a result, major repairs and improvements have been carried out for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds become uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, during the evenings, central coastal patrols are conducted by PPP motor platoon officers and friends.
As a result, the number of vehicles passing through is decreasing, but traffic is not stopped altogether.
Putin demanded that the investigating authorities not remove the hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that investigative agencies should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the Head of State at the meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, "it is necessary to eliminate the use for investigation of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers."
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is sufficient to make copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The Head of State added that "it is not possible to create conditions that prevent the enterprise from continuing to operate until the tax cannot be paid."
Olga Bouzova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
Olga Bouzova's TV host admitted that she wanted to call the ex-husband, Dmitri Tarasov.
At present, the celebrity is in the U.S., where he works.
Just before Olga visited Las Vegas, she decided to publish a post on Instagram's social network.
She reported that she had not married, had not made new tattoos, nor had she called her ex-wife with the words that he had ruined her life, although she was eager to do so.
Buzova said she'd remember this trip forever because she had great fun.
The British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Cornelius Faj's magic minister in a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in his 92nd year of life.
This was reported on Thursday by the newspaper Independent.
His family told us about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived "a great life, having succeeded in film, theatre and television in 70 years of his career."
==Early life==Hardy was born in 1925 in Cheltnam, England.
In 1959, he played with Lawrence Olivier on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in the Tragedia of Coriola.
Hardy was also remembered for his repeated role as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's screens about Miss Marple.
For his role in the BBC TV drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Cinema and Television (BAFTA) Award.
Robert Hardy has also served as US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on many occasions.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried along with his crowned wife, Queen Margret.
This year, the couple have a golden wedding, but the couple's agenda is not about preparations for the celebrations, it's about a moot argument.
His Highness gave up the title of the Consort Prince, and he stated to the Queen that the Consort King had never been granted her title.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the official wife of the Queen.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on Washington to stop shoving Moscow.
At the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans, reacted.
The statement was circulated by the foreign policy department some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the United States was increasingly using the cold war strains, which were inadequate in current realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop shoveling the Russian Federation.
As the "Arguments of the Week" wrote the previous day, US Vice-President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive fight.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be moving steadily towards holding the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated champion in the World Boxing Council's lightweight, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's champion in the second half weight.
After the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former World Champion in the four-weight category by Erian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers enter the top five boxers, regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko protects his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Climas, noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be the right thing to do.
"I used to be half weight," Garcia reminded me.
"I've climbed to the category for the Bronner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm a little short for 140.
I want to go down to half easy.
And he's gonna have to go up to half-light, and then we're gonna have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's get them to do it."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked if the fight should be broadcast via PPV as part of the strategy he was pursuing to get Lomachenko to perform his debut fight at 135 later this year in order to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of lightweight World Championship at the Forum on September 23rd.
"The fight may be on the PPV because all the fans have asked for it," said Garcia, expressing later his willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial terms.
"We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko's "awesome boxer" and maybe he's gonna go to his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately give Garcia some praise and said he thought that the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the impact and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising in front of their own fight.
"This fight must take place.
No other fight has caused so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's gonna be a great fight."
On several central streets of Moscow, traffic will be blocked for the weekend.
This weekend, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted to the capital on the section of Tver Street from Nastassian alley to the Triumph Square, as well as to the 1st Tver-Yam Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on the Leningrad Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yam Street.
The closure will operate on both strips at all sites, as reported by the Moscow Transport Department Information Centre.
The streets will be closed from midnight on 5 August until 5 a.m. on 7 August because of their improvement.
On the weekend, traffic will also be closed down on the Moscow Coastal section.
The construction of the "Given" Park continues there.
Putin asked the Attorney General to check Baikal.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to verify the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"Please ask the Attorney General's Office to verify the Baykal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities," stated Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested action if violations were detected.
New results of tests published to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden
Recent tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for not being able to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensics Agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the testees were rated as 18 years of age or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensics Agency assessed that the test "probably 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably less than 18."
Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensics Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past months.
"We don't see a big difference with last month's statistics, the numbers are quite the same," he said to the portal The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which persons were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases "most likely the age of the test is 18 years or older."
However, after considering the 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of X-raying wisdom teeth and tomography of knee joints and giving them to dentists and X-rays, has also provoked criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist at the Caroline Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they have passed through sexual maturity before or after normal maturity.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we need to use the measurement methods that we use now.
Biological age is thus very uncertain.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend to be able to do it," he said to Metro.
However, Geranssen of the Forensics Agency argued in favour of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child as an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when the person is 18 soon, in which case he is about 10 percent."
I'll see if I can run for president.
During his working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin stated that he was willing to consider whether he would run for president of Russia in the 2018 elections and would pass on to Interfax.
This statement was in response to a request from the residents of Cheremushka village in Buryat region.
In a video conference on the eradication of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interviewer wrote to Putin: "Vladimir Vladimirović, we ask you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run for office again."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, Russian President Dmitri Peskov ' s press secretary commented on some media reports that Vladimir Putin ' s election headquarters would be headed by Russian President Anton Vaino ' s chief of staff.
Peskov called these assumptions "nothing based on hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there are no headquarters, it's far away, far away from the election campaign," said Peskov.
"As long as it's not on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justis, announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving into another party.
"Do you like it or not, the Democrats are getting away from me," Governor Justis said.
"Today I say to you many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, "I can no longer be of use to you as a democratic governor."
The rally blew up with applause.
"So tomorrow I'll change my registration to a Republican," Justis added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's a different time to play."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42 per cent cap, and Justice did not support the Democratic party candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that "The transfer of Governor Justis to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of an obstacle than working to make our country great again."
"Bearing in mind only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages," reported the representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDaniel, in a CBS News statement.
The cat heavyweight by the name of Mr. Pretty Boy found the house thanks to social media.
A petist from Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., built a cat named Mr. Beauty, weighing over 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photograph of the cat was posted on Facebook in the nursery account asking him to find the owner because "he was clearly fed by someone earlier."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's face could become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Beau.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazie, who promised to take overweight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman told me that she had already had such an experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five pounds.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with the animal's photograph gathered more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she might well have made a career in the model business.
Coe praised Russia's "sincere" apology for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, an international athleteist, praised what he described as genuine Russian apologies for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the right time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Athletics, Dmitri Schlahtin, told the International Association of Athletics Federation Congress, which had taken place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country ' s exclusion from sporting competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who had stolen gold and silver medals at the competition.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted in favour of maintaining the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of publicly funded doping.
"I thought today's response, today's report was very sincere," told the reporters by the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Coe.
"All the council and the entire congress loved... that the Russian Federation itself admitted that it was going through a very hot time and is now doing everything it can to take care of the Federation's restructuring."
Coe said that he also "liked" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we're moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," Coe said.
"In the next few months, we must do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will participate under a neutral flag in the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report at the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing was still not done in sufficient quantity, and suspended coaches were still doing their job.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason.
The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) detained journalist Vasily Muravitsky was arrested for two months and handed over to the SBU.
An Internet employee of the Journal of Zhitomira is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and attacking Ukraine's territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering this to be a "warvar policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
Commandante Borsini, a patrol ship, entered Libyan territorial waters in order to stop the influx of illegal migrants, together with the Libyan Navy.
The Italian Parliament decided to start the operation on Wednesday.
Rome has agreed with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which, however, does not control much of the country.
The opposition Cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating Libya ' s sovereignty.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his subordinate orders to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe those threats and intended to send another military vessel into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in negotiations between Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration following the publication in July of statistics on the number of illegal arrivals from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for receiving migrants had been exhausted.
Large-scale malfunction occurred in Skype
A global failure in Skype was recorded in several countries around the world today.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began sending mass complaints to the program's developers.
Microsoft stressed that professionals are already actively working to address the problems faced by the people of Europe and North America, clarifying RIA News.
Let's recall that Skype's work also failed in June this year.
Users were unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of Ukraine's light athlete team were suspended from participating in the FM.
Olga Earthak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short-range running, are excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the country ' s Federation of Light Athletics (FLAU) website.
This decision was taken by the organization in connection with the initiation by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
Coach Earthak Sergei Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects an athlete to use doping.
Poch is the bronze winner of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, Europe's 2010 Championship in the race 4-100 metres, and Earther is the winner of the 2012 European championship in the race 4-400 metres.
The London World Athletics Championships will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How football's financial rules will affect Neimar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. Germain.
Whatever the consequences may be, the Paris St. Germain, the governing body controlling European football, whose power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions tournament, has a role to play.
From the rules of the financial "Fairplay" introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that SPG will eventually have to show that Neimar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilians from the contract, and Neimar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The SPG can definitely break free to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michelle Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their quest for success were essentially cheating and risking destruction if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on club debts and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then to spend heavily to improve the team and create a world brand - became a difficult plan.
During this three-year assessment period, which is taking place in 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And even though Platini was deposed in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
"The FFP will be alive, and we will move forward to tighten the rules," told Associated Press last week, Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP in UEFA.
Although SPG will pay for the buy-back of Naimar's contract at a one-time rate, it can, for reporting purposes, distribute this amount throughout the duration of its contract.
Neimar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as an expense of Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions by FFP in 2014, SPG, as well as the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were subjected to severe sanctions.
SPM imposed a fine of Euro60 million (82 million dollars), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and was required to limit its team to the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating its income from companies associated with club owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored SPG, if the amount of funding was considered to be above standard market prices, UEFA would not have allowed it to be considered a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that SPM's funding by the Qatar Tourism Authority had been increased.
It was reported that part of Neimar's earnings at SPG could have come from payments made by the organization committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But SPG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neimar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a manoeuvre could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on SPG mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, persons familiar with the situation reported that UEFA had not engaged in preliminary discussions with SPM on the Neirar transfer.
They spoke to Associated Press on the basis of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of SPM.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, SPM received more than Euro10 million in returns at a turnover of Euro542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
SPG expects the arrival of Neimar to be a good ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attribute and team-type T-shirts.
In the club, it is expected that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent as a result of the hiring of a new player.
No doubt angry that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish league tried to stop Neimar's transfer, claiming that SPG would violate the financial "Fairplay."
"This is the obvious case of "financial doping," with the club and the state," said Spanish newspaper "AS," President Javier Tebas of La Ligue, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of "SPM" is Qatar.
Arsenala Coach Arsenal, Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La League's doubts about State funding.
"It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it completely changed the football landscape in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's becoming very difficult to keep a financial fair play, because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and place of the swearing-in.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law have been drafted by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to determine directly the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as disabled persons, will be released from the solemn oath, as follows from the finalized text of the amendments to the Russian Citizenship (Izvesy) Bill, which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of swearing in Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents on 6 June, during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
This idea was introduced by the deputies as an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the annulment of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 205.2, para. 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of aircraft, trains or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (art. 211, para. 4).
According to the bill, its logic was that by issuing citizenship documents, a person signed a promise to comply with Russian legislation - by embarking on the path of extremism - he broke that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the Dumian factions, Vladimir Vasilyev (Uni-Russian), Gennady Züganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Just Russia) and the Speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been revised again.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will determine the procedure for the swearing-in.
Previously, parliamentarians had intended to describe the procedure directly in the Russian Citizenship Act, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event would take place - the list of places where a Russian coat of arms could be placed is governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
It could probably be the registry.
A solemn pledge of Russian citizenship will be made once officials have checked their documents.
But a Russian passport will be issued to a person only after the oath of office follows from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath must be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
There is a rule under which persons who are incapable or have limited legal capacity, as well as those who cannot say, read or sign the oath themselves, are released from the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "others" from this procedure,
The updated draft law also lays down a special procedure for the admission to Russian of Ukrainian citizens who are considered to be Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an application to that effect to the Ukrainian authorized body.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be given to Russian officials.
Renunciation of "other" nationality will not be required, as it is now, if it is provided for in an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the person."
A group of deputies proposed an amendment to the Act, including the first Vice-Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poclonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all "One Russia").
I think many of you know that it's not realistic to get a certificate from Ukraine, just impossible.
Consequently, very many people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding Russian citizenship, " explained the head of the Thought Committee on State Construction and Legislation, Pavel Krascheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had given up "other" citizenship in writing and had passed their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but "for reasons beyond their control" he had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, from being employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Nor can a person with dual citizenship or residence permits of another country become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of the Federation.
The law is scheduled to enter into force on 1 September 2017 and the necessary by-laws must be in place by then.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in "America's Starfleet" and "Detective's Trade."
The current iteration of history nostalgicly recalls both the glorious days of characters in the 1980s; the era of grandeur in the 1990s (about the time that distinguished masters David Wayne and Michael Schualter made a comedy of "State" sketches for MTV); and of themselves - that is, 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd, moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the rise and the fulfillment of our era, with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
The first day of the camp was surprisingly good, not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of the talking vegetable bank, which H. John Benjamin put forward).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only just reached the age of majority, making the inability to return a part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults were playing adults, had less emotional roots, and its parodieness was more ad hoc and included riffs from the 1990's Stacker movies, such as "The Hands rocking Cradle."
In one episode, the character gets the Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
A lot of story moves are the same.
Good-will Coop (Showalter), now a writer, has yet to obtain reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't broken up with his virginity.
And there's also a crazy and vile conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter) is involved, which George W. Bush now incites (tested parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is a departure from it.
It's particularly funny to see an eternal young Rudd singing Matt Dillon's song from "Lonely" whose character, Andy's former big man, looks like an old man now.
To bring this franchise success would be random madness in the spirit of "Seven Up"'s recursive show until it comes to what I think would be its logical conclusion: "A hot American summer: 20 years later," where in the last stage, the entire company would go to the film premiere of "The Hot American Summer."
Comrade Detective in Amazon is talking to a different type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the Americans, the Explosive Blonde, or even the Blizzard, with its East and West struggles.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: the 1980s Romanian police drama of two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninian path.
The main roles of the life-sighter Gregor and idealist Joseph are played by Florin Pierresic Jr. and Cornelio Ulich, and their dialogues in English by Channing Tatum (a.k.a. executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are some visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess game, how Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voice-overs - Jenny Slat, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny among them - lets you play "Know the Voice."
But the Comrade Detective is holding on to the truth of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - which is often what it looks like.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not often.
If we were to make it shorter, the Comrade Detective could better handle his agitprop satire; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary Communist audience, this image tells us that Western culture can make fatty out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do this even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The Russian Super Bowl football prize fund between Spartacus and Locomotive will be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (SFPL), Sergei Preetkin, at a press conference.
According to the head of the FRPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that there were almost no tickets to the match to date.
The Spartacus-Lokomotive match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 9:30.
According to TASS, Spartacus is the current Russian champion, and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Uphims cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Uphim with a furniture firm approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the plant, causing serious damage to its production.
The prey of thieves was made up of instruments with a total value of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a winch.
Order guards began searching for criminals and soon went to residents of the Bashkortostan district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years of age.
According to the press services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the premises of the enterprise, broke into the front door and took out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they got.
They had already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement had been able to return only a portion of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's comments on the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work together.
This statement was made by Heather Nauert, the official representative of the State Department, in response to the two-State remarks made by the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US ended the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on those words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were "low" but noted that "areas for interaction" should be sought.
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," quoted by the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the Russian Prime Minister ' s statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed last Wednesday by US President Donald Trump.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "Growed" roses from amethysts and quartz
The division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - added to the collection of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three velvet rings.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and necklaces of amethysts, pink quark, and diamonds were produced in the technique of gliptics (manual carving by stone) and pawage, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by the roses he had grown in his estate in Granville by the modeler Christian Dior, and by the gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan in Paris.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump strongly criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
On the eve of the day, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will affect, in particular, Russian banks and power companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the US to make profitable deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenya, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to the RBC with the intention "to focus on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be a "best investment of time," despite the investment appeal of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the consortium NorvikBank Grigori Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceryiv in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
Sberbank was one of these financial organizations - in addition to the TBT and Vnesheconombank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
At the Russian Ministry of Energy, the reason for the blackout in Crimea was described.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, explained what had happened.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in Krasnodar Krai.
The truck hit the power transmission lines in the accident, resulting in the shut-down of the Kuban and related Crimean networks.
Power failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts corrected the malfunction within a few hours.
It was initially reported that blackout could have been caused by abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have made rumors of possible increases subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
Professionals of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 against 2 in favour of maintaining rates of 0.25 per cent, with fewer members this month in favour of higher rates because weak economic growth weakened support for higher rates.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that higher rates in the next few years would be necessary to control brackish inflation, and stated that it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the Committee also voted in favour of abandoning part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of brackish.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it has reported that it is now to provide another 15 billion pounds - up to 115 billion pounds - under this plan.
In a protocol to decide on rates, the bank said: "According to the main forecasts of the MPC, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while pressure on the real incomes of families continues to influence consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that inflation would require "a little tightening of financial policy" in "a little more" than markets expect.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be "slow" and "restricted."
Bank growth projections for this and next year are lower than those for May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to US$ 1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth rates weakened the expectation of an increase; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to rise slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households that were hit by high inflation and very little wage increases: the bank said that pressure would increase before falling.
The Bank added that financial policy "can't prevent" money gain in the next few years, but expects wages to be "significantly" restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also driven by the growing demand for British goods due to the low rate of the pound, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was made one year after last August's rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of the European Union exit referendum, which resulted in a pound fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on the rates, there was an increase in noise around the anticipated increase in rates, as inflation was increasing pressure on already heavily pressured households: three committee specialists asked to raise the rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent, from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that it was expected to fall and that in the coming months it was again compensated.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco's Mortgage Brokers, said, "In view of the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good end of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of the absence of a commission, as well as with low rates, is becoming more popular than ever."
The Public Health Service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
From September onwards, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV-prevention drug after the battle in the High Court for funding the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex pill that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the Health Service during the initial three-year probation period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ruling last year, which stated that the National Health Service had the possibility to pay PEP despite her claims that she should be funded by the local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was called "the most important innovation" by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it "a turning point."
Before the full launch of the program all over England by April 2018, the Venerology dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register, and more will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of pre-sex drugs to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that PPE significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PEP before sex in a person's system, there's enough specific drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for medication include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
The dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender persons and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status is restricted by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practice doctor in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Venerology Clinic participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug deal this week after an international procurement bid.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of the PEP by collecting clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, on its absorption and on its use on a large scale.
"This crucial innovation must complement and reinforce the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the major health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, stated: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEP, if well targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to reverse the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV will be able to access a new opening-up tool that a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to improvements in many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said, "It is now first and foremost necessary to ensure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
Now that we're equipped with an experimental drug called ProP, we're going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV."
The Shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgson, said, "We very much welcome the start of the ProP test, which is very late because of months of delays and delays on the part of the government."
The evidence shows how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and putting an end to the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PPE.
It is now important that the test be deployed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution supporting the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a well-established form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "have played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Let us recall that, since 24 July 2007, a contract between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only federal entity with a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one called the "president."
In Russia, international driving licences have become difficult to obtain
The HYDD units are in short supply of international driving permits (IDVs).
To obtain such rights, it takes weeks to wait, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to travel abroad in their car or rent it.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are laid down in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on a particular police force or rental office: some require IDPs and others have enough national rights.
In order to be safe, drivers do receive international rights, but it is worth bearing in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all HIDDD units, reports Commersant, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
In Moscow, for example, the IHYDD units simply do not issue tickets, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but it's already extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained "for technical reasons" without going into detail, but in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation is emerging in other cities.
The problem has already been encountered by many Moskwichs, and social media reports have become more frequent:
Irina Burmistrova: "I wonder why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow."
That's right, 'cause all HIDDD departments are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to people who know!"
It is urgent to obtain international rights.
In Moscow, it's always a long way ahead, and there are no tickets at all (the button is there, but the ticket cannot be given).
I think the public service portal shows that Spb is free to shit.
Did anyone try to get it in another town?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being supplied to the units of the State Inspectorate.
This may be a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are involved, but it has not been previously reported.
Blanci buys the Traffic Safety Special Purpose Centre (TSC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and then supplies it to HIDDD units.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the Goznak AO: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016 and 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on 18 July with the First Printing Court OO for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a theory that the CDC just didn't get the tender in time, which created a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people went to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, etc. - rather than Europe.
It is not clear what rights are taken there, which is why people are over-insured, so there is a pressing demand for international "stuffs."
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take the examination to prove their qualifications.
The Mintrans made such a proposal.
The new International Driving Permit (IMA) has been in force since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Minister of Justice Pavel Petrenko stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, 4 August, he told the observer in an interview.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or bolt in it because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan - countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"I mean, in my deep belief, there is virtually no prospect for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he considered Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller objects.
I know that since the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already been destroyed.
"So I think the best tool in this situation is the sanctions against companies that are so shortsighted to join the project," the official said.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a set of car arches of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kirchen shore, a large assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: it is closed at 45 metres from the base of the structure.
"One-time bridge constructors prepared a rail arch for installation on fairway supports," reported at the project's information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
In Spain, an official who hadn't gone to work for 10 years was fired.
What angel patience (or absolute indifference to public service) did the chief Spanish official, Carles Resio, have to have?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was dismissed.
But not his direct superior.
There's no reason why bureaucrats don't happen in the world.
The traditional people seem to have been used to all the pranks of "people's service."
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, "sensation" came from Spain.
There, an employee of Valencia Carles Resio's archives managed to stay away from work for ten years.
At the same time, he received regular pay.
It's worth 50,000 euros a year.
And now Mr. Resio's "weird times" are over.
He was dismissed by a decision of the Valencian legislature.
The investigation revealed that a vicious truant came to the office every morning at 0700 hours to check in on the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he showed up at work at 4:00 p.m. to check in again on the system that he had left.
It's been 10 years.
It was also revealed that the skipper spent all his free time drawing comic books at home.
The members of the Valencian legislature are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Resio's immediate superior, who could not help but know how to "work actively" in his workplace.
Judges are offered protection from presidents
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC) has drawn up proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the court presidents and to introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts which will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential commission.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the council members.
A meeting with the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, inter alia, isolated cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see 9 December "JS").
The HRC ' s work has resulted in 25 proposals that address both the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of court presidents to enhance the independence of the rest of the judiciary.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judiciary, the President of the Court must, in the view of the HRC, submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases to the judges.
To do this, to allow experts, may have a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the President is not entitled "to determine the results of the judge's qualification, to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him or her, and to decide on additional financial payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move on to "the election of the judges themselves" and to "reliance their powers for a relatively short period of time, with mandatory rotation."
All presidents of courts (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes a new organization of appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that "it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional courts in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts."
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have "judicial districts" which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use "telephone law."
HRC suggests that the magistrates should be strengthened by the people's assessors to deal with certain "civil and administrative cases" with them.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's only our proposals," explained SHRC member, Constitutional Court judge retired Tamar Morshakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate had not only been with the HRC, but also with the Supreme Court (HJ), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the SC to carry out the assignment (between the co-implementers, the Office of the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Lebedev, President of the Supreme Court, is due before 1 September.
Living a high life: Semi-tage and sneaky design techniques turned this little apartment in Earl's Court into a large house
Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repair, moved from a large house in Nightsbridge to an apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a beautiful, like-like, Queen Anne's house, and in favour of a new design, it says that Joan didn't pack her things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Nightsbridge on a much larger square," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and there were these same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first view, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex design - to get into the bedroom, to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and semi-ethage to maximize the benefits from the generous height of the ceiling.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed architectural design studio in Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be fit for Joan.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-ethage where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brift.
"The work with steel structures is very complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they would be one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they would be at the right height and allow for the use of space from the top and from the bottom."
This solution allowed Erfan to set up two full rooms one above the other in the space allocated - and many more interesting.
From the semi-tage through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius," the view of the fine living room is at the bottom.
Mirror furniture with gold cutters, silver accents, and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muy set up the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding sight, space and light.
The short corridor is surrounded by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror shield seems to be a window into the other room.
At the entrance, mirror closets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of luxury, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a moving up door, like a garage.
"The engineering art has been involved here," Erfan tells me about the fibre-film-backed wood-film door.
"It's a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, the floor area is exactly what you're gonna sell, that's what your real estate is valued for," says Erfan.
"Bruddenly speaking, the real estate agent will enter and calculate on the basis of the floor space."
Here, they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house," says Erfan.
"No one falls in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts."
This shows that with a good design and an extended meter, an apartment can turn from something normal to something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Russian Government has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the Government's website.
According to the paper, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also draft a cultural policy strategy, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation has been appointed head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitri Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the strategy of the State cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries and to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also help to create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 fell to the minimum of eight years.
Consumer price increases in G20 countries have fallen to the lowest levels in the last eight years, as reported by The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index was 1.7 per cent.
In the past, Rosstat reported a decrease of 0.1 per cent in the consumer price index in Russia.
The department thus recorded the first week of deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, however, believes that the target has already been reached, with a 4 per cent target.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal Taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on the environmental development of the natural territory of Baikal.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskaya, noted that a bill had been drafted earlier.
It permits logging during fire suppression, and the Government plans to accept it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored to ensure that the logging process was "not shut down in a row."
Donskaya noted that the draft law required monitoring by the MES and supervisory agencies.
Media: VSU fighters negotiate secretly with Donbass militias
There is a regular telephone service in Donbass on the armed confrontation line.
Fighters from opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and they don't know about it at headquarters.
The VSU and the Donbass militias have established cell phones in secret from their high command.
This is reported by the Country.ua on 4 August, with reference to the members of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on a daily basis.
Communication is not domestic: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements."
The result of such conversations is often a truce in a certain area of the front.
Journalists have learned of cases in which an officer received congratulations on his birthday from the front line, from his or her formal enemy.
The VSU and the LNP and LNP militias have been sitting in trenches on the line of distinction since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has outraged the blocking of UNS reports of attacks on the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
In the Russian foreign service, the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives which block statements by the United Nations in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Syria are outraged.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It was recalled at the office that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was the third time in a month that the terrorists of the Heyat Tahrir Al-Sham groups (former Jabhat Al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Faylaq Al-Rahman had fired mortar shells at them.
Bearing in mind that the international community is unanimous in describing Nusrah as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the Security Council call for opposition to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation stated that "it goes without saying that the terrorist acts of Nusrah must be universally condemned in an unequivocal and decisive manner, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as emphasized in the diplomatic service, "for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine on the United Nations Security Council alternately, varying the tone of the objections, covering up arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council statement to the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should be on the conscience of those delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to engage in new provocations and terrors, gives them a sense of impunity," stated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have a conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of exceptional business tests
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, stated that the number of unannounced inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, and that inspections should be limited to 10 days.
"Unforeseen inspections are generally carried out without the approval of the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2 to 3 per cent is agreed with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and everything else goes by itself," cited by the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from removing servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This will hopefully be a positive development in business-related or business-related cases," said the Head of State.
According to JT, the moratorium on scheduled inspections has led to an increase in the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, a survey commissioned by the Russian President ' s Business Ombudsman, Boris Titov, found that scheduled checks had actually been replaced by exceptional checks (the proportion of those who encountered them increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and citizens ' complaints (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers fight for an estate empire worth more than $500 million.
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million - 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of Carlton's football club and developer Colin de Lucis lives in the Thurak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still having a violent dispute about the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew up in a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lucis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns about one third of the company's assets.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section offered by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best pieces of property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court hearings took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which Paul thinks Colin expelled him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of certain facilities.
In Colin's testimony at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes that the dispute will be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are increasing as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are added to the case; both parties have attracted the best known lawyers, including the Crown Counsel of Allan Myers, and the best cookers.
Mrs. De Lutís and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they have been running milk bars and gastrons, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
With financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the final years of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) " at the time.
Anna De Lutís says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi often told me he didn't want the brothers to judge," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis' group of companies; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unsatisfied with the financial terms of their branch."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Board of Directors and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGeere, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied with a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and talk about the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a statement that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see me and Paul arguing in court," he said, adding that "still hoping for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, that hope seemed to have receded.
"Our case is about to be judged," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the Chief calm.
That's what the reporter Josh Dawsie says.
"At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, with the Chief of Staff on his first working day, he identified a major problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better able to make decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite true, but others have already failed in trying to calm Trump down by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television started decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he received fair publicity in publications that could be reconvinced," said Sam Nanberg, a former electoral staff adviser, "Polico" in February.
Tara Palmery then wrote in "Polico" that "in order to control Trump's Twitter habit, six former electoral staff members said it was necessary to make sure that there was a constant flow of praise in the personal information he received."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of Twittering was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these electoral staff members know something we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweet would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweet that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one always managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their subpoena by giving Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico," just to that story, wrote in May about the tendency of the advisors to constantly give the president questionable information.
Here is one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who's behind them.
That was the case at the end of February, when someone handed the president a printout of an article with GotNews.com, the website of Charles C. Johnson's Internet Provocateur, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsch was accused of "sitting behind a leak" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is always on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he hasn't presented specific facts, or that in the past he started false accusations, and then he turned them down.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Welch."
Goldmacher adds that then Chief of Staff Raines Pribus and Secretary Rob Porter "tryed to build a system to control and document the flow of the paper that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may be a better manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive, and his associates are still fighting for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor ' s Office is fighting against an HIV dissident.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky District Court of Tumen, which terminated criminal proceedings against a local resident whose daughter died of HIV.
As a result, the child is said to have died because the mother is HIV-dissenting and has refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her of her responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the father concerned.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tumen was brought under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (cause of death by negligence), in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4B.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," explained the Prosecutor's Office in Tumen province.
The criminal case was filed with the Kalininsky District Court of Tumen, which decided to terminate it on 25 July.
The deceased girl's father made a request to do so, explaining that "he has forgiven his wife, has no claim against her, has made amends and has apologized."
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be revoked and re-examined.
The girl died, and the harm caused by the crime cannot be repaired.
The HIV-positive mother, contrary to the doctors' recommendations, refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection," reported the prosecutor's press office.
According to the Supervisory Authority, she should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents would follow her example.
According to the Tumen AIDS Centre, some 12 children living with HIV are currently not receiving medical care due to parental refusal in the Tumen region.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the special group's work, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV changed their opinion - allowed diagnosis, started taking drugs," said the AIDS Centre's spokesperson, Elena Loseva.
She said that it was not possible to legally influence parents, and not all HIV-positive children were detected as a result - mothers were not allowed to examine them, were hiding, and were fleeing with children from hospitals.
What are the risks of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Health professionals and AIDS activists of the service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and their spread is seen as a serious threat.
The terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the railway station of Grechana in Khmelnitsk.
A fun company of buffeting young people was walking a bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea of making a spectacular selfie on the roof of the wagon, reported to FACTAM in the communication sector of the police in the Khmelnitsk region.
The guy started coming down from the bridge to the train, but because of his negligence, he got caught on the power line and immediately got electrocuted.
Fortunately, this incident was reported to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an ambulance.
Before the doctor arrived, the victim was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in the burn ward of the Chmelnitsk Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with 1 to 2 degrees of torso burn.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that in recent times extreme selfies on rooftops, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
The police encourage people to be vigilant and to avoid such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the oceans to exist in ancient Venus.
There could be oceans on ancient Venus.
French scientists have made such an assumption.
Experts have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the formation of water on the planet's surface, and they write Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of Venus's history, there were oceans with 10% more water than it is now on Earth.
Previously, the Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign researchers have concluded that a water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting, passing on the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them took a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, since they had closed everything but their eyes.
Another was provided with medical treatment, after which he was released.
The third victim is a minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place for local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during shootings at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the premises.
Louna's rock band will present a new album in Barnaul.
The Louna rock band's concert will take place in Barnaul on 17 October.
Musicians will present their new album "The Wild New World," which became one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The collective is preparing a concept show that will be the most vivid in the concert history of the band.
The New World is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is related to O. Huxley's famous novel "O wonderful new world."
The new songs do not rewrite the book, but talk about a society that lives under the law of anti-Utopia, "leaking its faith in propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to collect money for the recording of the album: on Planet.ru, the project was supported by more than 1,200 people.
Louna released her first album, "Make Louder!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released "Time X," and in 2013 they recorded "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, Louna released the Symphony Orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the "Songs of Peace" program.
The group consisted of Lucine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bas guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinsbourski (drums).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club Faraon on October 17, at 7 p.m.
The ticket price is 1,200 to 2,600 roubles.
Louna is one of the requested bands on the Russian rock scene.
==History==The collection was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The band won a number of hit-and-runs at the Fucking Dozen.
The Gypsy crossed the moat and returned to the millionaire street.
Some of the wealthiest West Midland homeowners are once again in conflict with the strong Roma who have overcome the mortuary dug by the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field next to their homes.
The Gypsy parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solichalla, which is jokingly known as the millionaire street.
With horses, babies and lots of houses on wheels, they came back after they were kicked out no later than May, and they were not prevented by a moat dug out by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a break-up in the defense facilities and pushed its vehicles through a site that was left unguarded to leave room for the path.
The angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihall, saying that he was "incompetent to solve the problem."
An anonymous local woman said, "They came here on Monday night after being driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act because it is unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsy were here in May, they were chased away, and they came back again.
Last night, more gypsies arrived, and today perhaps more.
"The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and this attack continues, please."
This time, there's more of them, and we've even seen a horse come to the meadow."
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and cooperate with the Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them away as soon as possible."
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
The crime scene is the new world's champagne wine factory.
The "New Light Champagne Wins Plant" of the Republic of Crimea has been decided to act by converting the "New Light Champagne Wins Plant" into the UAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in Crimea's public domain.
The equity capital of the company would be 595.5 million roubles and would consist of 5.95 million shares of a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if funds were not available for the upgrading of the plant in the next three years, the plant would be in danger of being stopped.
The wear and tear of the plant ' s fixed assets is about 60 to 70 per cent.
In order to modernize the enterprise, 1.2 billion roubles are required, and due to the nature of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It's difficult to get money from the owner, it's hard to talk about borrowing from large credit organizations," said the subheadings of the minselhos of Crimea Sergei Pethelin last April.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the 2017 privatization forecast.
It was suggested that he should be acted upon and tendered.
The source of Interfax in Crimea authorities estimated the possible value of selling the business at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization at $30 million.
The New Light increased the production of game wines by 2.8 per cent in 2016 from the 2015 level of 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
==History==The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a gaming wine factory in the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The lower-urban third graders defeated more than 40 tombstones
Members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Nizhnygorod region identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the town of Liskovo.
The third-grade students were the perpetrators.
The first allegation that the gravestones had been damaged by unknown persons was made at the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Lukkiv region on 27 June.
A total of 24 people contacted the police on this matter.
As a result, criminal proceedings were instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, entitled "Destruct, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects and found them to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing monuments fall, and that led them to hooligan acts.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone against the ships of NGOs saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," said Home Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning was issued the day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rette on suspicion that his crew actually cooperated with traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had been working for only one year, had rejected comments on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now," says the organization's social media statement.
"We will only be able to assess all the charges now, after we gather all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa belonging to Jugend Rette since October.
His crew is suspected of taking migrants on board with lifeboats that traffickers sent directly to them and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as alleged by the prosecution, whose contents were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the zone, more from humanitarian zeal than from any other motive.
The Code of Conduct requires mainly that courts of the Juventure type will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS, and Pro-Activa Open hugs from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not cause any "significant change or interference" in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last few days, we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict."
The Russian Federation authorities have recently significantly intensified their policies on the Libyan track and, with visits to Moscow, delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been involved.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal Lebanese settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dongov, described the objectives of Moscow in the region and on whom he was betting.
The contact group on Libya that you are chairing is hardly known.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here, there's a veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Dums' deputy from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in Libya as Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The formation of the group was prompted by the detention in Libya of a Russian tanker, Mechanik Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 persons on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group was formed from military experts, representatives of the State Duma, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led her?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the team.
Our activities were not limited to the release of seafarers from the Chebotarev Mechanica.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the United Nations-recognized government led by Faiz Saraj is based) and from Tobruk (a parliamentary seat that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya Vice Prime Minister), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian seafarers.
At that time, it was agreed that a contact group should be established to make better use of these contacts.
Its mission is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and to engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to stress in particular that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all of us.
How many are in the contact group and how many are in Libya?
There are now five members of the contact group.
Among them are people with experience in the security sector, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include in the team of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the RAN.
No one of our staff is in Libya on a permanent basis, and that is not necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group has ex-military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities closed to a certain point, such as Misrata (where militias are based, which played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi in 2011 and have increased markedly in the years to come).
We arrived in Misrata in January this year.
We were scared, said it was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation on our own, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what the rumors are, what is really the role of Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the units that were involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from members of the banned "Islamic State" in Russia.
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to verify that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of IH in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed it to himself.
And what's your conclusion?
The Islamic State won not Haftar in Libya?
He didn't do it.
Haftar was operating on another front in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte fought the structures that were under the authority of the government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgwardia.
You are, as we understand it, in all of the Libyan regions, and you are probably imagining the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that it will be possible to implement the ceasefire, the elections that took place in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken down, hostilities will resume, the parties will attempt to seize power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar had agreed to another meeting was a good signal, not so long ago, that was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was on board the Russian carrier Admiral Kuznetsov that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our challenge is to show that we do not support only Haftara, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level make it easier for him to study twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, he's very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian perfectly.
And they reach out to Russia, they're kind of nostalgic about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course we are, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be on an equal footing.
With regard to the arms embargo, there are constant calls from Libyans for Russia to contribute in some way to its lifting.
The constitution-making process is well under way in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections are to be held, as was said at Saraj and Haftara's meeting.
If elections are held and legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties now has such a status), it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the United Nations.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now, which will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Could Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftara's troops will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the south of the country.
In this regard, the tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the southerns stopping the flow of migrants in the distant fields?
So, technically speaking, they're turning back the buses that Nigerian migrants are taking?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring the southerners together in the negotiations between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see the unity of opinion between Haftar and Saraj on this issue.
The head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered to be an Islamist who advocates the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not stand in the way of a relationship with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but it is its own position that Libya must be a fully normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, with legislative, executive and judicial powers.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all their cards and started to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobrook.
And we are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with Libya's state-owned oil company, NOC.
The NOC director, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, came directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell it.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
In plans to re-sign the contracts entered into at Muammar Qadhafi.
These include previous transport agreements (rail construction), energy (electrication) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, this is a "oil-for-service" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the most important thing.
We're actually doing peacekeeping there.
What is important for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans reach an agreement so that they can establish order and that Libya will no longer be an enabling environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task - helping the Libyan people and pushing terrorists out of there.
Do you have any information on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that to date there are no Russians and other countries of the former USSR.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya) and that the Russian speech did not sound there.
What states are these militants from?
I wouldn't want to go into that.
Then let's put the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans, no more than 5%.
The rest of them are foreign.
Could Moscow hold an intra-Livian negotiation like Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have indicated their readiness to come back to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such a negotiation take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are yet to take place, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the benefactors raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Mazola, who has a CDC, a hydrocephalus of the brain and complete blindness, will receive a special treadmill as a gift on 5 August.
A useful presentation is given by Sasha, the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosarov, and the director of the Konstantin Bobkov Museum.
The money for the gym was collected during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good," which took place in Melikhov on July 15th, Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino of the Czech district, received a letter: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a ride track as a gift so my legs can be strong and I can walk a little bit."
So Sasha's dream came true!
After serving in the museum, the "Concert Postscriptum" - a famous pianist, well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Gindin - will perform papurri from popular classical works.
During a charitable marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Voznesen Davydov Desert performed, calling the workshop of Ilya Drozdihin, students of the Moscow Conservatory of P. I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesin, and artists of the Melikhov Theatre of the Czech Studio.
The visitors were auctioned, book fairs were organized and souvenirs were sold with marathon logo.
The Melihovo Museum has taken the initiative to make the Chekhov Memorial Day on 15 July a single day of charity in all the Podmoskov Museum.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk in Zhitomir oblast near a local football stadium shot several times at the youths who were there.
According to the suspect, he was pissed off by the noise, reported to FACTAM at the Zhitomir Regional Police Communications Department.
The man then went to a coffee shop nearby.
He had a conflict in the building in which a man used rubber bullets to shoot off a visitor.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police officers and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
He's got a rubber-fired gun that's been sent for forensics.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.
The detainee is facing a prison sentence of 3 to 7 years.
Let us recall that an attack took place in Kiev on Lukyanovka, near Tatarska Street, on the night of 28 July.
Sent by Michelle Carter for reports that led to Conrad Roy's suicide.
The Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment for having encouraged her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide by means of text messages and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and five more years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers stated that she and Roy both suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the judgment standing, with her hands tied and her eyes lowered.
"In her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor stated to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monice said that, in his view, her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a visible impact on her actions."
The Prosecutor read the statements of Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying, "It has not been a day since I mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I'm doing - I'm trying to support his sisters despite all the pain that's gonna stay with us forever," he says.
Roy Camdin Roy's sister said that she was constantly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"Lying to a man who's always been with me since I was born is a pain that stays with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as Massachusetts does not have a law that would hold a person responsible for advising him to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know if there are many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before his death while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she said, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted attention by means of Roy's death, and forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the legal profession on this matter were divided.
One of the few protecting Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of killing her British flatmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, a 30-year-old, published his separate opinion in the Los Angeles Times, saying, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugenius Bogchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players in the One WB league, 33-year-old Keith Langford left CENS.
The departure of the U.S. Advocate for Izvestam was commented upon by the President of CENSa Evgeny Bogchev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, " told Eugenius Bogachev.
He has a little baby, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I've decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played at CENIS for three seasons, and in each match, he showed a high level, he was 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and career.
Keith Langford played the club for three years, winning silver from the Single League 2015/16.
In the 2016-17 season, he won the award to the most successful player in the Euroliga season.
He scored 21.75 points on average for the game.
This is the second result since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, informing Eurohops.
An American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroleague in July, and will enter the Chinese Championship.
==History==In the past, Chinese CBA moved to Yannis Burusis, the ex-centre Panatinaikos.
A sun-burned tourist from Podmoskovya was evacuated by a helicopter in Adygey
Adigean rescue workers today evacuated from the mountainous region of the Republic a foot-and-mouth tourist who received the strongest sunburns.
The man was resting at the Fiszt shelter, located at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
A 27-year-old tourist was under pressure and breathing difficulties.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescue team was approached by the head of the tour team, who said that the man had been burned while on a camping trip.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that it would offer software upgrades in over 350,000 vehicles.
The Chairman of BMW stated that the company believed that "there were more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," with reference to European cities - including Munich, where BMW was located - that were considering the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Thursday that he is modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their move a review.
European automobile manufacturers actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to vehicle manufacturers of equipment neutralizing diesel vehicles is also rising and it is difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of condoning powerful automobile manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which masked the use of so-called "flood devices," which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to conform to the rules and were shut down under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Volkswagen were convicted and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and can stand trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, "Audi" was placed under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused "Audi" of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may cause serious problems for Volkswagen: an elite car manufacturer is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor paid off with fake money.
The police received a report from a branch of the bank that a suspect bill of 5,000 rubles had been found in the conversion of funds from the catering centre.
A study conducted at the Centre for Forensics revealed that it was false.
According to the Russian UMVD on Astrakhan province, a visitor to a coffee shop bought a shaurma was paid in a bank note.
It should be noted that the cash register was not equipped with a bill of lading.
The police are currently identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a known fake ticket to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls on the people of Astrakhan province to be careful in the execution of financial transactions; it is recommended that the workers of commercial establishments should install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers found a "Hell" planet where even iron can melt.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, the astrophysicists were surprised by its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glowing water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the planet's atmosphere glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called hot jupiters - gas giants, which are comparable in size and mass to the largest planet of the solar system but which are dozens of times closer to the parent star.
This year's exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas envelope is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of dry weather and disease-borne insects; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Ches, an expert at the CREPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: "Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk, because in recent years this plant has been affected by the effects of climate change: in the spring and especially in the autumn, the rains have become much smaller.
It affects the life span of the lavender.
And there are also small cicades that jump on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteriums; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavand is not only attracted to vacationers; lavender oil is very useful in perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Ches says, "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent.
So we have fewer parts that contain ether oil."
The solutions currently under consideration included improving water distribution and reducing evaporation from soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and producing more drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador Winter Universales 2019 met with the Redish schoolchildren
The two-time hockey champion of the world, Ambassador Alexander Semin of Winter Universales-2019, met with the start-up hockey players the previous day and gave autographs to fans.
The meeting took place at the Winter Universe 2019 in the context of the theme week of hockey with the Shiba.
Any visitor to the tent could ride a skateboard on a pad with artificial ice.
In addition to this, there were relays, quizzes and games with the prank of souvenir products of the student games, and a warm-up from the aerobic federation.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on the playgrounds and stressed that the most important thing in the early stages of education was hard work and a great desire to do hockey.
"It's nice to have a site in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter Universe 2019, where beginners can directly ask questions to team coaches," said the champion.
It should be noted that Ambassadors of the Winter University 2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among the Reds.
The university charter will run throughout the summer season until September 25, reporting to the press service of the Winter University 2019.
In the State Department, the words of Medvedev were commented upon.
U.S. State Department spokesman Heather Nauert, commenting on the briefing by Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, said that there was a need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas must be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation."
Nauert referred to the Syria Armistice Agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
Nauert refused to comment on Medved's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, it certainly has the right to say it, but I can't say anything else about it," said the representative of the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of the Russian Federation, Medvedev, stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Beardev also stated that US sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the U.S. establishment, considers Trump to have played "purely."
A missing bodybudder was found on someone else's house who lost his memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very picant circumstances: he left the car salon to go to the bathroom.
Seven days he was sought unsuccessfully by acquaintances and locals.
And there was Shamil on a stranger's dacha in Ramenski.
The owner found him naked in his toilet.
Dagestan's athlete couldn't explain how he ended up here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
I.D.'d his missing persons.
The medical personnel who arrived at the call detected a partial memory loss and a brain injury in Khanmetov, according to Mash's plaque.
There's probably other surprises waiting for an athlete.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues generated in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, as reported by the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar against the ruble compared to the monthly average of June used for the valuation, as well as the excess of actual gas production and the export of petroleum products at projected levels.
"The deviation of the federal budget's oil and gas revenues from the monthly estimate in accordance with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected at +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017," according to the Minfin report.
Thus, the total amount spent on foreign exchange purchases on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency would amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Russian Bank will be involved in foreign currency purchases by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Every working day during the said period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases on organized tenders of the Moscow Exchange on an even basis during the trading day.
Foreign currency acquired will be credited to the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underlines that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The staff of the weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to highlight the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa State related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown at them in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal sensations would suffice.
They're drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a list of scoundrels that make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give a break, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are growing in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Henrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdes Cárdenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdes showing the middle finger, with "justice" on the front of the Riodoce building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smile, face in glasses, or his brand-new panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office had been set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases had so far been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-trafficking and organized crime-related killings each year, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed with grief, though far more dangerous now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left Riodos' office in the capital, Culiacane.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Coroll was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River."
The shooter drove his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children left.
Rumors usually go fast on Culiacán.
But there's almost nothing about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that every day one or more people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated double-story mausoleums of drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that a state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of the Maritime State with important ports and routes of drug trafficking leading to the US.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, was crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso López, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who is fighting the sons of Guzman.
The publication may have pissed off the sons; the people who were allegedly gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story had been seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been running out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and in 2003, along with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest publication, sales, and advertising income.
Journalists liked that they were able to publish bold stories without fear of censorship, but that readers were attracted to reading about things that no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Morse Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for courage in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it goes.
He admitted frankly that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
A drug dealer in Sinaloa - "it's a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rumpeviento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff miss Valdes, a joker who fought like a trucker in a port, a friend who was generous in his arms and counsel, a teacher who knew how to fight.
They relied on their order.
He should always have worn his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
And now they ask, "Did love for the order of one day destroy him?"
His death made them question how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know about their wives, their children, their legal businesses, and clandestine drug airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from something that smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodoce, Andrés Villareal, is that "the smell can be tricked... and then what happened to Javier happens."
Old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoce's security officers gathered, cell phones were suddenly banned: a few days before it became known that spy programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and social activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadow of a tree of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Culiacán.
Some journalists asked half a joke whether those police officers were part of the 50 per cent of the order officials the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next issue, Riodoce had three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of the former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chávez.
They also exposed government spending concentrated in the governor's home town.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacana, a block away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who had been abducted or how it happened, so caution should have been exercised when it was time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of government for almost the past century.
Recently, a number of PRI governors have been charged with high-profile corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo Guzman escaped the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdes' column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We'd already know what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his thin body called "El Flaco."
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
Valdes' office is now being used as a poster and sticker store to protest against the murders of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office the following morning on another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán, in the west of the country, three days after Valdes was killed.
They found the burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak out loud, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to secure international support for the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdes Ramirez was murdered, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that she no longer be assigned to cover the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would harm its objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, her accomplices in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters were not just being killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they did so on the orders of politicians and security services conspiring with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were directed by the police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her head cut off.
Some publications chose to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent, Miroslav Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to hold out as El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly approached drug cartels through an editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they continue to see danger on the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as apparently happened to a photographer, Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, along with four women, in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work strike a daily balance between risky solutions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, Riodoce's publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office drinking beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 dead bodies confirmed.
The war continued to fuel, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
On the sidewalk, they posted the news via their mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
The next day, I had to rewrite the first page.
The sirens were raised nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the policemen guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
While sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was placed in the eyes of all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff continued his work.
"How can you think about shutting down," Bohorkes said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first sight, it seems to be a statue, although it is terrifying.
Researchers have told us that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of the Rhino, discovered by a Canadian miner, were preserved so well that experts called it "My Lisa Among the Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the colour of his scavenger skin was reddish brown - and say that he had, in a way, a dark past.
In a report published in Modern Biology, it was described as "the best preserved from Tyreofor in the history of discovery and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world."
This fossil is a recently discovered copy of a nodozaur that lived in the middle of a chalk period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune was stunned by researchers who call him "very wonderful."
This herbivores Tyreophor is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of discovery, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at Sancor's Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He bumped into something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and he decided to look more carefully.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was under way to locate an animal inside a 2,500-foot earthworm.
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
"It's worth a little bit, and you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creature is shown.
"He'll be in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most well-preserved copies of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
In studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivores, even though it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, appeared to be at great risk from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used protective equipment known as protective colour, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to interact more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, 110 million years old, belonging to the Nodozaur family, was widely publicized in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Palaeontological Museum.
The scientists have already studied the animal and have given it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum labian Mark Mitchell, one of the band members who spent more than 7,000 hours in his laborious dig.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective colour, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective colour is quite common, the discovery was unexpected because the size of the Borealepelta dinosaur far exceeds the size of the animals currently living with protective colour.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to mask confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective paint - such as deer, zebras, or armoured animals - are much smaller and more accessible prey, indicating that nodozaurus had to struggle hard to survive.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mel era were," said Brown.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur scales also indicates that his skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the remaining contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and its back down to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread far deeper than they are now.
"This nodozaurus is truly remarkable because it is covered entirely with the remaining skin, while remaining completely in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did in the early mellow period.
You don't have to use imagination to recreate it, just a little bit, and you can almost believe he's asleep."
The mellow period is a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, wandered around the Earth.
Although the most wonderful of them, the tyrannosaur rex, lived millions of years later than Borealepelta, a Tyreofor could be hunted by some of his formidable ancestors.
These include an acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet [1.5 m] long, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose most recent discoveries are published in Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the world's best preserved tyrophorus, along with skin and shell, and it's intact, from the face to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their mark was two 20-inch spikes coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivores Tyreophor was a hard thing to do with what is now Canada until the spilled river took it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur saved his shell to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the tumultuous shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security "is rare as winning the lottery."
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossil remains of the skin still cover the tumultuous shell plates that sequester the animal's skull.
His right foreleg is stretched along the side, five fingers are turned upside down.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to enter Poland without papers
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then Odessa oblast in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
However, he did so without identity and citizenship documents.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw uprising against Hitler's forces in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topic of Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland, as well as Ukraine.
An opal politician learned that the Ukrainian migration service had deprived him of his citizenship while in the United States.
It is not yet known how he managed to make the transatlantic undocumented flight.
Former Governor of Odessa province, Mikhail Saakashvili, previously stated that his signature on the application for citizenship of Ukraine had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any forms.
The investigation of Weinziher and Olhovik was extended until January
The pre-trial investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova group, Evgeny Olhovik, and the head of power holding, Tlus, Boris Weinzicher, was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, an extension of the house arrest is pending before the Basman Court.
The SC representative reported at the meeting on the decision to extend the pre-trial investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to remove and examine a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigative activities in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation," the investigator stated.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the management of Komi.
Their total size is estimated to be at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olhovik, as well as Mikhail Slobodin, former leader of the Integrated Energy Systems of the ZAO, who until 5 September was the head of the Vimpelcom company, paid bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting maximum favourable rates for thermal and electrical power, as well as for creating an enabling environment for business.
Weinziher and Olhovik were detained, staged in Sektyvkar and arrested for two months, and Slobodin escaped the investigation and was declared a federal wanted man.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the heart.
Only one day after arriving in New York, on a tourist trip, St. Louis's lady sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at Facebook tape on her phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Notice that no one else in her tape posted that information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and Twitter.
Her tape contained a lot of hit-and-runs with @TheePharoah.
The rapper from Big St. Louis was tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old teenager, murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, scattered in the street, where it will be held for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't something new to her and her circle.
She put off her phone, and then she went back to the tweet later that Canfield Drive was getting people together.
There were pictures of signal tapes and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father, who took the poster and said, "The Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, she said, pulled the trigger and yelled, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals!"
"It's an unusual situation," Ferrell said in her own memory.
"It's not a murder like the ones we used to call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying."
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
She landed at 11:00 p.m. and took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next almost three years was the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," which will be released on the screens on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was on her way to Ferguson with a daughter dressed as a flower and wreath, they remembered a conversation that had been conducted before this morning on countless occasions, "the experience of blacks and their situation."
She recalls saying, "Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong."
"I couldn't help it," said Ferrell later.
"What happens today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
It must not only have a good understanding of activism and organization, but also an understanding of the different levels of black experience and their positions, and what we must do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I kept her away from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made on South Florissant Road, at a playground across the street from a police station that turned out to be some kind of tent camp while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's ultimate innocence.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
A little bit in Ferrell's mind, a new type of activism has taken shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she had been president of the Association of Nursing Students, National Minorities, and had worked on food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I didn't have the experience of the organizer.
It came by itself."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her directors.
Folayan said that she and her main operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrair "just wanted to document" the event.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story to play?"
This skepticism was driven by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the centre of attention, and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already merged with his co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project with Ferrel and six other local residents with whom the team of the Whose Streets Project had been in touch for the years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, that's what we say," said Davis.
"It was the most important thing to me, how these people will be represented, because it's how I'll be presented myself."
Although the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "it's not about the rescue leader, it's about how the community unites," as Folayan said, it was the most open-ended of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" shows the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrelle's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing about the first time she saw a ready product.
"But I realized that when you do this job and you humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's story once again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of Black Life Matters.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Trevon Martin, in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership support this whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we're always fighting on several fronts.
Black-foxed homosexual women have to bear the burden."
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of homosexual black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she was in the first place because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there are no film cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there are complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrel's gonna be on probation for two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that she calls home, just "Bardak."
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she walked into Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players were disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador's football players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disqualifications for unsportable behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the North and Central American and Caribbean Confederations of Football Cups (CONCASAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
The first one was Henry Romero's protector.
The Salvadoran bit Josie Altidor's assailant, then pinched him by the chest.
Seren's semi-defendant then bit U.S. protector Omar González while putting a corner in his penalty square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with a 2-0 American victory, transmitting Goal.com.
It's a resemblance: an artist makes portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA.
At the center of the hall in Friedman Gallery in New York City, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire - white, black, and brown - all of which are elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were made by Heather Dewey-Harborg, an artist, of cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving 35 years for the famous broadcast of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "The Resurrection of Similarity."
It's the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harborg, whose art unites technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama reduced the sentence just three days before the end of her presidency.
By analysing through a computer program the DNA obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a profound, though difficult, manifesto on not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the ingerent determinism of these interpretations - but also the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from her teens, openly said she thought she was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her pictures in prison were not available, so only one picture of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, where Manning was wearing a platinum wig, apparently embarrassingly, while driving a car; she was associated with that photograph.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed his 2012 vision of strangers project.
In it, the artist created pictures of unknown people with forensic evidence such as butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from it and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary screening of a new press exhibit.
At that time, Chelsea could not be seen and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made of her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her muse in prison became pen pals and exchanged letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Destructed Images," illustrated by Shoily Kanungo, who illustrated how the president would ease Chelsea's punishment in the future and she would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama actually decided to release Manning only a few days after the release of the book turned out to be a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something deep and strong about the exhibition opening right now, when Donald Trump announces war to people who reveal classified information in the government, and invents new ways to create on Twitter a feud that he's supposed to mitigate.
When Dewey Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all of this over time, she said that "nothing happens by accident."
In a statement by an artist written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature downstairs (with a heart instead of a point above "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic division based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientific artist has done), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how we all look amazingly similar, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't define what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation, and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video work, "Lange Memories," is also posted here.
"D.N.A. can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in the same room is the above-mentioned novel in the comics.
In it, the King Kong Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Czar with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So don't ever shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have the creeps when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally yet - as visualized in the comics - but when it arrives, she'll be welcomed by masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulaks gathered as crowds of protesters.
It's also done intentionally, just like everyone on the exhibition up to height (5"2, height Manning), where a pencil was painted with a genetic gapl group.
"I'd put them on the walls earlier, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey Harborg says about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that was formed around Chelsea as a movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professors at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University are wanted by the police on a murder charge
According to the police, a nationwide raid is being carried out on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects because a man was stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the records of the Cook County Court, warrants of detention were issued on Monday for manslaughter without bail for forty-two-year-old Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, Cornell Duranlo, aged 20, died after he was stabbed with multiple stabbing wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says that the body was found on July 27th.
The cop got a call, they came to the Grand Plaza compound and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating death from stab wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Liaison, stated in an e-mail application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to visit Northwest University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the commissioners, and North West University is cooperating with the investigation," said Kabbaj.
Warren works as a senior finance officer at Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: "We spoke with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities."
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The Chief of Communications of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Gulelmi, said that he strongly advised the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing," reported Gullemi.
According to Gulelli, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulelli, the police officer called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The cops called the crime scene awful.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the security footage confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were bonding," said Gullemi.
The Grand Plaza Manual issued a petition to residents, which stated: "The police are currently working on the timeline of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map soon."
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled shortly.
"RUSADA has reached a certain stage in meeting the requirements and has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly," stated Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore compliance with the Code, which listed the conditions for the resumption of RUSAD ' s work and had recently been published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA soon," he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly acknowledge the results of a WAD-ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sports was controlled by the State.
On this point, Mutko said, "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we're not gonna admit what wasn't."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with Russian Rsport Smirnov, Smirnov acknowledged earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivier Niggly, stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" towards the restoration of its work.
Fire in a 79-storey tower in Dubai was put out
The great fire that took place in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, is being put out, and is being transmitted by Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters were able to cope with all fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 ms).
The local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
During the extinguishing of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for the incident are not yet known.
It was previously reported that there is a 79-storey building tower in Dubai, The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All the tenants were evacuated on time.
Buzova's incredible outfit shakes fans: pants that don't cover panties.
Olga Bouzova's Scandal live show "Dom-2" hit the audience of Europa Plus Live in their underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, a new-found duet singer with Nastya Kudrey performed the song "We're gonna be hot."
Both girls went on stage in provocative "trousers" made in such a way that the underwear of the singers appeared to be visible.
The trousers were marked by Buzova and Kudry.
It was previously reported that a specialist from a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on the changes in Buzova ' s appearance.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, by Radio 4 News, citing foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "stabilization in eastern Ukraine."
However, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was possible and that further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that US-Russia relations were at a dangerously low level and accused the US Congress of doing so.
The Metro of Ekaterinburg is learning a new way of paying.
In October, a bank card could be used to pay for the journey in the Ekaterinburg subway, as stated by the CEO of the I-Set, Pavel Vedernikov, in an interview with the Regional Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce the same subway fare as other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk to the 2018 World Cup.
"We want supporters from other countries, mundane guests, to be able to use the subway with their bank cards without getting badges or standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber.
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his e-commerce start-up staff, but the polls weren't working.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, insincere.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
"He has never been consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs a 75-person company called Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, engaged in electronic trading in hair care.
She therefore sought the help of third parties.
A new type of personnel start-up is emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct rapid interviews, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints and, in some cases, to allow informants to pass the top management and direct contact with the Directorate.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analysis programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett told me that she's gained a better understanding of what her staff think and feel in three years of using Glint.
In addition to the rapid surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are slightly aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber who was caught up in a scandal when a former employee posted a post on a blog that described the aggressive environment in which those who complained were punished.
For startups like "Glint," it's a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for profitable businesses.
The Internet portal Let's Talk About Pay, which is dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry may cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The "Convercent" launch from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of a decline in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individually commissioned staff opinions, collect confidential real-time responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report bad behaviour.
And if the top manager is involved, the complaints go straight to the department.
"The Court of Public Opinion seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
Quinlan reported that if it was found that the company was ill-treating employees or was unethical, even if the inspectors did not intervene, the company might face costly consequences in the form of client boycotts, staff departures and lawsuits.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 institutions, has been using Convercent for over a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to propose a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if a staff member wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or head office e-mail, file an official complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, reported by James Vitrano, the head of the legal department of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to follow up on employees' complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, haracement and unfair pay - can be quickly discovered and addressed.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Quinland, companies began to take employees' ethics, values and involvement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical irregularities caused by Dela Enron.
But it was only when "social media spread massively" that companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading virally online.
" Before starting using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies for their products on a regular basis.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has won the approval of venture capital investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
"Glint" received $10 million in November from "Bessemer Venture Partners," bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more jobs than they did before.
In markets with hard competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only a necessary minimum.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they are devoting their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in a company, they feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do produces results, they try more to make such a company successful," says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both "Convercent" and "Glint" are used.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies do well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase staff commitment and involvement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks employees for feedback, it might give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not occur quickly enough or at all, frustration may develop and staff will lose interest.
"If you're gonna ask for 4,000 offers, you should be ready to have 4,000 interviews," says Russell Rat, the president of the management consulting firm at Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Cause if you don't go all the way, the staff will be wondering, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly interviews with employees, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees who were unhappy with decision-making speed and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help it to better retain employees in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose companies.
Barnaul's opening a new asphalt on the Krasnoarmian Prospect.
In Barnaul, a major effort was made to address the cause of asphalt failure on the Red Army Prospect.
The location where holes appeared twice on a newly-paved carriageway (a youth street crossing) is decided to "open up."
Let us recall that the destruction of a small section of the road near the trams was caused by the passage of land in the vicinity of an unexploded network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the Urban Committee on Roads, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey would be conducted to investigate in detail and eliminate the conditions for collapse.
Depending on its outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that the re-establishment and concrete of the no-owner ' s comms will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
The Bruins team has to study longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11pm; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles are being held up to chat on one side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some of them pulled out their T-shirts, exposing their backs with sweaty sweat after a tense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these moments of idleness are a midday break.
The players recorded for summer classes will return to the dormitories after three hours of training to prepare for the final exams, and will return to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
Just before Monday turned into Tuesday, team coach Brewins Jim Mora said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meathouse."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working day - at least until Friday's exams.
So the start of the first three training sessions of the University of California team in Los Angeles was set at 7:15 p.m. to fit in an already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings per day has increased the number of days with one training, and Bruins moves the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of Maura in Westwood.
They are scheduled to conduct 18 training sessions up to and including 20 August before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the University of Texas A&M team in September.
Maura said that he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, even though it made another point in the player's schedule.
"For three or four days, we've been giving them this huge load, this is a serious test," Maura said.
"And they've just overcome it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's really gonna be great."
When the camp ends, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the trainings closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed by footballs that have passed the safety net behind the gates.
Brewins players should be staying at the hotel from this weekend, but Maura says that when rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We're gonna have security," Maura told me.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can rent a room, sit there and record training on video.
If you have a video recording of practice, it's very serious.
But we're gonna have security there and we're gonna have security in parking lot 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of the attack in Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All the victims were discharged from hospitals during the attack on the St. Petersburg subway in April.
This was reported to the press by Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
At the end of July, three people remained in the inpatients, transmitting TV to the Centre.
Let's recall that the explosion in the St. Petersburg subway took place on 3 April this year.
The bomb was detonated by the suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
Fifteen people died as well as the perpetrator.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer of Abror Azimov, were arrested.
On the previous day, Rosbradzor had recommended that the St. Petersburg Metro review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against fake news.
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystification to independent experts and show their findings under original posts, declared on Thursday the world's largest social network trying to fight the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mistifications, send them to check and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which so-called fake news has been disseminated, and many believe that it has influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports before the May presidential elections, and in Germany, prior to the September elections, they expressed support for a plan to impose fines on social media if they do not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a new fact-checking algorithm had been tested and launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what messages are disputed by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook news manager in her block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "connected articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeese," and in the 1970s and 1980s it was a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But for 700 years from his cozy place in the Bühl Valley in Kent County, he was watching a violent story around him, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire with coke hair and a tendency to historical documents, to a novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel that way in person when you hold this letter in your hand."
The castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwards and describes the families who lived in Scotty; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists Isaac Lenkevich, Broney May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dead Man's Tooths and Other History," a collection of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him deeply.
"I could've just gotten a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days they lit fire.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
Oh, I love archives!"
For a man so passionate about old papers, to get support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and live in the castle for four months (to be honest, I've been a little bit in there) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives, and looking at the many treasures of the estate and old things - such as the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles that have been lying in the mouth for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, spoke to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on illustrations to his book.
Then at night, he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
Scotty's castle history is not very well understood because the National Foundation only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhodes arrived there ten years later, the staff had just begun to deal with the archive, which he described as "the things that the aristocrats had been in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what you thought was boring, says Rhodes, but two families fought for this birch.
It happens, you guys!"
In some of the stories of the castle collection, it is becoming the starting point for broader research in English history: for example, in the Workman, the hero is leaving the castle that has just been built to join the 1381 Peasant Revolution.
"There is evidence of a riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called "Kent and Sussex's Knightly Families," Rhodes says.
"The Crestian uprising began in these places, and I thought the riot was a fitting beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the castle's history, such as the Holy One, which describes a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist," about an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was discovered several years later when the coffin was dug).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of all the people Scotty had: "The gentlemen seemed to be a perfect cheat, always in debt and spending money on something they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of cute guys who are able to care for big estate heirs."
After finishing his job at Rhodes Castle, he looks for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish interior, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmäki, a place where a sanatorium was in the early 20th century, and then it was regrown by the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life."
The top 15 banks choose Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK Openie, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, those organizations that have withdrawn from ARB will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just an exit - all the banks that announced the breakup with the ARB are negotiating with another social organization that brings together credit institutions - the Russian Association of Regional Banks, which is headed by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the outcome of the last session, and the most effective head of the Thought Committee and deputy in terms of the number of bills prepared.
The outbreak of conflict within the ARB was the result of discussions in the Federation Council, when new bills were being considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular with regard to the new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunian, President of ARB, stated that the association believed that the bill was being passed to the benefit of the major banks, which were thus attempting to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other complaints included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, but was objected to by the representative of the CB: many of the managers of the corrupt banks, such as Vneshprombank, were part of the ARB ' s governing bodies.
It seems that this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has become a visible occasion for the top 15 banks to start preparing for membership in the Russian Association, noting that "the performance of the ARB will be low and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is virtually non-existent."
The depositors will be better.
How's the case gonna end?
We will answer immediately the main question that arises in or near the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector: depositors are not in danger of anything, but rather the reliability of the banking system will be enhanced.
He is the head of the "Rossia" by Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued at the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the Association's annual events, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through expert evaluations of the "regionals."
Human resources and organization are also clearly not expected to experience major disruptions.
There is no doubt that ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation when such powerful and influential actors are deprived of their contributions and lobbying power.
However, this oldest organization, established in 1991, which advocates the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking law and monetary treatment in general.
Nor can it be said that in the open arms association Russia is willing to accept new members under any conditions, judging from the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("may too much want"), who, on 21 July, in a briefing in the press centre of the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that "literally the following day, representatives of the banks of the ARB asked me to consider increasing the potential of our association, Russia."
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of the Association, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiation process is under way, proposals from both sides are being studied, and an extraordinary conference of the association is being held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair is not holding," called George Luntovsky, the possible new leader of the renewed association "Russia," who is leaving the post of Vice-Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his vacation and arrive in Moscow for one day at the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of Russia.
The entry of petrol-powered vehicles into Russia's major cities will not be restricted
The deputy head of Mintrans, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered vehicles into Russia's major cities would not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually upgrade the environmental class.
And there's a concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, what year is it?
It's a slogan-like phrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Are we gonna shut down the whole town?
"In 20 years, I don't know if it will happen," says "Prime."
Previously, Izvestia reported that, by 17 August, Vice-Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorković had been charged with examining the proposals on possible options for State support for electric transport submitted to the Government by PAO CEO KamAZ Sergei Koggin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, are the use of LAN vehicles in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump announced that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted that would change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions on the granting of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who own English, have the financial resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the American media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
Before we could think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots came out.
Yeah.
Sex robots are at the center of attention right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharki, the well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR's co-founder, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of nipples, and the type of fingernails.
"People giggle about it, but firms are already sending it to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see more," said Sharkey at the launch of the new report.
Today's sex dolls evolved from their inflatable fellows into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human lines controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also set their robots to their own taste, choosing from the color of their eyes and the shape of their robot nipples to the shape and colour of their fingernails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personal person" compared to which Stepford's wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to adapt to robots the qualities they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also the Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which are supplied with an already programmed identity - such as the Cold Farrah, which seems shy, and the Wild Wendy has a "gold" character.
"Roxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," enragedly reports True Companion.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't love, and so on.
She's changing her mood throughout the day, like a real man!
She can want to sleep or talk, or she can be in the mood!
In the emergence of sex robots, much is worrying - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most concerned about the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the Cold (read: resisting) Farah to take hold.
On "True Companion," Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetish or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, moving away from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with subordination as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and aggressive until the free market gives them the chance to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complex sex robots came into existence precisely when women's rights around the world were threatened when there's a president in the White House who boasts about what's coming on to women.
The scariest part of the TV series, The Handmaiden's Tale, is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and shredded eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big now.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to feel like people to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's their "character" robots that don't look like real women.
They can't break up with or leave their partners.
They have no life, no biography - anything that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The native of L.A. Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been pro-Ukrainian since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, Andrei Lebedev, the general manager of the blue yellow portal, reported this.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I will recall that with Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine's team was ranked number six on Eurobasket 2013, and for the first time it was at the World Basketball Championship, where "yellow blue" failed to complete the group phase and a native of the United States averaged 15.4 points, 3 rebounds, and 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped playing for Ukraine's team since he left his post as the head coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left his post in 2015.
The Eurobasket 2017 will run simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will play their group tournament on the promised Earth.
The wards of Eugenia Murzin will have five fights in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team held two auditions, giving way to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
To pretend to be Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the common feature was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers ran columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-hand poet from Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trump's White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she's been arguing about politics for decades, has suddenly and strangely been on the same side.
At dinner, it's certainly good; but I can't help but think that, in a broader context, it might be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed his powers into the left flank, but the distorting effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll be no longer struck by his misdeeds.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump and both seem very evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will have enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park - the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best way in town to spend three dollars unless you need caffeine.
Horses are formidable and enormous, glass fibre pictures on the central drum - glittering clowns and animals who look at their back in horror, extremely sinister, and the ringing music, oddly enough, is depressing.
So many known things in this city are disappointing: the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are too much to cause awe, and the reality of the city is not keeping pace with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I found out that the Suisse Cottage isn't really a Swiss chalet (the "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" pub), but a big roundabout in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old kid, a 11-year-old kid, and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could give the carousels a grade, I'd put a five, but luckily no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" purchases on a scale of one to five stars before I could run a terminal card.
The coffee shop on my street is still the same plus the option of tipping 15 percent is for ordering at the counter.
This not only slows down the perceived neutral interaction, but also has to be personalized in a situation that does not imply it.
Poor shopkeeper at the department store smiled at me when I was tired of assessing my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital because of chest pains
Pistorius is leaving prison for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat the wrist cuts that the prison administration claimed he received as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecution ' s appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine ' s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of a toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his friend was a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office had announced its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretoria may be extended by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor ' s Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beat-up of a journalist, NTV, has been selected to sign a non-exit.
The city's law enforcement officials chose a restraining measure in the form of a travel ban for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Rozjayev during a live broadcast from Gorkogo Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Wolf.
"In the context of the investigation of a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code ("Battery") against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a correspondent of a television channel in Gorky Central Park for Culture and Recreation, the suspect was given a preventive measure in the form of a signature of non-exit and proper conduct," Volk explained.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative report had been drawn up in respect of the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, a drunkard man approached the correspondent during a live broadcast on HUD Day and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully had nothing to do with the VCD.
According to Rozzaev himself, the paratroopers, on the other hand, tried to detain the Moscowman.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the BBC, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia, placing tents in an unsettled location, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the BBC that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and have already imposed severe fines on anyone caught standing in an unauthorized place.
Checks will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court could impose a fine.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the US Vice President of the cold war rhetoric.
Statements made during the European tour by US Vice President Michael Pens were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly falling into the primitive ideologically engineered stamps of the cold war, which are completely separated from reality," says the statement of the Russian foreign policy department.
In this way, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to Pens' words about the "Russian threat" and attempts at forced border crossing in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of "either with the West or with Russia" and the lack of clarity of the theory of the alleged non-alternate entry of the whole of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that had violated international law by using force to disassociate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call upon American colleagues to stop Russia's strangulation and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests," states the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Feldsher was injured in an ambulance accident in Podmoskovje
The accident occurred in Stupino, an ambulance was hit by a paramedic.
Today, around 08:10 msk, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow oblast.
"As a result of the crash, the ambulance turned over," said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow province.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident and the circumstances are being clarified.
In Odessa province, a woman threw her newborn son out of construction, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident reported to the Segrenian Police Department that he had found a package of infants in an unsettled private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly took the child to a medical facility" reported to the Odessa Chief of the National Police.
The medical team determined that the boy had been born hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a cord.
In the course of the priority operational investigations, a 36-year-old local woman has been identified.
It has also been established that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously been seen by law enforcement officials and had not been given special consideration.
The circumstances and reasons that prompted the woman to do so were being determined by the police and a procedural decision would be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a waste line.
Grigory Leps: "I'm fighting, but 55 isn't 30."
One of the most successful artists in Russia is Grigory Leps to celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke to the columnist "Iztea."
I remember your 50-year-old.
The special tent at the Liars, Gloria Gainor sang for the birthday party, is a powerful salutation over Moscow River.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five-year-old.
Did the plans come true?
As for the profession, it was a good time.
I've worked hard, I've toured the country three times, I've been giving 120-130 concerts a year.
Made two good albums.
Of course, right now I'm not the same as, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock can't be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting heavy.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first one in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're going to send it to a show in L.A.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" according to the same song that was written with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we're done with the video.
And the album will be presented in November for a series of my anniversary concerts at the Moscow Crocus City Hall.
A great American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand on your new record.
I think you wanted him on your tour, too.
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (known drummer involved in various projects).
But for a long job in Russia, they offered, to say the least, excessive conditions.
It was about fees ranging from 35,000 to 45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space as well.
And I found a great drummer, Max Littleev.
It's better to feed her.
Sometimes I want to fight with one of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
It is written in Western music magazines and invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come with another performance machine."
Your album's coming down in L.A., American musicians working with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm honestly not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers working on this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I've told you before that I'm studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful you get.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our players in popular music for 70 years did not have the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They wanted the best possible sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'll still apply every year for a visa to the British Embassy to be allowed to go there again, and most importantly to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me well.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a registered one, but a public one, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Room in Monte Carlo, and I was there once.
Now they're invited again, and as far as I'm concerned, all the tickets to the concert have been sold out.
At the Lyma Weikula Randave, which will begin on July 20th in Yurmale, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a great woman who can present herself with a beautiful voice and even whisper.
After the tour and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, this is the time you want to go to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You've already got two albums with his songs in the discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in the same play he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Jakovlevitch Rosenbaum on the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it works.
You gradually introduced Boris Grebenchikov's songs into your repertoire.
Why don't you write down his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I've run into him a few times and asked him if I could sing some of his songs?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to make them happen."
Please try and sing.
I guess it's interesting to record that kind of album.
So far, I don't have a problem like this, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do this project.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I guess before you realize his potential, you haven't signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of artists I'd dream of having under my wing, but they're independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and has his own development strategy.
And my center now has Alexander Panayottov, whom I led in the Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be truly a pity if he did not reach the heights that were worthy of him.
Trying to get him a repertoire, filming videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to promote other artists in my center: buying them songs, crying to poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they'll get a recorded album, a few videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return the money they invested in them.
Although I'd love to have one of them make commercial progress and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna shut down any oxygen.
Let everyone work, fight, prove as I once proved.
If tomorrow you're offered a tour of Ukraine and you're guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
And as for the big tour...
I'm a man of my country, a Russian, and I was convinced to fly to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they say you have to go somewhere else tomorrow in the interest of the state, I'll fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this is a situation that we have had with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry this isn't likely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine every year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is a real pity that they are not now able to fully tap their talent into a large Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian singer to Russia, like Slava Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I don't think it's likely at this point...
Andrea Ochlopkova was transferred from the cosmodrome
As I was informed, the technical director of the East Andrei Ohlopkov Cosmodrome began work at the Khrunichev State Space Science and Production Centre (GTSP).
He had previously been de facto involved in the construction of the East Cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Centre for Terrestrial and Space Infrastructure Operations (CENCI), he had been transferred to a factory in Moscow Philes, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the function is scattered across the units of the CINCI.
The fact that the Eastern Technical Director and Deputy Director for Technology Development of CENCI, Andrei Ohlopkov, went to work at the Chrunichev GNPC, was told by the top managers of several space industries, as well as by a government official.
"He's been working in a new post for weeks," they said, "I am" in the industry.
It was not possible to get a quick comment from CENI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information "J" has been officially confirmed in the GNPC.
He decided to take over the position of Director of Production Coordination, stated at the enterprise.
Mr. Ochlopkov moved to work at CENCI in 2013, serving alongside space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, at the North Cosmodrome, served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ochlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of bribery: the regional traders allegedly received it from its introduction for the rejection of government orders, but failed to comply with their obligations to clean the separated parts of the carrier rockets in the Archangel region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in CENI were extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a space station in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostepenko, in an interview with J, explicitly stated that the situation in the East "was critical as early as October 2013."
The fact is that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned at the same time to the end of 2015.
In order to implement the launch by the end of the year, the construction was completed six months earlier and the deadline was changed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be tricky: CINCI specialists had begun to install technology equipment parallel to undeveloped facilities.
The chief supporter of this idea was Andrei Ochlopkov.
Despite the risks that existed and the transfer that took place (instead of December 2015, the Union did not fly until 28 April 2016), this idea was justified, says the source "J" at the cosmodrome: "We would still not have launched any East but would have been building."
The Vice Prime Minister, Dmitri Rogozin, who was in charge of the creation of the cosmodrome, called Andrea Ohlopkova his "space Susanin" joked, but he was the one who almost always asked for information on the progress of the construction.
Remembering Mr. Ochlopkov's directness, for example, in an interview with J, he suggested that the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specialstroy) should be decommissioned as the only singer in the East and work directly with the subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in the same basket of Specialstroys?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENI has assumed the responsibility of a general contractor to complete the construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex by the fourth quarter of the launch.
According to JS, Mr. Ohlopkov's transition to a new job was prompted by disagreements with the leadership of CENCI on how to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as on how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be the best thing for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government official, in turn, calls the decision weird: "He was one of the best professionals, it would be difficult for him to find an equivalent replacement."
According to I, this would not be necessary: the post of technical director of the space station would be abolished and its functions would be spread across the units of CENCI.
There will be a programme for two specialties in music schools
In the future, children ' s music schools will be able to receive two courses at the same time.
According to the Vice-Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture of St. Holubenko, to this end it is possible to reread students ' recurrent subjects, and the issue of the payment of the remaining second specialty classes is decided by means of special grants to RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we will work with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow two skills to be mastered, but at the same time will not contradict existing legislation in the field of education," said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Needs Talk" with children at Sirius Children's Centre, the student Maria Andreeva reported that she had to pay for recurrent subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory's CMS.
The girl explained that she was in the violin and piano classes and had both awards.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian who climbed the wall into the skyscraper was detained.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Cyril N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, is being detained by the El Universal portal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The boy, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed into one of his towers on her own.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or ropes.
We've got a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security brought him down on the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out if the young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man climbing high has become popular online.
The users called the young man "spider-man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help to make the CDC easier.
Red meat and chocolate are usually considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammable intestinal diseases.
It is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 3000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colic and abdominal swelling, chronic or bloody diarrhea, loss of weight, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of triptophan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestines.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the intestine ensured that harmful germs from food did not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering an inflammation process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too heavily affected by inflammation, it can lead to inflammable intestinal diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacteria in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria need a triptophane -- one of the building elements of protein -- to trigger the emergence of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between one type of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of a normal intestine microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was kept in the diet of mice, the more these immunized cells they had."
He suggested that people would work the same way: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich tryptophane diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammable intestinal environment.
The postcard, Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganas, studying a variety of tolerant immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbioms of the intestine of mice - the communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the cells in the intestine of mice was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but missing in mice without them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that had no good microbioma and did not develop this type of immune cell were given L. reuteri, and immunized cells appeared in them.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transported small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
The immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of triptofane, known as indol-3-molecular acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophenes in mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of triptophones was halved, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that people have the same tolerance cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our intestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of the L. reuteri triptophane contribute to the growth of cells in humans as in mice, but in humans suffering from inflammable intestinal diseases, defects were found in the triptofane genes.
She says, "Perhaps the development of these cells needs to be strengthened, because the inflammation processes on the inside surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of triptophane with L. reuteri are potentially likely to increase their population."
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired "genius" in Nemania Matich
Manchester United hired "genius" in Nemania Matich, thinks José Mourynho after a midfielder debuted against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The game, purchased for 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin in the last pre-season match, "United" before the Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday, and gave an impression as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira went ahead whenever they wanted.
However, since Matich did not take part in the Chelsea Asian pre-season tour, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourynhoe, requires further work before the season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is the way he thinks, he thinks football," said Mourinha.
"We'll help him prepare early rather than late."
Just like Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku started playing at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his core by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a lot of work for me."
Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats are being persuaded to remain in the ruling coalition
The former presidents of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, the ex-premiers of Algirdas Butkjavičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Seima of the Social Democrats Çeslovas Jursenas, appealed to the one-party to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and Greens - have led to a debate in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
The three senior experienced comrades addressed the same party with an open letter saying, inter alia, "It is understandable that the party comrades are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has provided us with not very easy but still the conditions for continuing to implement the social justice objectives that we have initiated in the Government's programme and to preserve the political dominance of the left centre over the right-wing parties."
According to former party leaders, the debate has so far "belonged to an emotional expression of opinion without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party might lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by reckless action.
Disabled Anton Mamaeva was fined
Mosgorud reduced the sentence of the wheelchair invalid Anton Mamaev from four and a half years ' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from SIZO by a decision of the Timirizev Court.
Mosgorud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he had organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motorist from a former Special Forces fighter.
Mosgorud reduced the sentence of Anton Mamaeva to 200,000 roubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the offence, and accordingly the person must be prosecuted," explained the "I" spokesman for Mosgoruda Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took into account Mamaev ' s state of health, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which punishment may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would warrant a change in the gravity of the offence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgorud's decision.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, a fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out appeals against the judgement before the cassation court of Mosgor Su and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
Let us recall that 28-year-old Moscowman Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal figure last fall.
The disabled person claims to have bought a carroller from acquaintances for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former Special Forces fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timirizev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years of imprisonment and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years ' imprisonment with serving his sentence in a general-regime colony (under article 162, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code).
Following the placement of a disabled person in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Attorney General ' s Office, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO in mid-July by a decision of the same Timirazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgoruda.
ONF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final "Forum for Action" of the National People's Front (ONF) will be devoted to environmental issues in 2017, informed Izvestiyas about the source in the ONF and confirmed by the head of the Alexei Anisimov movement.
He said that the results of the forum were intended to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment and to propose a strategy to address them.
Izvesi interviewees at the ONF indicate that the report to the Head of State will contain a "deep analyst" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izves, the final forum of the ONF will take place in the autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined - it is usually aligned with the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key FN events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulaanbaatar.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will continue to be made at these events, we will develop systemic proposals to address environmental problems, as we told Izvestes to the interviewer at the ONF.
The Co-Chair of the Olga Timofeev Central Staff, who chaired the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that "frontoviks" would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the Action Forum of FN is likely to be combined.
In a year, we've grown into a powerful team of environmental experts, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "frontoviks" will also report on the work on the priority projects of the ONF, " told Olga Timofeev's "Izvestiyam."
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environment, environment and transport, Sergei Ivanov, would also be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months' time, the Year of Ecology will go down into history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they can work for years.
To keep these questions on the table, Olga Timothyev added.
The head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrei Koljadin, noted that, in raising environmental issues, the ONF was acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the President's support, " said Andrew Koljadin, "Izvestam."
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, the regions would be able to engage not only in solving their environmental problems but also in promoting ecotourism, added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the waste dump in Balashieh (already closed) and the coal dust in the port of Nahodka (a bill has already been drafted to prohibit open trans-shipment of coal in populated areas, one of the authors being Olga Timofeev).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, and the question is further enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
The head of the Ecology for All charity, Leonid Bochin, needs clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State.
HRC member Sergei Tzyplenkov, head of the NGO Greenpeace Russia, spoke to Izvestia, stressed that a responsible society and business approach was needed to successfully address environmental problems, and legislative efforts alone were not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, " noted Sergei Tzyplenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that the violation of environmental legislation was an economically beneficial solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car with a swing of his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office, and even start the car with a simple swing of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham has a tiny chip between his thumb and his index finger, and now, through his firm BioTech, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives by technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist and consultant from the Royal Winchester, to ensure that the activation procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip that implants cats and dogs, and the procedure only takes 30 seconds.
Northham's company also replaces house and car locks with a 300-pound chip per lock.
One child's married father has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House requisition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to bring a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One," when the president is on board, became the centrepiece of a White House event on July 17, where American construction programs were shown.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior White House officials examined technological products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was set up next to a yacht from Maine State, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a pick-up truck from Mississippi.
According to the first Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the helicopter control department, the White House Military Department ordered the helicopter to be present in a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to know that you're aware because it's an unusual, widely publicized event," wrote HMX-1 Commander in an e-mail to his superior, the Deputy Chief of Aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on 17 July to attend an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return the flight in accordance with working hours restrictions.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, while the unit ' s security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records received by TIME whether a second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the activity was in conflict with the regulation.
"We asked, among other things, if this wasn't a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it wasn't," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," said the deputy chief.
The event "Done in America" was announced by the White House as an official event and was not covered by Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the reform of the health sector, which was being drafted in the Senate at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's the only thing that's unusual to ask for a photo opportunism.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled to see "Done in America," where 50-state products made by American workers from American materials were presented," said the deputy White House spokesperson, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House to the nearest inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight for the "America Made" event was counted to the crew on the basis of the required training flights in a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks."
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
Sikorsky reported that Sikorsky did not participate in the organization of a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 fiscal year clock, the Department of Defense's VH-3D rate is $24,380 per hour.
The unit ' s records indicate that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield based at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
"It's totally wrong to calculate the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement," Walters says.
"These indicative rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations."
According to a study carried out by RAND in 2015, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, Sean Spicer, a former White House spokesperson, spoke out to defend the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show things done in America this week," said Spycer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
It is therefore, of course, entirely appropriate to draw attention to this."
It was unclear whether Trump had interacted with the helicopter by looking at the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky, making a press joke about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three."
Moscow will provide grants for resuscitation units in urban hospitals
Every year, the life-saving grants will be allocated to intensive care units and the medical clinic in the capital.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, visited the Udin City Clinical Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he presented a thank-you letter to the trauma doctor-orthopaedic Victor Protzko, who led a major operation to reconstruct the child's foot.
Sergei Sobjanin also described the decision to provide grants to intensive care units and city clinics every year.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the city commander, the Udin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new and modern equipment enabling its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Colombo Rural Hospital.
At present, more than 1,000 patients are receiving medical facilities.
In addition to intensive care and inpatient care, there are day wards.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800.
The total area covered by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical facility became a participant in a pilot short-term hospital project (SCP).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical intervention, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the time taken to rehabilitate patients.
After surgery in the infirmary, they only spend a few hours.
In the first half of the year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with in-patient care at the Udin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic ' s medical staff performed 15,800 surgeries of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported no buyers of the Ukrainian "daughters" of Sberbank
In the Nazbank of Ukraine (NBU), there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughters" of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, 4 August, with reference to a spokesman for the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, was withdrawn to negotiate the indirect (through Paritytbank) purchase of 100 per cent of Sberbank's shares.
"No documents have been received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank's shares in the NBU," noted in the communication.
On 3 August, a Belarusian businessman, Viktor Prokopenya, withdrew an application for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it was reported that Natsbank of Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Gutseryev and Grigory Huselnikov to purchase the Ukrainian "daughters" of Sberbank.
The regulator based its decision on the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported on the sale of his Ukrainian "daughters" to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceryev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceryev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of maternity organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, declared in the UN.
Elections can only be representative when they involve all members of society, including women, and are announced on Wednesday by the head of the United Nations mission to Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Heisom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the position of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of the international force from combat operations to the role of advisers.
This year ' s election is the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Haysome stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office confirmed the indictment in the case of Nikita Whitekh
The Procurator-General of Russia confirmed the indictment in the criminal case against the former Governor of Kirov province, Nikita Belykh, accused of having received a major bribe.
This was reported to the agency on Thursday, 3 August, and transmitted to RIA News.
The materials have been referred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, tourist fines were increased for inappropriate behaviour
The Venice authorities increased the fines for bathing in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around town in a bathing suit or with a naked torso, they will now be fined 200 euros.
One hundred euros would be required from those who would have a picnic in a public place or would ride a bicycle on pedestrian areas, to hand over the TASS with reference to the Association of Russian Tour Operators.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities impose a fine for writing 400 euros and 25 euros for garbage.
To inform tourists of the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice, a special company, Enjoy, Respect Venice (#Enjoy RespectVenezia), will be available on social media, as well as through ads and posters on the city council website, on billboards and in places where tourists are concentrated.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Tourism Adviser of Venice, Paula Mar, the fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the home countries of the offenders in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the traffic.
In Venice, the number of tourists visiting the city centre is already being reduced.
Instead of the 100,000 people who wanted to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

SF removed Lakes from the post of head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement of the chairman of the defence and security committee, Victor Ozerov, and dismissed him.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk region.
An application to dismiss him from his position was filed last week by the Lakes.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to change the rhythm of life.
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Victor Ozov has been representing the Khabarovsk region's legislative assembly in the FRF since 1996.
The Defence and Security Committee has been chaired by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheap for both residents and the Buryatya producers
For decades, the efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with Government Decision No. 842 of 17 July 2007 on amendments to the regulations on the wholesale market for electricity and power and on the consolidated forecast balance of electricity production and supply (power) within the Russian Single Energy System for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, has set indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buratia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Burundian producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have trampled on the threshold of Moscow's offices in futile attempts to level the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkutsk region with the stunt of hydroelectric power plants in Angar, emanating from Baikal, where Buryatya is the main catchment area.
And it wasn't until this year that things started.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rub/kWh to 3.93 rub/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Buryatya by decision of the Federal Government in the list of areas of the wholesale market price zones for which the characteristics of the wholesale and retail markets have been established, the industrial consumers have taken a turn.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays a kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to call the approximate date of the new tariff movement downwards for Buryatia.
Scooter wasn't afraid of the Ukrainian Attorney General's Office and flew to Crimea.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiling Workers (GMB) is concerned about capital investment in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union requires guarantees from the managers of the biscuits manufacturer McVitie's for its long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent on the issue of future investment at a Tolkloros facility.
More than 500 people work in a factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years she has invested over £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the work of the facility, employees and union representatives "shall be the first to know about them."
In a letter to the company's head of the facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's reaction to the concern that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy stated: "The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the general manager of the business needs facility and the investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the Greater Glasgow; this is a critical pillar of decent work in high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rise in the subsistence level and the chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs to flourish at McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, "The leader of the Tolkros site just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately because we appreciate our continued cooperation with the employees and representatives of the union."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We have spoken to staff that, as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tolkloros facility, especially production lines and improved performance."
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and if there are any changes in the work at this facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of the supply of gas to the Eastern Petroleum Company (INKC) should be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet, but that no one would give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosnefti.
So Russia's President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve these contradictions.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be based solely on market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC threatened the project's duration.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosnefti, but we don't have such resources, added Sechin.
It should be recalled that Rosneft requested permission to use gas from the Kirina Gasprom field, located on the Sahelian shelf, for the "eastern petrochemical company."
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on the issue were continuing and that "no sharp corners were there."
Did SPM warn Barcelona about Naymar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La Ligue may regret his interest in Marco Verratti.
Parie Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record of a raid three years ago?
The Sensational Proposal revived the summer transfer window when the League 1 club was prepared to beat the world record at the cost of the transition by more than double the previous mark of the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is over, Neimar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as SPM offers him a salary of more than £500,000 a week clean.
Barcelona is known to have been furious about the proposal and how Neimar broke up the contract, despite the fact that, as the source close to the Catalan club insists, the club has always done its best for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the PSJ?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in hiring Blaze Mathuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would want to lure one of the best players in the SPG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're gonna stand up to them, we're gonna propose to their players," said Al-Helaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in the SPM midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
SPG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player on any terms, and now it is likely that Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimara.
Putin has instructed us to deal with the payments to those affected by the forest fires.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has commissioned a study of the material assistance that is being provided to forest-fire victims and for the construction of new housing.
Today, I'd like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the status of payments made to injured citizens.
I have some confusion.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the Baikal regions.
On 4 August, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Moyilo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Glavrybvod FGBU, Leonid Mikhaylik.
They told me about the work on cleaning up the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open tank next to the container that was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released some of the boys from the tub.
Then he pulled a special lever on the top of the container and released the others.
Also during the visit, the leader commissioned an environmental survey on Baikal and the construction of a road on Olhon Island.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, one volume is needed and another volume is supposed to be required.
"I want to figure out what's going on in there with our funding," stressed the Russian leader.
In the course of the forest fires of 2017, the villages of Buryatia, Irkutsk province, were hit by fire, and homes and economic structures were destroyed.
In Ukraine, Russians were asked to go to prison for illegal border crossing
The Verkhovna Rada has registered a draft law under which criminal penalties may be imposed on Russians for illegal crossing of the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, the document registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian Parliament implies a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens attempting to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the term of imprisonment may be increased to five years.
If the perpetrator was detained at the arms border, the time of his detention would increase to eight years.
It was previously reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians attempting to enter Russia outside the designated crossing points.
Magnet's out in bulk.
The second-largest food ratinger, Magnet, announced the opening of three new Magnet-Opt test shops, which are designed to buy products in small bulk.

The project focuses on the HoReCa segment, the petty rose and the offices.
There will be two new territories in Russia that are ahead of social and economic development: Abaza and Novotroitsk.
The relevant decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The boundaries and economic activities of the TOR have been defined in the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Hakasia.
In a city with 15,000 inhabitants, there will be a special legal regime for entrepreneurship, as well as a minimum amount of capital investment by residents and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investment into the city, as well as more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities in which the Abasa TMA will have a special legal regime for business activities includes, for example, crop production, livestock production, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government has signed framework agreements for eight investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's dependence on the Abakan Mines Enterprise.
In January 2017, the authorities in the region reported that Hakasia had met all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the establishment of a DOT.
The authorities of the Orenburg region have done the same.
There, the city of Novotroitzk will also have an area ahead of economic and social development.
This will diversify the economy of the monocities, reduce their dependence on the Ural Steel Enterprise, create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract more than 8 billion rubles in investment.
The list of economic activities in which the new DOT will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, inter alia, freshwater fish farming, feed production, medicines and medical materials.
==History==Newtroitzk became the first single town in Orenburg province to be granted the status of a TOR.
It should be recalled that the territory ahead of development is an economic zone with favourable tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges that are created to attract investment in improving the lives of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the LTA are: a profit tax of not more than 5 per cent for the first five years, and not less than 10 per cent for the next five years, social contributions of 7.6 per cent for 10 years, the use of the free customs zone, preferential access to various infrastructure facilities, and preferential rental rates.
Losa called Manson a "bitch" and threatened to "get in the face."
Yuri Loza expressed his outrage at the speech of American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with "The Komsomol Truth," a Russian singer called Manson "the bastard" and "the bastard."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow such statements should not be invited to Russia.
Besides, Loza thinks that Manson needs to be put in the face for what he said.
Let us recall that an American artist, known for his epathetic acts, spoke harshly about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, the Arguments of the Week wrote that Manson's statement was commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigozhin.
