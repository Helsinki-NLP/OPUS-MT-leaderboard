National Strategy for Resistance to Re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the last myth to be one, arguing that cases of falsification in the United States elections are more rare than cases of death from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers have counted only 300 electoral frauds in the United States over a decade.
One thing can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing U.S. federal elections.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon took on a new dimension following the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require the voter to present a photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of the will, and deprive citizens with a criminal record of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo identity card.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo identity cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have an identity card bearing a photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo identity card.
But that's not all.
Students who are believed to vote for Democrat candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo identity card issued by their educational institution.
The same states, however, allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by those clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, a similar requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are United States citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at restricting the voting of Latin American nationals.
It is believed that two thirds of Latin American voters vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated legislation in 2011 to abolish voter registration on polling day in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction has not gone without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to register about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike Whites, who formed 76 per cent of the electorate, only 46 per cent of the voters were early voters.
Of course, Democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been mandated by the Democrat Governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended by the intervention of the United States Attorney-General.
This made it possible to limit in part the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the production of photo identification cards.
Nevertheless, the new rules that had come into effect would certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that have been enacted, with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 Brennan report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes required in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to claim that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: take a test or not?
In fact, the FSA test sometimes gives false results, false negatives, and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to go through a medical examination, there's more to doubt.
Shall I take the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies carried out in the United States have documented numerous cases of infection among the groups under investigation, so it is difficult to interpret the data and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates for patients who were screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasized is 30-40% higher for those who have not been screened.
So I would recommend taking a test from the age of 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and whirlwindy.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a long-term risk to life, but chooses, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend taking the test after all.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess all for and against the PSA test.

Prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle receptor to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were able to eat well and move sufficiently, 30% of cancer cases could have been prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," says André Bollier, the press secretary of the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to genetics.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite the decrease in smoking.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is causing enormous damage to human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says Press Secretary André Bolje.
An encouraging fact is that 10 years after the cessation of smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and direct intestine, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects from colon cancer," added to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
The sausage should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoke, drying or salt may result in carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explained the Association.
Vitamin
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But for the time being, the results of these studies are not clear.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies have produced contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
There is also a lack of clarity in assessing the impact on vitamin D cancer development.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family anamneses with the doctor.
"The test results in no cancer."
Higgs boson in detail.
Last summer, a report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused real agitation - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much.
Moreover, it is the last particle that has been predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or at least the least imperfect, description of the nature and behaviour of matter - but that has never been detected in an experimental way.
But physicists aren't quite sure it's the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Imagine, though, that this is the Higgs boson, because the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is one law in this world that is absolutely inevitable, stating that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to circumvent this rule, don't even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: the principle of excluding Paulie, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same point in time if they are in the same "quantum state" - a "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called farmers who wisely obey the Paulie principle.
In the other, the bosons, an abominable gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can end up in the same place at the same time.
According to Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, the site reports that these bosons are divided into two groups: mezones, which we are not going to talk about here, and "particles of power," by which the main forces of nature are spread and to which the Higgs boson in some way belongs.
These are the most bosons, it should be stressed, not all the exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronic, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or a "particle of light," which is an electromagnetic courier.
Indeed, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "fails" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, about like a stone thrown into a pond.
This "violation" gives rise to an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) and is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the "power transferors" bosons.
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with only the difference that if this boson were to appear, another field, the Higgs field, had to be broken.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it requires very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like the one used in CERN, the Great Adron Collider, a 27 km-diameter ring, is needed to achieve such enormous energies.
Analog with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as photon) do not.
So, what "can bring" all these studies, Ms. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between observations and projections of the CM.
In addition, some of them are eager to see such a discrepancy, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut some of the Model's holes.
The latter, to be said, still has significant shortcomings, not offering any explanation for gravity or for dark matter that forms about 80% of the universe.
But so far, CERN hasn't found such a discrepancy.
Consequences
The use of these studies for the everyday life of an average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs could not have even imagined what revolution their work would be.
They predicted their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Laboratory, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself designed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
In addition, an application can be found for tools to accompany the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical studies in 1969.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world and deserves the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate was about to resume, and a bill was being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
The Dolg tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monteregi.
Prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbois' palliative care shelter in White, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents people from going to the bathroom and even from eating on their own.
When he sits at a table with a delicious meal, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He's awake, even able to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, give him drugs, take him to the bathtub.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest desire for a cure for diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, staff found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we are taught that a man should pee standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbois' shelter.
Regression to the child's condition is an intolerable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a man's ability to deal with the decline," he argues.
Since many palliative carers believe that important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Predictions give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses is no longer providing assistance called the "medicine."
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die "in consciousness of strangulation."
But the disease did let me know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before I let you put a mask on her to make her breathing easier.
She is still waiting for her son to visit from Italy in the coming days.
At Victor Gadbua Shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutritional support.
That's the palliative care that stays when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Québec has one seat for every 11,700 inhabitants in palliative care institutions.
That's very little, considering we're all gonna die sooner or later.
This is where life goes on in the best conditions possible, explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors in the orphanage.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or mentally.
We'll agree to give the dying man a brandy or pepsi mouth bandage, as long as he asks.
We don't make diabetics control sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
His son drank that beer in the dead man's feet this morning.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Sawar, the director of nursing.
Victor Gadbua's orphanage doesn't look like the previous day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by parents, a wife and two young children, died tragically and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," Dr. Christian Martel says.
Fifty-three per cent of the patients admitted to Victor Gadbua ' s shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua's orphanage and the Big Montreal House Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this large gap in Quebec's health care system that makes many doctors who care palliatively fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and helps suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the flashlights in the area of palliative care, Dr. Balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating, demonstrating their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R. in terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Hélène Richard's hopes for survival were already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, " she says.
She told me myself that my days were numbered!
There's no full-scale care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are thanked by the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the director of palliative care in the Palliative Care Society at the Grand Montreal home, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of their lives, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Painful patients always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia," it means "I want it to make me feel better."
This report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia experts tell the story day after day of what they know about the huge "system" behind the construction industry, government employees, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
"Industria," which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"I'm curious how this system breaks down after all the resources have been put into action, and Jacques Duceno, a deputy and former chief of the Montreal police, is joking."
It was thanks to him that in 2011 a scandal broke out as a by-product of an investigation into official offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, for which the Prime Minister of the time was very reluctant to accept from the Liberals, Jean Chare.
The Duceno Report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out that the Ministry of Transport alone would have kept a billion dollars on contracts" if some had kept their instincts from taking a share.
The Charbonno Commission had "placed two mayors already," he added, hoping that it would be possible for it to "discover the schemes behind individuals."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, Molot's special unit, which after 2009 forced the Montreal " scrub cartel " , stopped overvaluing the contracts.
A series of searches had been carried out in recent weeks and some municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn is Gilles Wayancourt, who recently resigned as Mayor of Lavalle, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, several Montreal route engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akcuro and Lino Zambiato, were formally charged.
The latter blew up a real bomb by investigating the "system" for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambia had given 3 per cent of the value of contracts entered into in Montreal to a mafia-related mediator who, in turn, had transferred money to Mayor Gerald Tramble's party, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambiato spent money on the right and the left, transferring more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly to the liberals then in power.
He also admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Analysis contracts where value was overstated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked in vain.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the value of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they had been paid for their paws, raising the bills by 30 to 40 per cent with false supplements.
Mr. Tramble was then accused by an organizer from the mayor ' s party, Martan Dumont, of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party ' s funds with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned early in November, putting Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first members in Montreal to forget alarms.
The mayor of Rivier de Prarie County in the east of the island, she's been standing up since 2010 to sell a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold over 1.6 million to developers in the middle of a construction boom.
70% of the dirty campaign money.
She says that in the investigation that will eventually begin, she "will pull a string to understand the functioning of an ant-infested system to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as "sick but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need his own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duceno notes for his part that "the officers stole hundreds of millions of dollars" but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but did not engage in fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign funding in Quebec is 70 per cent, he jokes: "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec is proposing to limit donations to 100 dollars to the parties, but it says that this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go down; we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducino calls on those who laugh to look in their own yard ...
"SJ is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've reached an extraordinary scale at the SPM.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual conscience, but it may also be explained by the new dimension of the FGM.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, things happen very quickly.
But I don't crawl.
From the beginning, at the NIF prep center in Clerfontaine until I arrived in St. Etienne, I always stepped forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition set up by Carlo Anchelotti...
Filling this summer is not new to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be up and down.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my positioning.
He's helped by deputies like Claude MacElele, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotti is the master of the situation?
Sure.
Anchelotti's got all the technical staff to respect.
Today in the First League, he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
That's when I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the First League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we have been well qualified in one eighth of the finals.
What's the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
Everything can be from now on.
We can say our word face-to-face with very good European teams.
We first want to end up first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take back the game in one eighth of the finals.
Will SCW be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for it...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions in the long term.
That's not true today.
Financially, SCW has the means to make this project real.
Would not take the title in the First League, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything we needed to get to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are for championship.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the race for title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are expecting too much from the SCW?
It's okay that we're expected to do a lot, given how much investment we've had and what players we've got.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're home winning 4-0 against Troy and we're still found to be critical, of course, it's a little upsetting.
We ask ourselves what people want us to do first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to inject a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet today's challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't been able to go through one eighth of the finals in two seasons, even though they've spent a lot of money too!
Given the amounts invested, we've been representing you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for France's championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who weren't at their height last season, were "woken" by this new SPM.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won as a result.
SPM seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovich's exploits.
So what if they say there's some kind of "Evil Dependence"?
That only means that Ibrahimović is very successful and that he has a lot of heads.
He came for this and he proves he's the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the band, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French team?
How disappointing.
I was eager to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from wasting some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I got out stronger.
Today, I'm able to play a good selection match.
That's what I've been hoping for since I got baptized at the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine and must now behave exemplaryly.
What do you think of Didier Deschama's first months at the head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He's got good positions in the selection team for the World Cup.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he's inspired to win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blue to Brazil.
A good, well-deserved tie (one-one), pulled out on October 16th in Spain, is that a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in itself.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no matches like this in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current exchange of money based on centrifugal banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with processing fees.
Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent exchange protocol that allows for the exchange of files between participants at the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoin for donations or for payment.
Bitcoin, peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its report on virtual currency published in October, was interested in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competitive with the dollar or the euro" and "like ordinary currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used to promote video games that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook's social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the deal.
Because of the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the Bitcoin used in the transaction do exist in a public account book distributed throughout the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in the book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers that, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
This is a file hash phase, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, a short and unique one.
The computers "berut" new transaction and add a number to it before "hash" all together.
The aim is to find a number that gives a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus irrevocably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, a user would want to pay twice in less than 10 minutes with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoons.
In order to avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one stomillion, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The network's life has already survived the ups and downs.
Bitcoin's services were attacked, and the Bitcoin were stolen from reserves.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," assured Pierre Nuaza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this deficiency.
Large players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as WordPress, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel analysed the account book and found that almost 80% of the Bitcoin were not in circulation.
"Gigant sales" was announced in November.
"Sixty thousand dollars have been exchanged," happy to see John Holmquist working for Coinabul, who converts bitcains into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, the other author of the currency allowance, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is sufficient simply to provide an address that can be photographed and identified by a phone, as Pierre Nuaza clarifies, assuring him that he has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"For a while before Bitcoin is established, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, intends, by the way, to review the various risks that are now considered to be heightened if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have withdrawn from their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them by the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, wounded and maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer exist as soon as the West behaves more sensitively.
The departure of French troops from Nijrab base, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credit, proceeded smoothly.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, and the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between the various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a sort of release, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they are outnumbered by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahidin, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women subordinate.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers taking over state land to sell them for construction to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge US subcontracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I hear in the countryside, want a government that isn't a thief.
Many young people want to leave as those who have achieved American generosity leave: capital flight is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled by both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that watch everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities who will command her, will they be considered legitimate?
The old commanders in the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial friendships that are not subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to a certain extent, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to make it a central State with strong presidential power by removing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s and even earlier, depended on foreign aid.
Industry has not been put on its feet, no dams are functioning, and no irrigation system has been repaired.
All imported; nothing produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were only there to take possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transportation to export through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the copper field of Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a great extent, re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: girls ' lycée, boys ' lycée, French language faculty at university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds and fulfil the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at rehabilitating agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labour, helped to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we keep to our memory by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, what farmers want, as they told me, requires a little non-military support that is well controlled and direct to them.
Heavy births to the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Morsi's new risky move.
While Egypt was more divided than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gave it extraordinary powers, it had decided to play a va-bank.
By surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
Soon two years later, Egypt had relied on a preliminary text that had been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion," continuing "to violate the word" and "to violate the law."
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that compels the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, the article by article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview with American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is similar to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: either you vote for my text or I reserve extraordinary powers, which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals didn't respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 persons, the alternate participants, were hurriedly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members felt that the Constituent Assembly's watch was wrong.
The text, which had yet to be voted on yesterday, consisted of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2, ultimately, remained the same article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of the sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace the "principles" with the "rules," which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Persemere," answers liberals, who only see it as a PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, as "the decision makers are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of theocracy."
Many liberals are also disturbed by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the present one.
"There is currently no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain in civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulemas, but university students, some of whom have studied in the French system," calms Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits that "there may be ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used in it are taken from religious language.
This applies in particular to the "fiks."
In the future, the question may arise as to whether civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have declined significantly compared to the old regime.
Another controversial point is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will take place not in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Nor would the trial of civilians before military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter have also expressed concern about a text that they consider to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy was preserved and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speak of the protection of a woman anymore, highlights Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive development was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will go out on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Earth's Pup and the sea from the ground.
The promised earth brings together the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the primordialness of nature.
AIF identified five of the most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Worship Holy Places
It is worth a visit to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace befalls anyone who enters this "bought".
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ' wonders: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here, Jesus appeared before his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all, it is the holy place in Jerusalem.
The believers here are on the path of Scorby or Jesus ' Godfatherly Way (in Latin - Via Dolorose).
It begins at the Fortress of Antony - Pretorum - where there was a trial, and leads to the Temple of the Tomb of the Lord on Mount Golgophe - the site of Crucifixion, the Stone of Salutation, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was raised from which a cross was made to crucify Jesus.
Jerusalem also has the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of Plac, left of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave here letters of desire that are then fulfilled.
Make a Vertical Travel
The ruins of Massad's fortress were left from the secret refuge of the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on the shrivelling rocks in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above ocean level.
Only those who are interested in climbing can get to them.
The rest of us on this historic peak are being delivered by a roped road lift.
And in the north of the country, at 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort, Hermon, which has a huge influx of tourists during the winter months.
A shuttle bus arrives from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski routes is 45 km.
According to an old tradition, pagan gods were living on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go on one trip to everyone.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition features extensively the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renouar, Cezanne, Cissley, Matissa, Modigliani, Chagala and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Museum, which is a number of halls of old Turkish baths with mules of visitors and bankers of the time.
In Caisaria, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum where you can look at the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There's no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free, and donations are categorically rejected.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Wash in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children ' s memorial, was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who had been destroyed in concentration camps and gas cells.
You walk into it, you end up in absolute darkness.
The stars are flickering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Get well.
Israel ' s three main resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphins, and oceanariums.
Interestingly, even in the winter months, the Red Sea bathes because the temperature of the water does not fall below 21 degrees of heat and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is still warmer, and it's bathing all year round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world at the lowest point of the planet - 417 meters below the sea level.
The lazur water in it is a blubber that is easily contained in the water and can't even swim at all.
The landscapes around here are unbelievably beautiful.
They're coming here to get treatment with salt water - raps and healing dirt - and to cure health in dermatitis, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to clean up their nerves.
Touch the Secrets of the Ancients
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
The famous Sea Way, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia, passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists are very fond of wandering through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street with your own sign, Fortune will be nice.
You can find newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even from other countries in a photo shoot in Yaffo.
And in Caesar's city, King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre, " take ' the fortress of the crusaders.
During the Roman period, Keisaria was the main city of Judah and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontia Pilate.
A carefully restored theatre is now being used for evening concerts and opera performances.
To the tourist for the record.
When you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30 percent of the population speak Russian.
It is better to charge money for a trip in dollars rather than euros, which are easily exchanged for shekels (now US$ 1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a fast tram, and Haifa has the only subway line in the country consisting of six stations linking the Lower City to the Upper City.
Basically, it's an underground furiculer.
All forms of urban transport cost 6 shekels, which can be driven with transplants for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is that the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation stop working.
And on Sunday morning, the work week starts.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes, which combine milk with meat.
It offers a large selection of ovine and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauce, phalalel balls, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that go around on their own.
Even on the roofs of parked cars, you can see them sleeping tonight.
Murlykies love people's places and don't give up on treats.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, would cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus, insurance is $15 a day.
It'll cost 15 shekels a day to rent a bicycle.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
The citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine came most to travel and to rest.
From January to October 2012, 118,800 Ukrainian tourists were on Earth, an increase of 51 per cent over 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" to Moscow will lead to migrants buying money into the language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that the law on compulsory language testing will provide, fraudsters trading "lip" certificates have already appeared in the country.
In Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities, 13 million gastarbyters arrive every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind in their homeland.
As of 1 December, a law had entered into force, according to which every migrant worker would be required to take the Russian language test.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing and utilities, welfare and retail trade.
In time, however, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors, as promised by the FMS.
At the same time, it will be necessary to surrender not only the language but also the Russian history and the basis of the legislation.
Language skills will have to be confirmed for both acquisition and renewal of work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the national language.
Nor are people subject to the law who obtained certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, Destiny and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will be run under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGU, the PSPG and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres had already opened in Russia.
Both the deputies of the State Duma and the FMC supported the testing initiative.
Before the law came into force, human rights defenders asked the press many times, what would that actually do?
What will change the need to know the language for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service's response will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery."
Very many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explaining Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federation office in Tajikistan.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve the problems of foreign workers by 90 per cent.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, education, language or medical examination.
Without an understanding of the language - I'm sure Sebelev - a future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who, under the guise of aid, will put him in a creepy, tight bark, where he and dozens of his likes will suffer for months without food or documentation, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In their home country, they are promised one, and upon their arrival they are deceived, taken passports, and not paid the wages promised," confirmed by the head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of the MTP of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear, you monster!
However, so far, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to Russia for work have recognized that they do not only know the language of the country to which they aspire, but also have difficulty writing on their own.
Of course, it's not so much their fault as their trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a meaningful primary education.
Because their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress them properly, dress them up and put them in school.
When they reach adolescence, they go to work as soon as they can.
It's hard if you don't know the language, they're gonna admit it.
"Feeling humiliated and subjugated."
There is, however, one important point regarding the language law for human rights defenders.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastarbaiters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or I'm not allowed to enter."
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12,000 and 16,000 rubles.
And then you can make fake registration fast, and it's only 1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists Umed Khushkadamov, a Tajik citizen.
♪ Come on, come on, buy painting ♪
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it became clear that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several "lip" language test certificates have already been seized by FMS staff.
Counterfeited papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not take them for granted: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests paid 7,000 rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of official testing: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "crumbs" cannot be bought simply, the authorities and human rights defenders all agree.
For the time being, the authorities can promise the Hastarbaitetrams, who have failed to pass the first test, time for basic language courses.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not handle the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposes to strengthen the law on the possession of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: to press shots at weddings without casualties, and to the massacre carried out by the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age at which a gun licence can be obtained from 18 to 21 years of age.
Idea was supported by Irina Yarovai, head of the Thought Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, and promised that the Arms Act would be amended in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by twisting the gaeks.
There is an open letter on the web, which - representatives of various community-based small arms organizations - calls for a "thinkless tightening" to be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimally reported to the BBC Russian Service by forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms registered with internal affairs agencies were committed in the first six months of 2012, compared with 1,168,000 in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil-arms legislation does not place the offender in the black market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black arms market is being replenished through several channels.
The five main channels are described by retired colonel Victor Baranets, who has served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
A screen shot of a site that takes orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military trail," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were being dragged by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next kind of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from the security forces.
The Baranian explains that this includes both those taken from police stores and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal guns are being sold from military stores.
Many military warehouses have often been bombed.
"There's a proven theory that part of the arson was deliberately made to cover the gap," says the ex-military.
According to Barantz, arms manufacturers are doing their part.
"There are now private weapons factories that fail to compete in the international market and throw weapons out of the floor into the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are especially many guns and machine guns coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's production there, sometimes handicraft, and there's a mafia that organized the stream," explains the former military.
Where's the gun coming from?
The experts considered the approximate share of each source of illicit arms transfers to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
The experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminology literature and the open data of the portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons are written by researchers, coming from the army and the security agencies.
Half of all weapons in the black market have been found "by officials whose work is related to weapons" in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases are stolen during the weapons production phase, and 5 per cent are from "black archaeology."
The consultant seller of one of the arms stores, who asked me not to give his name, assures me that the weapons found by the black diggers have not been bought for a long time - too old.
Most of the time, as he says, the new party is being followed by salesmen to the military warehouse.
A person buys a unit through a dispatcher, like a TT gun.
He's being discharged, passed through the fence.
"He's moving her into town and here he sells 900 euros per thing with two stores," he says.
"The truth is, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a crime-solvability plan is on fire, they're running a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"It's like a luxury store."
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I've been looking at websites, blogs, until a comrade responded, who offered to come to the "Begoya" platform, where there's gonna be a man taking me to the corner where we're gonna trade.
I only learned the value of the gun there.
Military columnist Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need someone I know who has a way out, says the consulting salesman.
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that my daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of castets right now through a man I'm sure of.
He only delivers them to me, too, because he knows I'm not gonna turn him in.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The patterns, he says, have not changed.
He was given an album with pictures of "anything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, don't just buy. We're going to the woods with the salesman.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced that a gun hits well, we start trading," the expert describes the procedure.
The store is on the couch.
Web searchers are posted on Vkontakte's websites and groups, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
You don't need documents or face-to-face meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they put it in a commercial hat on "Bought a gun or a machine gun."
It is open to users to leave their requests and ask questions.
They sell it to minors?
"No license of course," asked the user Ivan (orphography retained).
"T. Moscow's Cup" - concisely formulates the Fedorenkov's request.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of front sites and wants to buy combat weapons with a shovel.

I've heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
"In response, a photograph and instruction are sent, where weapons are hidden," says the press secretary of the voluntary organization Right to Weapons, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the website can be left unarmed and put in jail.

100-dollar Makarov.
Experts estimated that between $100 and $900 could be spent on the purchase of illegal small arms.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Weapons, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It's gonna take a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage facilities by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to official statistics, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent from January to October 2011, to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported thefts and extortions of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the U.S., fast food workers and supermarkets strike.
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through the McDonald's Cathedral.
In recent days, America has witnessed a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendies and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth berm, or if it's going to exhale in the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages paid to ordinary Walmart workers and the fast food system, the purpose of protesters is to establish trade union organizations.
This sector of the economy has so far been largely excluded by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stocks began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday," when America was hit by a cheap sale orgy, which captured millions of traditionalists and was sometimes accompanied by fights.
On that day, some Walmart workers, who employed 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists at the corporation's stores, whose goods were counted on people of modest and medium means.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The average cost of products in his shops is 8% to 27% less than in large supermarkets.
So many of Walmart's low-paid workers are only working at their own place.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods to the cheap, partly because he pays his employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of trucks or manual scanners.
The Black Friday shareholders demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who gets $9.5 an hour, that wasn't enough, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on salary right now.
If Walmart puts the entire salary increase on the buyer's shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They're gonna spend $12.39 more in a year than they are now.
Walmart's supporters note quite well that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to corporations.
"Black Friday" continued in her stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of almost 100 million transactions were made by its cashiers on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with Huffington Post's left-hand website that the jobs had left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a "simple piaar trick" by the union that organized it.
Free Cashier!
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart department stores (they are not welcome in this progressive city and therefore are not here yet), but by McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of portions, and after that, he doesn't even give you sick leave or pay you to do a fair job!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants increase it over time, but slightly, and average their regular workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one makes less money in this expensive town.
How can you exist in New York with that kind of money? It's incredible to me.
At one point, the McDonalds were used by almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their counters after school while living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I'm constantly facing interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has a comment that says it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of rapid feeding.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this from happening and punishing trade union activists with pickpockets and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But the union's rapid feeding is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
Dissenting
Noisy protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The campaign culminated in a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democrats, including a member of the council of Jumain Williams who said: "Macdonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick ones or pay you to do your fair work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats supported the demonstrators, such as Bill De Blasio's candidate for mayor, who said that "we must join in supporting fast food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest act of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast food workers, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will produce a mass movement flame.
♪ As long as you're cheating the brain ♪
A popular theme among modern technology fans has recently been adopted mainly through the prism of special points.
First at its annual conference in the summer, Google showed the current model, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for the patent.
However, a conversation with the head of an interactive 3D technology group at Cambridge's Microsoft Laboratory, Sharam Izadi, shows that for a company's scientists, glasses are a step ahead.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell me, in general, what is your research group doing?
- We're working on a man's interaction with cars, but we're trying to spread the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as humanity is stuck in the pixel phase on a flat screen, sometimes finger-pointing.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and anticipate a fundamental change in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everyone is interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Even though Kinect has moved to the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change that, working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do so, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a question of privacy, because you don't always want to let others know about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone's in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not frivolous ones, but such stingy ones, short ones.
The gestures were not taken by a camera of the device, but by a hand bracelet that captured the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the watch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, like a gesture+votes.
- How's that?
- Like how do you ask me to give you this soda can?
You're gonna say it and you're gonna show it at the same time.
- I usually just say.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you're trying to get users to adapt to what a car can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think we're gonna have to work for the most part in the near future to develop new types of sensors that will make it possible to define human responses more accurately.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a pretty good resolution in depth, it's very important.
Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your concerns about modern cameras?
Is there a lack of clearance, depth or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that we can build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to have a megapixel of eight at a speed of 1,000 k/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, adding work to algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Also very important is speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the present 30 k/s is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Steven Betices of our Radmond Laboratory has made a touch sensor with controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I'd really use the equivalent of this device in my work, but I don't need to touch it, so I don't need more frames per second.
- Don't you need more cameras?
Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is a receiver of a reflected signal.
And now the third camera is actually a common sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogy, play with the curvature of the cameras, and see how that helps in a three-dimensional position determination.
As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think from the point of view of the day-to-day use of technology, the reality of glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, it's not easy to walk around holding a smartphone in your arms all the time, but here's what I'm thinking: the coolest option would be a "overlapping" added reality, where, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from points to smartphones, projection displays and everything else.
The glasses are a very personal device, and that's their strength (the private things only you see), and at the same time the weakness - the added reality based on the glasses will prevent you from working on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's say for a minute that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your group's answers to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactical sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second arm as a substrate for the image.
She's a great hit recorder!
But there are technologies that are really designed to give these "cartoons in the air" the touchiness - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located - gives a sense, but so far it's very weak - as if you've been blown to the pillows.
There are wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - a promising direction as well.
- Did you try to fool your brain?
To make him think that he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There's another challenge that's gonna be fighting for a long time -- how to get a person physically in a very limited space to believe that it's going on open, almost infinitely -- working on the concepts of runways (other than clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as it takes the average brain to cheat, it's still a lot of work for years.
That's what makes work on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher - many things in a completely embryonic state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde," which focuses on the citizens who are in the front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list already includes prominent figures from the art scene of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, without all the Russians being known.
The new hero of "Rosbalta" is an epathetic artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who meets at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, and at fashion parties and vernisages.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they're displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers who create new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man in the Petersburg vanguard of the late '80s - early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, showing up on the streets, smiling at the citizens, making everyone feel better.
Recently, he took up the charm and became a Petersburg charmer, as he was ripe for this complex role in all his goddess existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I've chosen red as a modeler for view and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker, and society.
Although everything in society is a little gray, it causes aggression and an incitement to unkindness.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the DK Nevsky where my work was displayed.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and the new, free type of me didn't understand.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gason thickness that led to the Pushkin 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, clothes, music, all kinds of genres, except words.
And it all came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to be at the centre of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I took over the territory at Pushkin 10, and there was a music art club, a bohemian club, a house of the Peterburg Bohemia, until it was repaired.
Many were born there: the Nomas, Tequila Jazz, I remember Schnura being brought with the Van Gogh's ear project.
Shnur and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in tight tights, among them the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, she became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs until the time of the Cali-Livian era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and education from us.
Gallery D 137, Club Griboeds are the rebounds of Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars left.
I'm a hero of last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the award was "The People of Our City."
The designer of the year was named me, and I'm finished.
In new times, under old rules, it's uncomfortable to work, I'm a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular these days, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable manner.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're very relevant and acute.
I'm gonna have a show, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an off-time category.
I used to be social, being like this right now is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything is blurring, tragedy is being removed.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by making a totalitarian change of order.
Now they're meeting on their clothes, looking at external mechanics, not the inside man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by dressing.
And recently, we saw you as a city charmer.
Who I don't want to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful.
- Now commercial art has to be neat, tactical, sweet.
Cultures are being disintegrated.
People used to fall into packs, Goddess loved one thing, beat the other.
Everybody's in a micro community right now, and it's gonna be hard for everyone to like right now.
I'm not a hundred dollar piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now we need to think about who's gonna like it.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- There's a few thousand of them coming to Stas Mikhaylov!
- He gets dumped, the sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and in the end, less management, less money, more shit.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to screw up what I've gained.
When I was young, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them on a wall next to Falc and Larion hanged.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say it's a spiritual culture, a consumption culture.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I was a man of yesterday's culture, raised by the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money to paint paintings.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: an official from culture.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
Under the right kings, things weren't like that, kings, maybe they didn't understand much about culture, but they knew they had to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow now.
We've got people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
There's a good taste now.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by what they honestly say, that not all modern art we accept, are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And it's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tone.
We need to do the fashionable art we did at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg
To be born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthmen on board are on their way to search for a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, is there a central question as to how to continue our lineage under conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," according to Vladimir Surdin, Senior Fellow at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomy Institute (GAIS).
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Space reproduction has begun to be approached with flora.
Half a century ago, they experimented on plants.
Four generations of orbital peas were no different from their Earthlike varieties.
Then, the orbiting of insects, tiny fruit flies, drosophile.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo developed under conditions of weightlessness.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird on the way out.
And then there's the problem.
"The problem of finding a support for this baby must stand on its feet and start moving," explains the director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of Rán Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding a foothold, the chicks blew out randomly.
And ten hours later, the newborns had a complete instinct atrophy.
The birds didn't react to the light or the sound.
And the trouble there was that after four days, they just died.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, and then we refused because it's impossible to work with them," notes Vladimir Sychov's failure to experiment with the chicks in space.
With the animals, the last biological minicog flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will have only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with fruit.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was on biosatellites, but again, it's a single experiment, and this research needs to be done," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had a progeny.
But it is not yet possible to address the problem of breeding directly in space.
It's an inexcusable task.
Animals, losing their traditional habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our tea has flown away, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive a space flight.
Will she be able to have a baby after that flight?
"No one answered that question," says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the missile and space industry.
In June 1964, just one year after the space flight, Valentina Tereshkova's first cosmonaut woman gave birth to a daughter.
Andrian Nikolaev's child's father was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana, a second cosmonaut, had a son who was twice in orbit and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, there are a few astronauts who have gone through a long flight, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if it's bigger, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia, Valery Polakov.
Yet mankind needs to find new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CDC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory pre-flight phase.
Here, under conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts are working in outer space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults the water, though comfortable, is alien, then for infants, it is a natural element.
It's like little ichthyandras confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that the baby is in mom's fertilized fluid for about nine months, and it's easier to get used to the water later.
In principle, it's logical because it's only two weeks from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing.
"It's very little to forget something," says the pearfly instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if weightlessness is more natural for a child born, gravity and gravity are necessary for a woman.
Very quickly, in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, and the ability to push the fruit fall.
All right, let's just put it down by relying on the birth stimulators.
You can, of course, go to delivery in a special cell, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks the non-trivial questions of Valerie Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of earth's attraction, the body will not form a skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special handling costume for training.
He's just gonna be deprived of what he's gonna need.
"And this experiment that you and I are going to do by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead us to bring to the Earth a disabled, completely disadapted human being," anticipates the head of the Bioethics Committee of IMP RAN Igor Pest.
So far, the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality when the Earthmen on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief Audit Officer: The Swartz system audit failed because of political fault.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic had good controls and, despite the existence of quality legislation, was lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for AktuálnÇ.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented on Kala's current situation.
Such opinions are provided by the joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of bad practice, Peter Nehtze's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is described.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the PDJ (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this banned or allowed?
"The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits anything, neither the Prime Minister can resist the work of the institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
This is a parallel test that we started, probably two years ago.
To put it simply, European law states how public procurement should proceed, followed by national legislation and then also practical application.
All the information has been collected and, even if it has not yet been completed, interesting differences have been found - to put it simply, we may have a "just and correct" legislation, but in practice we have some parameters of German descent.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How does this project actually help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, to reduce and to improve restrictions, because it does not produce positive results.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're gonna achieve this by reducing our orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not decrease.
You are referring to domestic problems with the practical application of public procurement legislation.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU (the Audit and Control Office) or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, there is the Bundesrechnungshof as our CRU, which is organized according to our principle, and there is also a panel that works in a slightly different way, but basically both institutions operate in the same way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal provinces - in this system they are somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only run federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As far as local legislation is concerned, it's easier than us?
Actually, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some ways Germany can be taken as a model, but it can't definitely be said that it's better at everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how has your institution been affected by the amendments to the Public Procurement Act?
Given that the legal effect of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been reflected in our verification work.
As we monitor the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We only take this into account in the process of preparing future audits - we have started using our new tool of "detection of risk of incoherence," through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts, and we have analysed them, which, of course, will manifest these changes because of changes in restrictions, changes in the terms of certain types of tenders, and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law would benefit or add to the burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope that will prove it.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "strengthed" and will not be respected.
Under previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes with the regional council) in that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in such a way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister announced that the FDW would not bother entrepreneurs with the tests of the so-called Schwartz system.
Is the Schwartz System prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibited anything, the Prime Minister could not oppose the work of bodies that were required to verify and enforce obligations.
You could say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but we can't say we're gonna pretend nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains fairly strict rules, as and what should be formally conducted, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passable, but in some places with more caution.
Carlovar Krai
This morning, in the Carlovar region, roads were passing through, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but should warm a little during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only the lowlands contain a small layer.
However, on the riddles of the Roast Mountains lies about 30 centimetres of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that the areas were less visible due to fog.
The R6 Express Highway and first-class roads in the region are now open without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be indecent and slippery.
All second and third-grade roads, including mountain tracks, are also accessible.
But some of them still contain the remains of frozen snow and areas of frozen snow.
Especially attention should be paid to the roads on the high places.
Pardubice and Kraloveddeck edge
The Czech Highway Administration reports on its Internet pages that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are at risk of famine, and that mountain roads and roads on the highlands may contain a heavy layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a holode that can be formed especially on the highlands of the Pardubice edge.
Hololed can be near Lanshkrown, Usti nad Orlici, Polícki, Sweetawi or Visoke Mito, especially on second and third-class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads at Sweetawi are treated with chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of Krkonoshe and the Orlician Mountains.
It is located on roads on the hills in the Rihnova nad Knezhnow and Trutnova regions.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today, there is a variable cloud without rainfall.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plsen Krai
The roads in the Pilsen Province are passing through this morning, but the places need to be careful and adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, some locations may be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog in their seats, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost unrestricted, but the control roads recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have dry and depressing surfaces.
In southern Plzni and Tahove, there may be incorrigible areas.
The second and third class roads are wet, and there is also a warning about the possibility of slippery sections.
Drivers must be careful, especially on underutilized roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers on the mountain of Olomouc should take into account the snow on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Czervenogore saddle and on the road towards Videlsk Krchij.
During the night, snow forced road workers to enter the street, according to the traffic control, it was about three inches of snow in Shumperka.
In other areas, the edges of the road are generally unrestricted.
"On the heights of Schumperk lies the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenik should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Czervenogore saddle," CHAN (Czech News Agency) reported today, the Sumperk Road Manager.
During the night, their colleagues from Yesenik went to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on the hills after the chemicals were treated remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are unrestricted, but in Sternburke drivers must be careful on forest areas where humidity is still present.
Устекцке рей, Либеректский рей
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still a few difficult places to walk.
According to the police database, in addition to several places with holoded or snowfall, a mountain road has been closed from Telnica in Klinice in Usteck Krai.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so there is snow and ice on the roads, and in the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle East, there is no problem, the roads are mostly dry.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of a holode in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for his formation at night - raining and snowing all day, the sky became clear at night and frost began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highway and I/13 on the border between Usteck and Liberetsk.
Owing to the curved branches of trees on the road itself under the snow, they were forced to close the road at Telnica on the Kninitz.
At concerts, we want to build up positive energy.
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans get so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we're always joking about this and we're saying that we're the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give an absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you elaborate on this for the readers?
This is a national fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of Maya's calendar, which ended on December 21, at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20th, at 9:00 p.m., three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava are running in parallel.
They will end, frankly, at a time when the May calendar will be completed on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, which has a clock belt 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who thought of that idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to build up enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state of the world that we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which can be bought at www.e-tap.cz and thus be supported.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World's Aborted."
Will the already-loved YouTube audience have an anthem at these Beneficent concerts?
Of course, at the end of the day, if it works out and the world doesn't end.
He'll be sung by all the artists at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be broadcast live on Czech television at the same time.
The words to this song wrote and played Jesus' role in the video of Tomas Ganak, also participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural actors, as we hold many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to get them actively involved in these projects.
It turns out that a lot of people like to work with us, they're interested.
What will be the proceeds of the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for a barrier-free education centre, STUDEO, for the sixth year, we've been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlicca Institute.
Teachers regularly attend schools at the Edlicki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them that opportunity.
As part of the additional construction project of the Edlicki Institute, a separate building will emerge in the future, to which we will move with the project.
There will be several music groups and singers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to design a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi will be featured in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grandical activities" in the future?
In May, we'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, and here, of course, we'll prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd love to have a show at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
With regard to overseas, you have serious plans, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
The Czech airline ČSA and the British airline British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, which has surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Travel abroad allows you to compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, etc.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, Russia has seen that it is still at the basic level in the east.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and there's still an independent movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the middle of the city.
Also, there's no such thing as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own on the streets, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, and that's a little bit ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrierless is one thing, but at a time when there are famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us, then things will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but we'll be back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlicki Institute as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I play saxophones, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our host Ladya Angelovich says, it's a little out of control (laughs).
Isn't popular only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
True, it helped us to start joining the famous singers and actively working on the group's propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that a job that no one can evaluate is essentially as if there is no one.
Thanks to European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so forth.
Was it so good for you to turn The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that mimic one another.
It's logical, everything's taken with caution, and it's been going on for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, pity, is natural...
But that pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned individuals that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's not just for them, it's for society as a whole.
What is the matter with you, that you are a steadfast leader, as many of you consider you to be successful?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and maintain some discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, to study classes, and to spend a lot of time on the road, they lose their enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
He is currently a member of The Tap Tap Group of 20.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of will, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda Club and in Ostrava at the Plynojem centre, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telebridge at the time of performance of the song "The Tap Tap" "The End of the World is Lifted."
The aim of the project is to raise funding of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlicca Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner for children under 12 years of age, free of charge, and can be bought in advance at Bohemiatiquet.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has actively participated in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
But Poland began the way to outer space a long time ago.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were on space flights, but this was not always understood.
I will recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who, on 6 December 1933, presented to the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Space."
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Hadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and André Luis Hirsch Prize in France for "Introducing Space."
Dr. Jan Hadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Hadomsky became a world-renowned space promoter, and his contribution was appreciated, inter alia, by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway drone with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the draft.
It is not even clear whether a missile should have been used to disperse or to brake the trolley.
Information about this dream is only known from the press of that era.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section in cooperation with Professors Meichekawa Wolfke and Gustav Mojitski.
The remaining material shows that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket proposed by engineer Rogozinski appeared in a specialized press, and the following year the work of the author's "Aerial Torpedo and Aerial Bomb Missile" was released.
Both projects were developed for the military use of missile engines.
Prior to the war, all military missile projects were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended with the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on space appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of "Problems," which publishes four large articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a space society.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and has already become a valid member of PAA in the autumn.
And next year, the first president of PAA, Kazimez Zarankewicz (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful Meteorological Missile RM (Rakieta Meteologiczna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of crossing the distance of 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long and weighs less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested on the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighs about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to carry out actual scientific work: the RM-34 missile could have passed 14.5 kilometres, and its mission was to monitor the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first RM-type missiles were inherited by the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked as Meteor 1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which varied in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C 0.62L.
All three types had a maximum range of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a launch weight of 380 kg, was capable of delivering a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Mention should also be made of Poland ' s accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR national committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
The ruling generated a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
A significant difference in labour costs (wages) creates price stress.
By this term, one must understand a state where a producer, by delivering a cheap commodity, tries to resist economic competition by "stripping" the value of a competitor to take a large part of the market and thereby increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move production abroad or purchase cheap abroad or disappear, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
As private capital bears no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, there is an increase in the inevitable social expenditure of the State.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social losses they cause in pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Ceremonious private capital practices create, at the level of individual economies, situations where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own people arbitrary private capital despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the legislation in force.
The aim is to make their people economically subject to the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This operates as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, while at the same time serving as a tool to reduce workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty levels are rising, but the gap between the poor and the rich is increasing.
There has been a public distribution of products to the poor in the FRG for several years, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labour.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the improvement of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are persistent cases in which employed persons receive such wages that the State must pay them extra to ensure that they receive a subsistence level.
This scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional workers in the Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on poor wages on the backs of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come into the country.
However, where would he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for a share of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are nauseatingly arguing that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not intervene in the economy by its managers.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the whole state, is operating for its own selfish purposes?
The clear answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of almost all-powerful and omnipotent lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have a desperate situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where virtually everything deserves punishment but is not a crime.
In the FRG, the situation is that government ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the drafting of legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
Then these bills are passed by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial and power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that a liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly emerging in a situation like that described by Appian in the Roman Empire's Crisis in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The State has long been broken up, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
The bribes, the illegal receipt of favors with stones and swords.
Gratitude and corruption flourished without prohibition, and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ...right people didn't run for power at all, after all, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months. ..." Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-power and the need to choose an energetic man. " ...Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar who finally changed democracy to self-Power.
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is by its very nature no longer intended for public use.
The present outcome is no different from the past: the elitist ' s inexorable decline without any attempt at deeper reform.
So the cause of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, followed by a next round.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution was targeted political and social reforms that would strengthen the State ' s share of the economy, enhance the role of citizens in the governance of the State and reduce the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"There's no way out of this violence, and there's no way out." Sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of refrene is the words, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted war, they wouldn't have been" - the dying Gutel Schnaper, Meer Amschel Rothschild's wife.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many responses.
Some advocate Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence and that the Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that it is racist of the Israeli State, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurrent waves of killings, is the criminal and who, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and who did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension - counting on the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917 - on a small piece of Middle East land.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether there is someone behind their throne who has directed their actions towards pre-determined goals.
We must be allowed to live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting authority could not have occurred in a generation.
Among astronomically rich families, one is singled out that could be seen as the head of a sprute (I don't know if anyone's standing above them, but it's not ruled out) - the Rothschilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) had already bought in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their names to criminal actions in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadows, and which had always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or both.
They have large shares in almost all of the world's central banks, and against countries in which they have no share, they wage or prepare war (only seven countries before the invasion of Afghanistan, five after the invasion of Iraq, only four after the overthrow of Qadhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government has taken the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war, he began releasing his own (understanding government) money and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy started releasing his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (federal reserve system), was killed in 1963; deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue FED for initiating the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to a plan for three world wars, created by the great Mason of 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The aim of the first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial rule, especially in Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion (such numbers of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury and would not consume much resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and to finally seize absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds works is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of FED, which should have prevented a recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in launching the First World War by assassinating the habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the king's Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (already there was no need for war to destroy the king's Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austro-Hungary, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing enormous military reparations on Germany, which created a prelude to the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then only left to give the Germans a strong enough to denounce the perpetrators and propose simple solutions for Chief, to further create a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed played the role of the fifth column, in fuelling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judah with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration created a prelude for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes began with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II had broken out, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which the bankers had originally held him, or whether everything he had done had been planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps had created the prerequisites for the Jewish State to be recognized by the world community.
Israel was formally founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was declared to create a third-party hotbed of war.
If international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of fighting on the front line, now alongside the Arab or, more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into Israel's supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence if it begins with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish ordinary Israeli people from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers give people to vote exclusively for their own candidates.
Israel ' s current Prime Minister, Netanyahu Hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran ' s control over the Ormuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of the world ' s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also destroy the world economy.
What is the light of what David Rockefeller said in 1994 now: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order?"
The new world order in their conception is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have a brand on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
That's the wisdom: anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and this number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo: When there's nothing worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah, Mohammed Reza Pehlawi, who fled after the US Revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it could fundamentally undermine the credibility of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a prophetic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The prisoners ' diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations facilitated by the Algerian Government.
Their fate has given rise to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with Ronald Reagan's election.
The film cut by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small wins.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After difficult feathers, they finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to remove them from Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover story, according to which they were travelling on Canadian passports as members of a filming group who were looking for a place in the country to film a science-fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's "evacuation" expert invented called for Hollywood's cooperation.
For the legend to be credible, specialized magazines would write about the film's project, press conferences would be held, and a fictional manufacturing company would have a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
The Affleck movie is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political pilot, the so-called film-kinopus, the story of a good idea, the scam - an example could be a series of films about Ocean's friends.
The film constantly changes the mood - on the one hand, the documented scenes from Tehran (titres show landmark historical images of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there are no major differences).
On the other hand, eased Hollywood passages, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies -- the men in the suits are talking about the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck's made a great career restoration.
From a mocked actor, he became a respected director, and his game stopped being ridiculed.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and Triller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film not to be filmed in Boston's home town.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is related to the qualities that raised earlier film directed over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, and in the reconstruction of real events, the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressed by their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and uncertainty that arise when history changes suddenly.
Affleck and his colleagues have similar effects in the stage of fiction (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many trials in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply many exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's working pretty well with this few, sometimes he's thinking about something -- it doesn't go so elegant -- a scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and a runway chase looks pretty fancy.
The disadvantage of Argo is the dispersal of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are indeed very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
The Affleck film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing the production and the retro-styl that recreates the 70s.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a known sense, living history, as well as to testify to the exaggeration of ideas about all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop."
"We were encouraged by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said Pravo, the organizer of the poll, Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities that have already been nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance because, for insurance companies, they are objectively less at risk.
"The next incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place until the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The EU ' s controversial orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which is harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury gradients only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or the chicken cell size directive, which has significantly increased the cost of eggs this year.
There was also criticism of the de facto prohibition of the use of the term " butter butter " or the removal of classic bulbs from sales.
Qualitative bananas must be 14 centimetres long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic is now even under threat of flight in support of its banks).
The lobby's interests are such: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 cm and dared not be "anomal curvature."
In doing so, the European Commission justified the fact that it merely harmonized existing fragmented national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has reduced the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
The EU regulation last year, according to which selling balloons must be warned that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult supervision, may also be a candidate for the survey.
The EU has turned to American research, according to which balloons in the game are the potential cause of death of children by asphyxiation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are not allowed to blow into fairgrounds.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, but instead should say "BUREM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the coalition of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the above-mentioned absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the volume of food reserves in the territory of a member State.
The EU has established a maximum food stock that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the prescribed amounts of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a heavy fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of subsidies for applying for subsidies.
But these ideas came from Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in autumn 2004.
He argued that there had been a high crop of grain in the country and that, as a result of the so-called interventionist purchases, the State had had complete stocks that needed to be removed.
For being far away from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission responded to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidy grants were offered to villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be applied for from Brussels.
EU: Fancy orders are an exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, the EU ' s regulatory efforts, as well as the European Union ' s more efficient functioning and development, are, in the view of many experts, more deserving of recognition.
A serious problem, in the view of experts, is the receipt of EU grants for projects that do not even imply anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member States have achieved when discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, like other countries of the European Union, is emotional about fighting in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians, have retained the name "The Olomouc Cheese," but "Tuzemian rum," whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers were to be renamed "Tuzemak."
Only cane dystillates can be called rum, not sugar beet.
The official list of EU registered products, along with the world-renowned "feta" and "gorgondzola" cheeses, the German Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham, has already included, for example, carlovar suchars, the comb and Trzebon carp and the jateck ham.
The EU's trademark can also be proud of the pardubic carrot and the humps.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to run for president?
I don't think about becoming senator or president myself.
If everything in the country worked smoothly, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can't stand to watch the country turn around in the last 20 years, and thieves, people raise taxes, and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to figure out a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent man who doesn't belong to any party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I kept saying I'd go into a fight for the presidential castle depending on the results of the Senate election.
I later specified that if I were to be elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not to be a position, a position is a tool by which I can exercise my views.
That's why I need the most influence and the broadest powers.
But the problem is not only that we're a nation crying in our own bar or TV, but that we're willing to trample on anyone who tries to change things.
This is supplemented by the media, which vilify a person, and which confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I bribed journalists, or that I was Jiri Paroubek's advisor.
Let's get to your eyes.
The battle for the President's castle you started by talking about the pecuniary and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You have no such powers as president, and only the entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was lobbying as a citizen for the tour to become a free business, it was possible to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or on the right, they deliberately slay the obstacles, and it's holding citizens back.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential for receiving support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country and apply it without looking back at the dogmatics.
Do you think you're a more right-wing or left-wing person?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left man.
It doesn't matter to me, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
This isn't about someone on the right, it's about someone on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for the public whether the CHRM or the HPD will offer it, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or are being talked about by eminent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll only have slogans.
And with that, you're not gonna last much longer in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to exercise criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected President, there would have been no problem in organizing a live television programme calling on the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they don't, they'll have to tell me why they don't want to.
If there was a strong personality that would speak of abuse, there could be pressure on the political scene.
Take a direct presidential election - it was a tribute to public pressure.
I'm telling you directly that I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up for my beliefs and opinions.
I'm just starting out in politics, and I'm gonna try to get the majority's support for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; if that doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years and back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I won't do anything alone, so I've bypassed a number of famous people offering to run for Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, and he refused because of the heavy workload.
I also at least supported a leading investigation by a journalist, Jan Lorenzov, who discovered the fraud of light fuel products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unsatisfactory, but now I feel like I'm on the balance.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and the majority of those who chose the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate so that change would not be easy.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, such as direct elections for mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the integrity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for the president's campaign, only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what's your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a precinct in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork of about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and Schcod Superb for a million, and a few million more.
By the way, I had Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, was a halantine with women, and at the same time fought against vileness and lawlessness.
You drive aston Martin, you own $60 million worth of property, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million on the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program isn't as interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs are gonna actually cover my senatorial salary.
But with that money, I wouldn't be able to live, for example, to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run.
So you're gonna go on doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down on this?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would have wanted me to be a silverless man who would have kept the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From 200 to 400 thousand, which goes on.
And if I were president, I'd be out of business.
You will find a full interview in the Saturday issue of The Law.
Architects of MVRDV prove that real adventures are not just in the imagination - the example of Spakenissa and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photographs
"This building seems funny to me, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lizette Verhaig, on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I'm asking myself, why do we need another library today?
Everybody has Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
No one's voluntarily going to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Spakenisse, a small sleeping town under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with this unfortunate circumstance, several years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are shown in euro notes, in the form of painted iron concrete miniatur.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only way to beat the statistics: build a library here!
Wine Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Bureau MVRDV, master of bold column diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, took up the task with his usual insecurities and appeared at a competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and smile on his face.
And while the members of the jury were bewilderingly looking around and shaking their shoulders, the bold Maas folded a pyramid out of his original gift in size and concluded his defense speech with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
That's my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spakeniss, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this 30 million euro mountain grew.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, postage and several adjacent housing units and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wood Construction Competition.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which had never been able to offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest a milk factory, has become richer for one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, the first public cultural building in this town's history was created in Spakeniss.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression: Eldorado book under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because real architects and readers would prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed from all directions - light and easy to see, floors made of burned bricks and elegant street lights make a sense of public urban space without error.
The city environment is perfect.
Looks for the benches, dogs, and football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Ordinarily bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We've put a classic configuration of the space on the head and pulled the reading area out of the inside.
The inner space of a book mountain has been used with skill: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and technical facilities.
Black bookshelves, which serve as walls, parapets, and stairwells, are particularly welcome.
Their view, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and construction engineers are lost in guesses, what kind of unknown material is that?
"We sought to work with secondary materials," explains Yop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spakenisse community, as required by the standard.
And one day at a farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
Artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a root pad in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands for many years.
It's cheap and time-saving.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, then they can be thrown out.
For the library, this painting - for the first time in this volume - was compressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) becomes dark, uniform, solid material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
105 steps lead to the top.
Anyone who travels about 500 metres in length will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and tree ficus in the pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the right humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Trouborst.
The heat of the earth shall be used for heating and cooling.
Even though the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun will only enter for a short time.
Large glued wood farms, situated perpendicular to the glass facades, provide shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, an IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verhaig has also been here.
And a traditional Chinese medicine teacher, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spakenissa, which has long been missing."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to contribute a book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to be empty shelves, not yet fully staffed, with 70,000 books at the time.
The idea worked.
The shelves are all upstairs.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Wine Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she only serves for jewelry.
Thus, MVRDV was able to solve a royal problem called identity creation in a professional jargon.
Spakeniss wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the US-Europe liaison expert, in doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without speaking too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote to impose a no-fly zone.
NATO eventually implemented the proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, from the policy that the US was running to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of coherent common policies among Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are once again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they only feel their role, they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy France or Britain pursues.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a position beyond the control of the US or European partners in its national interest.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. on exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests differ significantly from those of other major States, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab world.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from taking important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even in the US.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the United States has clearly expressed its support for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European states?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a sufficient understanding of the European position in its heart.
But due to the local political situation, of course, the Government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that substantive differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all thrilled with Netanyahu's politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of a key partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, consistent European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and have to act instead on their own perspectives.
That's what they do to the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is understandable that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany still hard to lead?
Germany is not used to it yet, it is always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
It's not easy for the Germans to deal with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse situation than the US.
It must take into account a variety of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the US's influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, who is left behind?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, whether it's unpleasant or it's making you uncomfortable, that's life!

China's Trademark Security: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, also known as Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely official name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will remain protected until the original names have been sued.
But it is also unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to defend their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, specializing in trademark violations in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
It is enough for the simulators to add just a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci it's Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered a Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name, which also used the name of Ermenegildo Zegna's fashion house.
The Chinese are world champions of copying and violation of intellectual property rights.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch ' s cases were not the same, and on instructions from his trustees, he was opposed to China ' s enterprises being formally authorized by the Trademark Registration Office to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it the Minpia Ban, the mark passenger.
This word is associated with the Ban Dakuan.
That's what women who hunt rich men are called.
Chinese authorities plead not guilty
"It hurts business, it has to be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
"The brand is blurring, the unique position is lost, the image is very much damaged."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copiable products.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with sales of Euro15 billion a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult and expensive to obtain the removal of questionable entries in the trademark register.
The process can last up to nine years, with unclear outcomes.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed claims because after a long period of time the contested name became a "market reality."
If the plaintiff isn't lucky, he'll even have to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the manufacturer of Sany's construction machines, a company that had recently acquired a plant that produced the Putzmeister concretes.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo similar to the BMW; the process was successful and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste's fashioned product manufacturer lost in China to Hong Kong and Singapore's protagonists, who had a famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 owing to lack of staff and facilities.
But last year there was a "return from emergency to normal" in the working process.
Thus, the number of pending objections cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases had been closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending with the agency.
It's expensive to fight.
As is very common in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark security applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record that means that China, for the tenth consecutive time, has led a list of new registrations worldwide, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration is worth an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
The appeal is worth many times more, as the German family business of Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the band has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating their illegal production of counterfeit car parts.
However, the simulator has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission of its own, as the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wetzler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Office rejected the Munichese claim.
True, Freudenberg won in both of the following instances, but the opposing side is still fighting.
You need to be on your guard.
The matter is currently before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and nerves from us."
Domestic costs are unlikely to be accounted for, and the firm ' s records have even had to be reviewed for 100 years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "higher six-digit amount in euros" for a settlement.
"It's clear how much it costs us here," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if the simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but had nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
"There's a need to be vigilant," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions; rather, foreigners should " everything that is worth protecting in any way should also be registered in China," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the final act of his drama about the trademark, he will have to pay the opposite side license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Stinging, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi's chorus is being rehearsed - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of a relationship that has travelled more than 8,733 kilometres.
First it's sniffing: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's slippers pick up tactics on the parking floor and quickly find them.
One, two, three, four.
Only then will the voices of singers - alth, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly grow - come, charm, and follow each other.
And Fita Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pops out of his mattress shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Glee Club Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir, aged 23 to 69, from a human geneticist to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om" Obani is not an easy thing, and every choir's voice has its own text, in addition to a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-help
Unaids estimates that the United Nations AIDS programme has some 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
However, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeni, Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over as chief.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulu means a storyteller or a praiser.
This room doesn't speak fluently on a bow, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns songs in that other person's soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the voice of the German choir, is 873 miles [8733 km] away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HM virus.
In Esitzheni, a miniaturized disease throughout Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the foreskin of men, which has proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth dozen is not uncommon.
Ghor opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first Imbogni saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but also everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a man in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was the private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year - to send a child to school and to allow him to receive hot meals once a day.
But a year later, the Glee Club founded the Voices for Africa, which since then has provided almost professional care for AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper.
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viral STIs.
Pubic and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four of the five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often experience sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia infections, trichomonias, candidosis (grybok), gonorrhoea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
The incidence of chlamydia infection among young people is much higher than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also often have a human papilloma virus among our young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis incidence, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Communicable diseases can cause ulcer in genitals, complaints of urination, excretion, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and bubbles or gaskets.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain invisible.
How can you defend yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't offer 100% protection.
In fact, some of the causes of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Therefore, the experts recommend regular screening, especially in the case of frequent changes of sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote effects.
Chef, donations, and not least choir performance fees all over Germany make it possible to collect something.
"We've already sent everything to Esitzheni about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that orphans are well organized, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulu old women call it, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them received up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and ensured that children in uniform appeared in school on time every day.
Those who have no family members go to the shelter of Hanijsila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks that cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two hens and, together with the American Health Organization, PSI organized an HIV test for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's connected to sexuality."
It's quite unusual for a country where the King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this State-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the rapid spread of the IS virus in the past years.
But it is also on the hands of stray workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're barely used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, Ibmognie's choir travels every two or three years in southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, spirit, confidence and black consciousness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in the black language - such recognition not only brings good spirits and joy, but even happened to cause tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip is also always carried to Esitzheni, where singers visit their children.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on a map, it is more than known in the Etsulveni valley.
"Go to Esitgeni, there's light," said the people here.
And after a 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the scooping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here as well.
NASA opens ice on Mercury.
The Messinger probe found evidence that there was ice on planet Mercury.
Ice cover can be as thick as 20 meters.
NASA's space agency has proven the presence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messinger probe has found evidence that the planet's region, which is constantly in the shadows, is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimetres, perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collids with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the probe, Sean Solomon.
Mercury temperatures can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help to explain how water and other building elements of life have entered other parts of the solar system.
It is not obvious to Earth's inhabitants that probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows to endlessly given.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who appeals to Neptune around the sun, Ceres, by the new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars as blue dots, the harder to identify in a star circle the pink "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, called the W5 neuromanically, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This flooded heat of a dying star photographed the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut ring is made up of material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant nebula of Trifid, which is 5,400 light years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The NASA Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic delivery room.

One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble Telescope: the Watergate galaxy
Depending on the colour operator, images of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows a thousands of light years of trifid nebula in the constellation of the Arrows.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dronk, three-part), because the dark dust strips are divided into three parts of the hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed the harbinger of a space collision: 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the cores of two galaxy blending together and will inevitably collide.
It was the birth of the star of the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Someone who doesn't like technical cuts can call it the Southern Throne Wheel.
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of Iris' nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which has been removed for 1,400 light years, consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, photographed the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The great spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to Rosette's nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There's no dust in this glowing galaxy with a little black hole, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when most of the universe had hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei - even before Galileo Galileo began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been growing - and the space available to them is becoming deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here had a diameter of five metres.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Grand Telescopic Canarias has a giant interior device with a mirror of 10.4 metres in diameter alone.
South Africa's Great South African Telescope Mirror is segmented to lower costs.
However, it is about 11 metres in diameter.
Lack of low-cost design: the telescope is rigidly attached to a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Aberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It's a specialty: high-light-gauging ability.
It reaches the parameters of the world's largest telescopes, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror.
Through a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Mind (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
A view of the observatory of the European Astronomy Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's a very big telescope, which is exactly what it's called.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual tube.
A European "Very Large Telescope" is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should spread to an entire 42 m - and would be made of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaii volcano were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky using Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, Mauna Kea is about to have a new giant telescope with a 30-metre-diameter mirror.
You can look at the pictures here.
However, the most important species from space supply the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been providing pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system - especially those where life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The photograph shows the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search the light of the first stars and the galaxy for the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that there is ice on Mercury's southern pole.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messinger is moving closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Routine measurements for decades indicated that Mercury had ice on it.
Thanks to the Messinger probe launched in 2004, the first to revolve around Mercury, scientists are now confident.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the Bible's noble age.

Finding a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the Bible's noble age.
There's even a museum of longevity here.
Finding a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The journey through the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A booming minibus is sliding on a whirlwinded road, passing thick woods of hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright, you'd think you were in Schwartzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometres from here.
There are talyshes - one of the Caucasians, of whom little is known - except for what they speak finely in Farsi and Azerbaijani and are long-lived.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town is pissed off by the too heavy Soviet architecture, which is completely unharmonized with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiresome.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 kilometres, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea to come here, to the province, until it gets here.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest the tourists in Lerik.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayev.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen talyshes from these places over 100 years of age, and Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirali Myslumov, who is said to be 168 years old.
There are no birth certificates, however.
And given that the oldest person whose age is documented has reached the age of 122 years, the age of Muslumova is extremely questionable.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children and was said to have had a daughter at the age of 136.
So did Muslum's chab add a couple decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Schultz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
"A remarkable number of elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "a great number of very old people also live in Sardinia."
However, due to a lack of documentation, scientific proof of age was not possible because there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of heated oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerick often reach Bible age astoundingly.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long-terms here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide, Farid Mugimzadeh, explains this with special talysh genes.
On the contrary, the director of the Fatulaev Museum believes it's about nutrition.
Talishes love meat, bread, and dairy products most, many of them drink a glass of heated oil every day, but it's unlikely that such a high-alorium diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is this about the original way of life that keeps people young?
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter that she's never tired of going back and forth.
There are eight people living under the same roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who has had grandchildren for a long time.
There's also two babies riding around.
There's tea in the kitchen for the guests, which is served in typical belly glasses to the Armud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under her head scarf, she hides the long, dark, russian braids that her son proudly exposes to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaev.
A monthly pension is enough for a living.
She always ate only what she grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought a grocery store in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after World War II.
But it got better when Heydar Aliyev, "the beloved father," got up at the helm.
Propaganda doesn't often sound like an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who rules the country as a dictator, knows virtually no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
The 230 manats (approximately the same amount of the euro) Mirzaev receives monthly as a pension, which for local conditions is the amount on which to live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long - growing son is also right: "Stars in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happiness.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word "human right" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of the country ' s deep divisions.
A future sharia-based constitution met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president wasn't niggardly about the paphos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, who are still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state in the Nile of the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. from the U.S. University of Southern California really wants to save is not quite clear to Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be disenfranchised?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged into a 15-hour night jump with obstacles at an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that legal proceedings are based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal luft that emerges from it to interpret the sharia more strictly.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases concerning the Shariah, the Al-Achar University, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in the council.
This should not be the case, but may mean that the clergy supervise the law, which would have the effect of restricting the judiciary.
Much is being interpreted in the draft constitution
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to a military court must remain.
These courts served during Mubarak ' s period to suppress opponents.
Since the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values."
Legally, this is so unclear that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature through this article.
An open text means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
But another forbids insulting and slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It was also questionable that "insulting people" was prohibited.
Will there be enough cartoons for the president or jokes about a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Mursi is proposing for signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back."
The opposition against Islamist superiority has been forming for weeks now.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution had a place "in the history dump."
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away," said oppositionman Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," quoted Egyptian media outlets from Khaled Ali's opposition policy.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have rendered it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but it was a precaution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the veils and Salafites, who cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi, "Purify the country," and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which it began triggered a state of almost civil war.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now it is time for the people to decide in the ballot box where the country should go.
The majority for the Islamist project is considered a settled case.
"The notion of "human rights" is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sa ' eed is furious about this accelerated constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EPO) defended Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For that, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The extension of Mursi's influence on all three branches of government in the State disappoints counsel.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening a civilian State, the President has de facto annulled it," Saed regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be payback for this.
A demonstration in Tahrir Square warns: "You create a monster you can't control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million Norwegians have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with local addiction to one extremely sinister fish dish?
Take some over-swimmed cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna have the wrong smell of racficus, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but in the air there's an indestructible characteristic odour.
Raqfisk is a trout that is salted and wandered in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of sweetheart it is to achieve.
As the twilight thaws and coldes, the crowds of Norwegians gather at a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, let's say, exciting dish.
"They eat raw and drink a shot of aquavit, a local twilight vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-chair of the "racfiscal general" who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat little cubes of fish and drink a lot of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit better than a racfisque," Haward says.
This drink can break the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad, it's not much different from the sushi you took with you on the bus for a long time.
Raqfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, before refrigerators appeared, fish were wrapped in hermetically closed salt water barrels in the fall.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had already been fermented well and thoroughly, they were taken out and consumed with a reduced perception of alcohol.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mostly to the United States, is a memory of the past generation.
The population is now growing rapidly - more than 13 per cent of the population are immigrants, who are attracted by jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago a much richer neighbour) come here to work on a large scale.
Raqfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, though somewhat sinister, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's expensive here - a little beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears on the world news, and most of the country's population seems to be comfortable with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is referred to as "the 22 July incident."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens has been able to commit such atrocities and murders.
Norway ' s current prosperity is based on the growth (from the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, the rattle of the trays with the cuffed rackfish, the woman with the long blond hair and the amazing blue eyes, the expression of the Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks perfect English.
We don't like to show off, we're not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was stealing money they didn't have, Norway carefully counted all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough for you to be happy," says Anna.
"There is a rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food. I'm done with the racfisca.
This salmon hamburger is definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening, we'll have more of the same fish with the unforgettable smell.
My hotel has a special rakfisk dinner, during which voters determine the best or perhaps the most aromaous fish.
There's a live teleether that shows the lead in a bow tie surrounded by racketeering plates.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what's your rating for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, here's our assessment..."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, probably over-drinking the aquavit.
Or maybe just breathing on the smell of this fish.
The Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, will have a difficult career start.
As the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country ' s population.
Road traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly deplorable state.
This city has been overwhelmed by transportation and at a better time, and since Monday steel barriers have been erected, cutting several key roads to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential dressing and take over the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which was now laying down its powers, but the country was caught in the drug war, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence," reported earlier this week to US President Barack Obama in the White House's oval office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto ' s political career as President of his home state of Mexico City developed alongside the President of the United States.
In his home country, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country's capital, views on a new leader were divided.
You're a human being.
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
The inhabitants paid tribute to the revitalization of tourism, the development of resorts and the establishment of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which differ greatly from the roads with the potholes and pits that used to be in this place, is accessible to the city.
His name tags are on the modern building of the sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We hope with him for real and serious change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from the Peña Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous power, the PRI party was displaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence from the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of immateriality made by the new President by the opposition.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his vision for the future of the country.
It's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in the other part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this megacities.
Earlier this year, troops had been mobilized to quell drug gangs in those areas; and violence against women was particularly severe.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near an extensive landfill in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico State during Mr. Peña Nieto ' s governorship, a figure far higher than that in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became negative when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, at best, he had been unable to cope with the problem of femicide during his term as Governor.
In the worst case, however, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A woman from a concrete house like most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Iriney Buendia, has difficulty holding back tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to Marianne's official version, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body was washed before that," Ms. Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already rigged.
Mariana's mother tells the story, and the daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to a crucifix that has only one word written on it: justice.
This is what they said was denied to this family.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip girl, an angry peacebreaker.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it's not right, especially when there's so many irregularities and shortcomings around," she says.
When President Peña Nieto puts on a presidential bandage on Saturday, he will assume a heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to make this issue a priority during his tenure.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Oliver, congressman from Valle de Bravo from PRI.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the ill-treatment, he's charging.
The prosecutors are attempting to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning ' s detention conditions were harsh.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution attempted to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment that he said he had been able to transfer while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the weekly visits of the prison administration to Manning during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence ' s motion to dismiss Manning ' s case on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was carried out the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed after Manning's visits by representatives of the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he had been under severe conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he assessed his treatment by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning was specifically asked about the conditions of his detention, Fane claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his oral concern about those problems and that the representatives of the Administration who visited him had discussed those problems and had stated that they would do so but had not recorded it in writing.
"They wrote "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission considering the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to be removed from the injury prevention regime and to ease the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that a limited regime of imprisonment - lower than a surveillance regime to prevent suicide - had been introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them canceling the injury prevention regime... so my standard of life will improve, in my view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait and that one day he had lost consciousness because of the heat.
He explained that it was psychologically difficult when you were not allowed to know how your fate was resolved and what was happening in the outside world.
"My world held back to Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning reportedly spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave a mattress, blanket, slappers, some clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because he could sleep or even lie down during the day, forbid the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly struck with light from outside the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face when he was turning in bed at night, he said he was woke up and forced to turn over his back.
Manning ' s lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning ' s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning inspection.
Manning said he couldn't cover up with a blanket during the check.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the security officer's order that he should throw a blanket that he could cover up, but admitted that no one specifically ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning stated that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer he could use gum or scams to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slappers and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had experienced during his detention and substantially reduce his sentence in the event that Manning was found guilty by a military court, which was due to start his trial early next year.
The defence stated that it was planning to ask Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes, while other charges were being challenged as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the maximum security regime for detainees.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, illegally facilitating the publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defence and stealing State property or documents.
If convicted on all counts, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a story from an American of Mexican origin.
In the author ' s view, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico for lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked through the arrival corridor, approached the border control zone and froze on the ground.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I focused on the complex design of "American of Mexican descent."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than language speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered that story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The usual issues for the Presidents of those countries were immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto willingly spoke of the recovery of the Mexican economy, which will enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trade block like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto had promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals had been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and long-standing issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at gunpoint.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of all these events.
Therefore, only a U.S. state actor should speak with a word of criticism towards Mexico, the press, and the elite of Mexican society immediately complain that Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montesuma are filled with militancy.
However, Mexico ' s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
You want to talk about resentments?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in that country, and those who don't.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican origin for just one reason: at some point in their family history, no one, father or grandfather, had the opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not what Mexico sees.
Today, our life is an expression of American dreams, and we went to good schools and did good work, but we can't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country we consider our own.
United States of America.
And we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We answer them the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as fake Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain right now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, which reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances are Mexican Americans who do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of the two worlds, you're bound to lose your roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the U.S., we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my trip, as if our relationship was already not sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent her in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much hurt in the past.
Given the gap between rich and poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by the way in which their relatives were treated in Mexico most recently.
Yeah.
I guess we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The usual, pointless debate over who started it; many buildings were turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians have been hopelessly trapped in their eternal conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" have surrounded the mutiny storm with many established realities, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that rocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons that give rise to hope of overcoming this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation is not encouraging.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, is implemented, the clashes that took place this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement that came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will declare that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Although some faction leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
With the increasing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas has developed new powerful and rich friends.
Turkey ' s resurgent regional leader, once Israel ' s closest ally among Muslim countries, had supported Hamas; it had been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
The celebratory supporters of Hamas claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by Hezbollah's paramilitary group, to Syria, where the increasingly pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad's authority, and further to Jordan, where the King's authorities threaten Hamas's allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country in Egypt, where under President Mohammed Mursi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator with little focus on Hamas support.
On the other hand, Muslim brothers are an organization much similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to be populist.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hard line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system, the Iron Dome, justified the cost of its construction and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained faithful to its constant position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly through the wall entering the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State - and to protect Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January - joined with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman is very convenient.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they were to hand over all the power in the West Bank, would they start firing rockets from there towards Israel, as did their fellow citizens in the Gaza Strip?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempt to lift their heads.
The supporters of the hard line may win; however, their calculations may be refuted in the Arab spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere, have less affection for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel's defense budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of a war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of President Mursi of Egypt, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to the same extent, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression was already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbated those problems.
The bloody operations that have been carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas have to be paid for by the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
The only solution that remains to be called for by sound representatives on both sides, as well as by most of the rest of the world and our newspaper, is the formation of two States and the transfer of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which had long had decided to block arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, had a better position than ever before to persuade Hamas to recognize the Jewish State ' s borders adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace settlement plan.
Upon his return to the White House, he continues to show reluctance to engage in the solution of the problem.
This is a catastrophicly shortsighted attitude.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The Uniform Package for Cigarette Act has entered into force in Australia.
Warnings of the harm caused by smoking and images of diseased body parts are contrasted with sad green boxes similar to all brands of cigarettes.
Australia ' s first worldwide law on identical packaging of cigarettes and tobacco has come into force, replacing logos and colouring with a similar box of depressing olives with creepy images of sick parts of the body and images of children whose health is affected by the smoking of their parents.
In addition to different images and signs warning against smoking, the only difference between packs that are mandatory on Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small prints.
These are the harshest tobacco packaging conditions in the world.
The Australian Federal Government states that the purpose of this measure is to discourage young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful fashionable habit.
This decision was based on studies that showed that people who had not started smoking before the age of 26 had never become smokers in 99 out of 100 cases.
"It is clear that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia is one of the countries with the world ' s lowest share of smokers, so that these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering adopting such measures.
The tobacco industry was strongly opposed to the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences different from those of its proponents," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Counterfeit producers from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the other hand, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that demand for portigar and silicon casebooks that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (in practice from zero) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case to the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold some 6,000 products to wholesalers and is awaiting a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
Experts believe that the popularity of social media among the target population is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the enactment of a number of laws in Australia that had made illegal television advertising and support for cigarettes, and had prohibited sellers from putting cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising had moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from posting advertisements online, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet will seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, who studied public health issues at Sydney University.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written on behalf of alleged regular users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a private citizen who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't spare time and time and made a video video, or is there a advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry had even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: those States were suing within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all those countries ' trade relations with Australia were very small.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the Government had discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory smoking warning photos.
This rule has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrably not subject to innovation.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just picking up a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me leave is my little girl.
James Yu, the manager of the tobacco shop King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that the same packaging made it more difficult to place the goods in the shelves.
"I've had an hour before my new shipment went off, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and completely banned cigarettes, we would have said, "What to do, okay, it's over, we're closing the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
It's not so bad to miss the world of electronic networks and permanent connections.
On this Thanksgiving day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and neither books, magazines, iPhone, nor even duty-free stores will help.
Recently, however, more and more children's development scientists and professionals have expressed their preference for boredom.
They say it's not so bad to miss us and our children in certain situations.
This causes the brain to become distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all standing in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Do we need to seek boredom?
Yeah.
At the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many others, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tui, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011."
"In fact, boredom can brag about a very old story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions of boredom dating back to the first century were found.
However, the question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research on the subject and asking a 100-person task force, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want but cannot do what would satisfy them."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do something he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when I'm apathetic.
The main boredom, he says, is "a lack of attention and a consequent deterioration in mood and the sense that time is slow."
According to the boring description, it may seem very depressing.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and in circumstances, and depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study "The Unemployed Mind: A Definition of Boring in terms of Attention," published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment where participants listened to the recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises unrelated to the television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds in the low volume, so they could barely be removed, and a third group listened only to the recording of the voice without an external soundtrack.
Those who heard a TV with a low volume level said that they were bored, more often than not - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know why and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neurology at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking into the flow of goods on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom. '
It is believed that he continues that when people start waving on a chair or drawing scrambles on a piece of paper, they do so out of boredom, but now we know that such actions are actually just helping not to relax physically.
"The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to crawl and spin learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored when we delay the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, looking at an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special "calculus of boredom" to measure these individual characteristics.
Questions and assertions are used to measure such a scale, such as "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I'm too interested, so there's no time to do anything."
Through such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys miss more girls than girls, " says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially when there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said that they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said that they were bored outside the school.
Only 3% of parents said that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what kind of boring data would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "adolescents have the highest tendency to be bored," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my initial question, is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because, in extreme terms, research shows that it can push people into absurd and dangerous physical acts, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers were thinking about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanović, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain doesn't always know what it's best to do.
If you're bored and you channel that energy to a guitar game or cooking experiments, you'll do better.
But if you watch TV, you'll only feel better for a while, and it'll be over soon.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or otherwise manage his time and employment, " says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-management skills are used in a variety of situations," he argues.
Your child learns not only to do things on his own, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think boredom needs to be praised.
But there's no need to think of her as bad either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even beyond the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so that we need to get bored more often, but boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unsatisfied desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to somehow get out of constant concern and just relax.
"In today's world, we are accustomed to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses, " he says, "and when silence comes, we lose and don't know what to do."
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and student at a community college in southeast Colorado, was charged with a criminal offence, which would soon be completely legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that he and his friends had once been in Lamara in September and had been driving in a prairie car near the border with Kansas when they had been stopped by the police.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and drugs - minor offences for which a $100 fine was payable - and a court hearing date was set.
"We're being treated like criminals," says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has lasted for weeks since Colorado voted to legalize the use of small quantities of marijuana for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of minor cases depends not so much on the law as on the venue.
The charges of minor marijuana offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
The police stations have already stopped charging people 21 years of age and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal once the law enters into force in a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to deal with the existing marijuana cases and continue to be held responsible for the possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, there is a vote to prevent new State-licensed marijuana shops from appearing in their places.
"It's all going so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in Aurora town east of Denver.
Control officials in the state of Washington are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which should be done by 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, whether it's good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, the market is more orderly, so it will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the D.C. Alcohol Regulatory Board.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith recognizes than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent on which we could be guided," he says.
The Washington State Bill, referred to as I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will put the state in a state of uncertainty for a whole year when State licensing systems are not yet in place and possession of marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's regulation on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana, with a ban on selling it 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses in urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established research group Centre for the Legalization of marijuana.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates stating that the City's Public Prosecutor's Office would no longer hold persons aged 21 to account for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stopped accusing people of these violations "starting from that moment."
The Chief of Police, Oates, said that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the regulations governing medical marijuana growers and prosecute drug traffickers and traffickers.
The Weld District Attorney in north Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to receive treatment.
To date, 119 persons have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many have been accused of other violations.
"It is the duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the already open cases of possession of marijuana.
"I think it's our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people of Colorado who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reactions of the people in different parts of the state revealed the mixed attitude of the local authorities towards the state's marijuana experiment.
"The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard," explains Sean McAlister, Denver lawyer representing the interests of marijuana convicts, and a local representative of the National marijuana law reform organization.
"They've been chasing people for so long, they can't really accept that this isn't a crime anymore," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states in which a small amount of marijuana is treated in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become an experimental field nationwide to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials are planning to expand the legalized trade, but they are waiting with fear for instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients using marijuana on medical grounds, the Federal Government has in most cases benefited from the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The Anti-Narcotics Bureau agents are unlikely to break into houses to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the state-controlled recreational marijuana stores that are authorized under the new law, as Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser to the Obama administration, says.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which could not have opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we give someone a license, and then it's gonna cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother went to Oxford and described him as the world's best educational institution, the modern analogy of an antiquity symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the University of Oxford College of History in the late '80s, I packed my bags and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer, E. Normann Wilson, was joking that I left because I had to drink from the sherbet cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically bullied and intimidated.
It wasn't because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenedness it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the now-dead Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a conservator.
You're gonna ask me why you have to think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with a right-wing, center-right attitude is being subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those accorded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the Christie College Student Club in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the Equal Rights Committee of the College in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "The Country of Wonders: Young, Smart and Right," in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, who drives around the Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver snack.
In other universities, student conservatives complain that they make "scape assholes" because of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of Conservatives of Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "in the university environment, there is a growing leftist bias.
People who don't even know us think we're insolent and violent children of rich parents in advance."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student at the College of History at Corpus Christy College, who filed a motion for enhanced protection, calls this atmosphere "unsettling," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of Oxford University, says that the attitudes of the students' club towards right-wing centrists have deteriorated considerably.
"It is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and to the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a shy and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish from hating a conservative party.
One year earlier, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, had been deprived of her honorary degree by a vote because of a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the early days of the freshman week, when students meet each other and teachers, I first felt that I was waiting for me.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of student conservatives, but also enjoyed participating in it themselves.
Political issues - the mining strike, privatization and the Government ' s opposition to sanctions against the apartheid Government in South Africa - have infiltrated the wooden walls of audiences.
At my first seminar, I needed to translate the eighteenth century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the deceased Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
It was hard for me to get the text, I was stuttering.
Harry Pitt was a very gallant man with a face that looked like cake.
"The Thatcherists don't really learn French, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few early lessons from French in your spare time, unless you're very busy turning around in society," Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting at lunch alone, and then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Department, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of University Conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Everyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be bullied.
It's hard for me, and in your case, they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most freshman conservatives pretend they're Labour."
Later, in the local pub, I tried to be cowardly.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the prosecution was abolished in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to go out with like-minded people just in the middle of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourian and hide my true beliefs?
The three years ahead of me seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, was the only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views.
He was hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speakers.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettyness, and dedication to the Marxist deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started going to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial capital friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he complained.
- They can't do that. Not in a city of drowsy spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved perfectly."
His moist eyes are clouded.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted from a permanent trip to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also the conservative, has failed to resist pressure and to give up his beliefs.
The following week, during the seminar, when another history teacher called me "the enemy of the people" quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
In the heart of shame, I admitted that I was brainwashed by my parents, and I called them "old fools."
The break wasn't long.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to hit my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdock's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and after five minutes, my stalkers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen prime ministers of tory, but is still hiding behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory."
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nathy Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz and other famous Italian designer clients
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to receive an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the discovery of Valentino: Master of sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, whose only character is "or signore" Garavani, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobles.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened before 3 March, there are many personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise, from a humble tailor from the town of Voger in northern Italy to a idol of international "elita."
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"At least they don't put their cigarette butts on your gorgeous rug, like some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornhamitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an incredible host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains former wife "Hini" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anelli or Eugenia Niarjos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to glory.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valerie Mazza recalls the charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner at his house, which was after a fashion show in Spain's square in Rome, years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - every detail of his apartment, in its tidy, in its food, in music.
"All of Valentino's guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model," whose work with the modeler began in 1995 during High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion because his designs are real artwork," she ends.
Pedestrian Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessiveness, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's gallerys has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre runway, which offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of models and should defiltrate the runway by looking at "spectators" from dreams that sparkle with Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti used in the Nights, or the coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Fara Dib.
In this audience, names such as Sybilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn und Taxis, Mette-Mart of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg are glittering from models.
Nati Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like first love, "unforgettable."
I remember him perfectly.
They were pants, shirt, jacket, and jackets from the autumn winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Nathy Abaskal, one of the designers' museums.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light in them and they "come" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed I'd have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to the party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with trimmings, a corsage in a fold, and a slit without a ribbon.
"It was a dream that came true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a modeler with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories accompanying him."
The King of Fashion
The Great End of the Somerset House Expo is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler calls his seams) to make this silk-colored elephant with pearls, twelve types of lace and a plume of four and a half metres.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority in the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in the high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the higher world."
Over the years, the elite's "life style" has become Valentino's best representative.
The Grand Cross (the distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Labour Cavalier, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Spokenness, awarded by the Order of Honor to the Legion, Garavani has gathered as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"I've always drawn my attention to his subtlety, his calm, his neat and impeccable appearance," says Dr. Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at the Orse Museum.
He sat at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribé, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The worst profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijena
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of a volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living from the production of sulphur in the Kawah Ijen volcano located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto goes down to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
Large pieces of sulphur with a total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, picks up baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up the cliff road.
To the top of a volcano of 2,386 metres, it is only 250 metres high, but it takes more than 40 minutes for exhausted movers to climb up with a turtle step, with difficulty in keeping their balance and a careful search of the road so that they do not retreat or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as it happened to a tourist from France who blew off the Kawah-Ijena Rock a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah-Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for each kilo of sulphur they produce.
On their way upstairs, they set themselves a road between tourists who photograph them, as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the scales that the mining company laid just above, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
This is the PT Kandi Ngribi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better or less, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) to the petrochemical industry, as it is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As 70 kg is the norm, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," explains Anto, who usually carries three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end he feels broken, but they allow him to save 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a miser for such a inhuman effort, it's three times more than he would make in the field.
"The daily payment to miners is very high by local standards, where the coffee collection is paid by Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and the average monthly earnings equals Rs. 2 million (Euro167) ," explains a trucker who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a valid reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where the Hindus alone are the only ones, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto has asthma, he can barely breathe, he coughs all the time, and his eyes are tearing off because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Ijena, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special points.
He's got asthma, he's barely breathing, he's coughing, and he's got eyes tearing off because of toxic gases that produce a volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
A life-punished, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a hotel porter, but instead he does a mule job.
The case of a dirty wooden cabin with other porters, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur continues to flow at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
In order to challenge the shadows, Anto goes down into the crater, lighting his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters drag boxes of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of a volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the production of sulphur to save costs and did not provide any equipment to porters who worked for themselves and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even a portion of the 30,000 rupees (Euro2.5) photographing fee, which, along with the 15,000 rupees (Euro1.2) entrance ticket, the guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
"This is a work for cattle, not for people," says Badrosin, a root porter for 42 years, who has spent three decades on Kawah-Ijean since leaving college.
A man who can lift up to 110 kilos, he assures us that he will endure the work "as long as he can ' because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because a volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains of their serious illnesses... more serious, obviously than their usual breathing problems, arthroses, knee pains, and ulcer on their shoulders, which have deformed under the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, the Unainick can only lift 50 kilos in his 53 ' s.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres along a narrow path among the bushes.
"I'm not gonna retire, I'm gonna die here because a volcano is my whole life," Unainick says, wide-opening mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, also works as a carryer of sulphur.
Time is running out, but poverty perpetuates one of the world's hardest jobs from generation to generation: what human mules do with Kawah Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeers blame their careers, stress and housing and education prices for their lack of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm the husband of a patriot, you're my wife of a patriot, you're gonna do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint towel commercials, but despite this - or perhaps as a result - the video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's fertility rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, the BBH, has the hope that they will be able to draw attention to this issue in entertainment form through advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic that we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, to launch pheromones spirits or organize quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they do not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can do to solve this problem, that is, make up a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends US$ 1,300 a year on politics to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax relief.
But it's all of low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city State in South-East Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and for its strict social control.
Singapore ' s fertility rate, according to its National Population Authority, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was lower than 2 - known as the substitution rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Couples and Families Policy Department of the National Population Directorate, said that the reason for this was "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"It allowed people to have a wider range of options with regard to life's goals and priorities beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of singles and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decline in Singapore ' s fertility rate.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims at a sharp increase in immigration to counter population decline, is an outrage among the local population.
Singapore has websites where barely hidden xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party achieved the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the nation ' s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditures and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has moved to control the number of small apartments known as the shoe box that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These apartments, 46 square metres, are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a perception that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, the CEO of the building firm EL Developers, says that their shoeboxes are sold much faster than the larger copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments of larger size.
As a result, our income is increasing.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules provided clearer guidance to developers who had previously been prevented if they wished to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too tense.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards an increase in national fertility, after talking to the Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the centre, it seems that they will have little effect.
"People are very tense, housing is expensive, as is education, and that's why many people put it off," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to their children, Singapore has the final word.
Private offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a private or "private sphere that has the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social media?
Does he understand the dangers to which the Internet is exposed in dealing with situations that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeriódico interviewed five kids aged 10 to 15, who were frequently network users.
On four occasions, they associated the term with "something very mine," on a personal plane, and "user password and name," when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't download," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain personal meanings on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had records for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he argues.
On the FB, I load beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I'm also having fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish indecent pictures of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures me that he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Mother knows she has a password to one of the records.
I made Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweetes.
"I don't know if I'm being answered, I'm just downloading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends quickly," he says.
Without wondering, she says she would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open records on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand me, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy has experience with what is now known as cyber-mending.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and charged with money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures me.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps for setting the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download pictures of people he knows in uncomfortable or confidant situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Though I know it's cyber mobbing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a teacher in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a tool to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, a teacher at Yale University and author of Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
Explains that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion that can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is insufficient."
"So that they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the best way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do so is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like it if they published a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that other people are publishing about you?
When you sign pictures from parties, do you ask permission from other people to celebrate?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to act online the way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"On the Internet, a man behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and must also be on social media," she argues.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education and consultant in education, explains the need for family heads to faithfully read social media policies.
Understanding each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the preconditions for opening an Internet record.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
The UNASUR Summit ends without the declaration of the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was concluded today in Peru, without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven binding parties.
Efe has tried several times to access a document signed at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Office of the President indicated on the front page that it would be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian Government ' s website.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during brief press statements.
Journalists ' access to information about the Summit was always limited.
It was only broadcast during the day, in the press room, a video of the Presidential Assembly without sound, with a message "closed meeting, no sound."
A few of the information that was circulated among reporters was transmitted by the spokespersons of some UNASUR Governments attending the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which led to frustration among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President's Administration sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is a statement by Umala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and that time the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not disseminated, despite the insistence of the press.
The official ASPA website can be checked that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had tried to ensure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but had limited access to information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict by the Hague Court, which would resolve the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague, to hear the statements of both parties, in the context of the indictment that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently bringing before this international court," Umala said, next to his Chilean colleague.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Umala with shaking his hand against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice occurred immediately after Colombia challenged this week the Pact of Bogotá, under which it recognized that the verdicts of that international court were subordinated to those of Nicaragua following a decision on maritime boundaries that it considered to be wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rucef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christine Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011, following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon in Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which stated that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved for South American countries, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements he had adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements."
He reported that action was being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, affordable Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters."
Since Europe is in crisis, "economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis, but should serve to broaden our productive base and anticipate a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that would improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in the message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were from Peru and were limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, while two were aimed at a strong link with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to re-accede to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before participating in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner a maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court contested by Bogotá.
"The day after Saturday, I might meet with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, which are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua, which will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can handle this as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will have a new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also in the framework of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter's participation has been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the goal of "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, declared to Peruvian State television that Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one country."
He defended, in this context, the South American Nationality Project, which was endorsed by the UNASUR participating countries.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to put us back in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown his support for the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) as a precondition for reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and for taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanjo.
Correa affirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that, in due course, "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not follow the process."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning regarding an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of a deterioration in Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a minor pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What really exists is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any human being," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assanjo since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of inviolability that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights; we do not use that word here, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he said, "If Britain provides security tomorrow, it's over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Señor Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or asks him for Skype, tomorrow the problem will be over.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate "mediacy, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt villains politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, "no bankers, no hegemonic bourgeois countries dominate Ecuador," and added that, once re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue the development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR until at least the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality" because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered the desire of his Colombian colleague, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision has not yet been respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
They need to be processed together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile would be brought to a good conclusion in the same court and said that it was "right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries committed themselves to taking a decision, however difficult it might be."
With regard to the possibility of standing as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he was considering the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it was sometimes difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost in the elections in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be redressed by political power.
"My political movement thought I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If won, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"It's a solution," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chávez's health is deteriorating," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS Deaths Today - The Results of Late Diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test was positive.
"I've been stunned," he recalls, in spite of all the tactics of the doctor, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts came true - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital, where he reached in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and it would have been hard to believe at the beginning of the 1990s - there were too few treatment options at that time, too little knowledge of the disease, too much prejudice against the sick.
So even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Welfare didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "destroyed" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement to date is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," pointed out the head of the HIV unit, HAC, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing that this information had been confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectionist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depend on the extent to which the immune system is affected by patients at the start of diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with 200 CD4s, and up to 50 years, with 500 CD4s reported.
To put it simply, the foregoing means that a person who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at 25 years of age, according to these terms, "by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that Mexicans today have an average life expectancy of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been recorded by May of this year; however, it is alleged that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I picture it, that's how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we've had no shortage of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, late stages of the disease.
He cited breaking data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have an opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to be diagnosed at an earlier stage, and therefore there is a need to provide mass detection samples for all people who request it."
The proposal brings together specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who applied to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by the fact that his friend did so and, despite his young age, he was already at the AIDS stage and even suffered from the sarcasm Caposha, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get kicked three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person," Fabrizio said, "who agreed to share his personal life with MILEÑO JALISCO in order to promote his statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, in fear.
Let them check if there is a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
His presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gap between health programmes and the common citizen is large, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has addressed the issue of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this problem, "it's actually increased the distribution of condoms, we've been given one or two before, now we're given a hundred bags, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they to you?" that is a popular question, with sedition and condemnation by social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health workers who don't want to hear from teenagers, was assured by a promoter.
I suggest changing this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters, and that a hundred of them be in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
It's not encouraging promiscuity.
This is not a matter of payment for beer and motel, and Governor Emilio González replied when asked whether it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
A total of 13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) were recorded.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of the infections are from the sexual route, 6% from the blood route and 2% from the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between four and five people who do not know for one registered case.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
Procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law do not seem to be valid in the country of stripes and stars, in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlene Hale in the Texas Northern District bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms defenceless in the face of the possibility of seizure of their property across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the doors to a leading window manufacturer in Mexico to apply to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge points out that creditors should be governed by the United States bankruptcy code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to competition proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the revocation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for that purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been created, defining the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without inter-firm voting, which is recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had Vitro subsidiaries in front of the parent company, the majority required for the approval of restructuring would not have been achieved.
Nevertheless, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-firm debts have been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competition.
It is also true that by deducting the votes of subsidiaries, in one way or another, Vitro creditors who fought against him in United States courts, namely vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
Voting would be 45 per cent versus 37 per cent.
These data are omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation she has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced in attacking the country.
For the time being, the Gonzalez Sad family company will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote can reach its plenary, i.e., five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for certification would be submitted, which would require a review by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worse still, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican Government as amicus curiae (the "other court"), which described the process that Vitro was following under the Competition Act, indicating that it was exempting itself from the agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
It is also noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for inter-State insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
In view of the months-long complaints placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviación unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Union Association of Air Pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The office headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic concerning an operation carried out by an entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed towards the purchase of shares of the Hotel Professional Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
They're surrounded by Dragon Mart.
Meeting on a weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of common civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to confront the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, of products from an isolated country, with a residential area near 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had succeeded in bringing together the governors of the south-east zone to confront the monumental forces that had levelled off some of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
ACTA Death
With regard to the Government ' s rejection of the Senate ' s request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the abstraction in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the Senate itself disqualifying the possibility of treating it as violating freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts without affecting the short-term, the housing developer, Homex, places 500 million pesos worth of Exchange Certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, offering interest every 28 days.
Competival appears in the light
Created by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just come to light, its goal will be to market software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, a busy basketball traveler, has been involved in this sport for over 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before the brain haemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was trapped in sports for over 60 years, as a small-scale player, as a player of the High Basketball League, authorized and head of the BSN with Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as I was President of BSN, Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalls during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all the pictures and memorials gathered for his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or agent of a contract.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent, or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's debut at BSN.
Since then, Kuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has been the leader, said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and at Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want some?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who acquired citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought the Championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Minsi in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the United States during an Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we won fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who made us play the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and crashed the United States team, which was quite like the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Minsey, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and Piculina (Ortisa) play that team again, but also the young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' Morales, who were unable to participate in the 1990s due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifications Tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role players like 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea, and a young Rolando Hurruitner, instead of those temporarily suspended for disorder at the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculien Ortiz.
His performances at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level like Piculien did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendas, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the federation?
In the early 1990s, the BSN team held up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things I wanted to do, like regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, to have boys from Ponce play only in their own field and only against teams from other parts of the island in national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's too much.
At least I see the benefits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-renowned by his leading role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.," in a television series called Dallas, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil predator J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night due to cancer complications, according to a family statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a production studio in Dallas.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, playing once again the role he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and sequel, was next to Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, said her representative, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, gentle and talented, and I'm gonna miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray confirmed in the application.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and suffered a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman became famous on television because of the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden, and starts living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedians who rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well accepted by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his workshop interpretation of the delicious J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of the glory.
The drama show of the CBS channel about the Ying clan and other characters in its environs was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advert "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create a noise around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character was almost killed, generated international debate and millions of dollars at risk in bookstores.
It also helped attract a record audience to the show at that time.
When the response was given in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second-largest entertainment programme in history, after the 1983 "MASH" final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine, who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and a wrong husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put in treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s gravestone," said Hagman in 1988.
It has to be said, "There's an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing here."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Princeipal, also the character of the original show, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "large, both on and off screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who has been fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season had already been completed and the sixth one was in production, reported by the channel.
Warner or TNT have yet to make a statement about what happens to the show after Hagman left.
He was the son of an actress and singer, Mary Martin, born in Fort Wharth, Texas, who starred in classic works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to Ben Hagman's lawyer.
He tried to be happy in the theatre of New York in the early 1950s and then served in the England Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, Mai Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything in there that would feel capable of hurting someone or influencing them in any way," he said at the time.
After his liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that the End of the World explores begins.
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when religious professor Stuart Sharma decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible bait: the end of the "long reverse" of the Mayan calendar, 21 December, which many people seized as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what it was going to be like in the next few months: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some call "dongarmageddon," and a growing conflict to which Israel would be drawn, a place where Christian theorists of the end of time thought that the Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If we look at what's happening in the world today, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he's not the only professor who's offering courses on "the end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analysing why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analysed films for apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," Wacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Professor of Art History and Anthropology, came together to read a course called "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "undesirable destruction," students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will take place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until the very night at which the world is expected to end," said Restall.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
"The bridge ended in two hours," said Restal about his high-middle-point student course, which was attended by 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, to Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, whether secular or religious, is just a question of comfort or lack of comfort.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach that," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project affected the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University from West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key moment on the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which spans several centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused these speculations to increase.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, implying a superior order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal noted that many days of the last trial had been mentioned for a long time and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people would immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some say they're gonna go to the end of the world parties.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Department of Communications, commented.
