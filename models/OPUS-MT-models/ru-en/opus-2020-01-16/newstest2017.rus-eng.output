28-year-old cook found dead at the San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he can't imagine someone who would want to hurt him by saying, "In the end, things were going well for him."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, reported to the San Francisco Forensic Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim ' s brother, Luis Galicia, told the KGO television and radio channel ABC in San Francisco that Frank, a former producer of the Boston distribution line, got his job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and will miss him very much," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying in the hostels first, but lately, "He's finally got things going well."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Luis Galicia said KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to make us a meal, to make us dinner," said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who sailed through the flow.
"With all the bad things that happen to this world, he was the unburned diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
All those in possession of the information are asked to call the SFPD Hot Line number 415-575-4444.

"I think the discussion was useful to us, and we gave them information about what happened," said Churkin.
He explained that, in closed consultations, he had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation expressing "concern and outrage at the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea."

Italy's public debt has increased to record levels
Italy's debt in June 2016 exceeded 2.248 trillion euros.
At the Central Bank, the country stated that the amount was a historical maximum and was transferred to RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.
That's when the government's debt reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that Italy's debt burden increased by Euro77.2 billion in the first half of the year.
It was previously reported that, at the end of 2015, Italy ' s public debt was 132.7 per cent of its GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoan, projected a decline of 130.9 per cent in 2016 and 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
The airport paid 141 victims of the Domodedovo attack.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Foundation, which was established by the management of Domodedovo Airport to assist victims of the 2011 terrorist attack, is reported by Interfax.
According to Alexander Vlasov airport spokesperson, two more applications are under consideration.
"The Foundation continues to make charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and to provide full assistance in resolving the issues," Vlasov added, recalling that a fund's website had been set up specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, containing full information on how to provide charitable assistance.
In 2011, an explosive device was detonated by Domodedobo suicide in the foreign air service hall.
Thirty-seven people were killed in the attack and another 172 were injured.
Scientists found an animal that could live for 500 years.
An international group of biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits RT.
Scientists have performed a radiocarbon analysis of 28 Greenlandic sharks' eyes.
The largest shark with a length of more than five metres may be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, leading to slow development.
The females of Greenlandic sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the "near" shark - a Greenland whale - lived longer than all vertebrate animals.
The oldest known scientist was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Soviet Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin amended the Security Council of the Russian Federation by decree, reporting to the Kremlin press service.
It had previously been known that Putin had dismissed President Sergei Ivanov's chief of staff and succeeded Anton Vaino.
Ivanov will now serve as special representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
The permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation excluded the deputy secretary of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliev.
The Council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, half-presiding of the President in FLS, Sergei Mayilo, and half-presiding of the SZFO, Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been dismissed from his post as Chief of the Presidential Administration.
By presidential decree, Sergei Ivanov was removed from his position as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov has been appointed special representative of the Russian Federation on environment, environment and transport.
Anton Vaino, formerly Deputy Sergei Ivanov, was appointed as the new Chief of Administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to move to another job.
Should I go to a sanatorium if there's no health problem?
Our expert is the chief doctor of Olga Bogosh sanatorium.
And if a man is healthy, just tired of his job, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium and resort rest is essential not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of disease.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her condition and receive medical advice on how to live so that his or her health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be excessive to anyone.
"Just tired of working" is an important signal to the body, and it shouldn't be brushed off.
Persistent stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.
And the stress is about 90% of the visitors.
People from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are the most affected.
So it's best not to complicate things and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people have reduced their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend time with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programmes, which include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests and treatments.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children ' s pools), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and healing physical education.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor on the basis of individual testimony and the characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, there is usually a children's club with animators in sanatoriums, where children can attend play classes and various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to visitors with babies, provide thoracic facilities and an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, and the abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round vacation at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Vod.
And then it's not just summer that the body needs rest.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are done in-house and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region, of course, is the treatment of mineral sources: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovski, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
Water varies in temperature, number of salts, total mineralization, chemical composition and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on how the patient feels.
For example, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunodulative effect, restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the exchange of substances.
"Essentukey-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
The "Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, bile and urinary effect.
The water of Slavyanovsky has the same effects.
A doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system when assigning water.
If there are signs of hypertension, he picks up less salt water because salts hold the liquid, which increases pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires that the regime be observed: water should be consumed at the appropriate time, quantity and temperature.
Various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of rehabilitation based on the nature of the North Caucasus can be obtained at resorts in the region?
There is, for example, a saline lake called Tambukan near Pitigorsk, of which mud is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immune effect.
It's a health walk on individual routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take wine baths, pearl baths, iodine-bromos, selenium baths, lacric sage baths, depending on what your doctor appoints.
We're gonna extend the fertility.
What can we do to make the harvest go through the end of the season?
Says Julia Belopukhova, the agronomist and the lady.
It's time for the big tomatoes to have a haircut: remove the new stepsons, cut the tops, remove all the leaves to the last hand of the fruit, and flowers with small ligatures - they won't be able to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution," as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with an ash-Superphosphate extract, processed with biopreparatus (The driver is for the acceleration of the fill and growth of the fruit, Phytosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamayr, Bactofitis - for disease, Immunocytophyt - for the enhancement of immunity, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocide, Phytoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals used at the end of the summer, only copper coupos, colloid sulphur, and green soap should be used.
We're making the last flood of plants.
Long plaster cucumbers in the greenhouse are dropped from the spalera so that the lower, naked part of the stem is laid down on the ground, watered with warm water and a circon solution, and put a stalk of five to seven centimetres of compost.
It is not difficult to extend the fruiting of the coil either: cut off old leaves, pour warm water and complex fertilizer solution, and put fertile soil under the bush.
To protect you from the cold at night, put a cover arc above the arc.
Keep the plant open by day, and close the sun after sundown.
The signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia's exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to Bloomberg analysts, Russian GDP shows a positive trend, with GDP falling by 0.8 per cent per annum in the second quarter.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rosstat's latest data, the decline in the Russian economy slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been announced by Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic and Social Development.
Up ahead, slow growth.
According to CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP indicates that the recession has been left behind and that the economy is slowly growing ahead," says the Bank of Russia's bulletin, "What trends are talking about."
The monthly GDP estimate for the current quarter has been raised to 0.4 per cent by regulators, with an estimate of 0.5 per cent for the fourth quarter.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the Russian Federation ' s GDP fell by 0.2% in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleaned-up decline in GDP was 0.2% to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April, it was 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15," quoted by the representative of RIA's IER "News."
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that "the day has passed."
Among other markers indicating signs of recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg refers to increased demand for electricity and rail transport, a revival of business.
If it is corrected that the year is viscosity, it is clear that the evolution in plus 1% of electricity consumption may be due to half the additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
There are, however, other, more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressures.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the movement of the ruble, which, while showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has been strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year in August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery to be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy" - Yakovenko points out.
In addition, the Russian Federation has seen an increase in industrial output since April.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
The rate of decline in foreign trade is slowing from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.4 per cent, also shows positive developments.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the favourable situation in the labour market, the issue of real disposable incomes left much to be desired.
In annual terms, the rate drops by 4.8 per cent.
This factor may hamper economic recovery, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
In general, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the tight policies of the Bank of Russia can also be described as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
The low level of investment, which hampers the development of industrial capacity, is also a negative factor.
But in general, it can be expected that by the end of the year, the Russian economy will have slowed down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," says the GC analyst Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The naturalization process of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well settled in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been as active in summer sports.
While the Olympic Games in Rio promote Russia and former foreigners, most of them are natives of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
At the same time, in Rio, we can see a reverse process - quite a large number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of change of nationality varies.
Some of the parents took someone to another country when they were kids, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't compete for a seat in the Russian team.
And someone thought that abroad would create better conditions for development in sports.
AIF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be Elizabeth, of course.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Only four years later, as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps - to do light athleteics.
So did sister, Lisa chose to jump with six.
If she stayed in Russia, she wouldn't be able to move Elena Isinbayev from the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only landlady, even if she's an ex-boyfriend, in the six-jumping sector.
Her best achievements in this form of sport are the 2010 European Championship bronze and the 2016 continental silver she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Much because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight children in the family.
They all lived in a small town called Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting in high school.
With good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where at the United States Training Center she continued her classes under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Beaconnikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first fight.
At the World Championship that same year, it was a victory.
Before that, by the way, she had won silver at the 2010 World Championship.
It was followed by a bronze of 2013 and silver of 2014.
Maria, 26, was born in Yaroslavla, where she first met the synchronized swimming.
But saying she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
She soon joined the U.S. team and performed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is understandable that, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, it has a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christine Shaldybin at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue studying art gymnastics outside the ocean.
Until then, the girl had been engaged in a favorite sport in her native Jaroslavla.
Emigrating to the U.S., she quickly entered this country's youth team and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She certainly did not have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the United States, she set up a real breakthrough - bringing the star-painted team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former artists is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who is in support of Germany's team.
Jana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, though, Jana was only able to occupy 17th place, not enough to compete in the finals in his personal championship.
Two years earlier, however, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - the young ones.
Another gymnast, only this time the sports girl is Irina Sazonova.
While the emigration of the women mentioned earlier can be described as standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - specially coming to his home country to keep up with his skill.
In Rio, she wasn't as successful as she'd like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multi-fight.
There is very little information about swimmer Maria Ugolkova in Russian information space.
For a very long time, Mary has lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it had performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record at 200 meters of butterfly.
In 2015, she acquired Swiss citizenship and became a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is the 14th place in the 4x100 complex relay race.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdpending project, which enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for the Olympic preparations.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, the native of Hasavurt became a three-time winner of the European championships, Russia's champion, Russia's master of sports of the international class.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from a sports pole.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championship - Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a tournament at the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-rossian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his home country than even Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started his gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was his 40th place in parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her activities in synchronized swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl was ranked sixth in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
She was five on the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Creuter stands for Israel's team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, Dmitri became the country's champion at the age of 17.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
One year later, Creuter also wins the gold of the Young Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitri jumps in length and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavurt who, after long competitions for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania to represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he competed for the Redyarsk High School of Sports, even becoming the champion of the country in 2011.
==Biography==A 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow as a family member of the USSR volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the planet's best volleyball player.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained permanently there.
In 2015, he became a bronze winner of the European Championship in his new homeland.
Hadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and joined his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
Norway was the original target, but it was not possible to reach this northern country - it had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to learn the free fight.
He soon won the championship of peace among juniors and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be France's only representative in the fight tournament.
Once again, a free fight, and a former Russian.
This time we will talk about the native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, Tymuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the country ' s team.
Before that, however, a 30-year-old athlete was able to score high scores in Russia.
He became a bronze winner of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
The charter for non-completion, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital, Dagestan Mahačkale, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was 10 years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
Arthur started boxing there on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Condratiev, "it is not the stock and parades that should be raised systematically."
They need to grow up and realize from at least 7 years of age that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossacks.
But as far as I'm concerned, this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If Cossack classes take on all the positive things they've built up before, on a qualitatively new level, I'd be happy to.
If everything's inhaled and we don't know how, the new idea turns out to be cheap populism.
WKH continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country ' s economy.
There is an infringement on funds allocated to the public sector from different levels of budgets.
According to the Attorney General ' s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of HKH.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid more than 170 million roubles for energy.
The Krasnodar Krai Prosecutor ' s Office also found that unreasonable costs had been included in the tariffs.
In addition, 4 million rubles were charged to the costs of the VBO Consulting (cold water supply) for rental of vehicles at a price higher than the market price.
And there's a lot of examples like this across the country.
The people pay the final money for the "communist" and pay it well - according to the Ministry of the Interior, the average collection rate from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund that was repairing urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, which were not actually performed, but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money back.
As the owner of the CC, Makarov collected money from the public, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their own needs.
As a result, millions of rubles have been damaged by the budget and residents.
Makarov's scheme, alas, is typical of Russia.
A wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code who had appropriated money from citizens took place throughout the country.
The trial of A. Kohan is ongoing in Kamchatka, by the way, also by a former member of the council, who is accused of cheating on 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elizovo, Kamchat Krai, he established six management companies and three limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the PC, and the other two played the role of clearing houses, i.e., receiving money from the population.
However, A. Kohan spent money on his loved one, not on energy.
It's quite difficult to sue in the domain of HKH.
There's no case, there's no case.
And "helps" this very complicated housing law, " says Svetlana Krautnev, the executive director of the NP "JKH Control."
We don't have time to make one law, like we're making a new one that's supposed to make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on HKH.
Lawyers themselves recognize that very little attention is paid to housing law in higher education.
Refusals to institute criminal proceedings are also reported in the Office of the Attorney-General during investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes in court in 2015, less than half had been prosecuted.
The remaining investigations were protracted and one in five suspended owing to the failure to identify the accused.
Often, deficiencies in law enforcement are attributed to gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, with only 60 criminal cases initiated.
In the five months of this year, the number increased only slightly - 99.
And what's the falsification of the protocol of the residents' meeting?
This means that changes in the management of the house, financial and other matters go against the opinions of the owners.
It also means that the housing and utilities market cannot be broken down by normal companies that want to work honestly rather than milk the population.
So residents are minus, small and medium-sized, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the Committee of the State Duma on Property Matters, is confident.
This work is under way.
It is not just a single action; it is a deliberate effort to combat corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, scandals don't smell in the capital.
Why is there no scandal in Moscow in the area of HKH, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the government in the capital has shown iron will and brought order, " said AIF, Anatoly the Elected, a member of the Committee of the State Duma on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I am referring to both personnel issues and legislative amendments and legal education.
The management of the companies is under close supervision and all of them have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are resolved quickly in public space (and the residents ' appeals and response measures are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Not only do many pay monthly receipts, but they watch closely what it says about keeping the house.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus, Moscow verifies the validity of tariffs on housing and communal services, since a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
Perhaps all of this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all in the hands of the regional authorities?
Maybe you should change your place of work if you're not happy.
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the US?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, put forward an ultimatum to the United States, suggesting a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He stated this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan urged Americans to give up support for the "terrorist organization of fetkhullahists."
This is not the first statement from Turkey to call on the US to change its position.
Experts believe that Turkey's division with the West is increasing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"America will choose between Turkey and FETO sooner or later.
Either FETO's organizing coups or a democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice," quoted by the Anatoly Agency, Erdogan's address on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
Once again, the President of Turkey has demanded that the United States comply with his demand, which he made for the first time immediately following the suppression of the rebellion.
It should be recalled that, on the night of 16 July in Turkey, a high-ranking Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Recep Erdoğan had addressed the population, the rebellion had been suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, some 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, a resident of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdoğan's supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup d'état.
The United States denied all of its claims by refusing to extradite Gulen and recommending a change of tone.
The most recent statement by the representatives of the State Department was made on the occasion of Erdoğan ' s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he insists on his own and is also demanding other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union unless Brussels names the date on which visa restrictions for Turkish citizens are lifted," announced by the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Chelik, on 9 August.
According to him, Ankara ' s amendment of the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
Note that on August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words responded to the relevant statement of the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevluth Chavushoğlu.
A further provocative statement by Chavushoğlu was made last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it met with the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign States in the defence field - they import missiles," said Chavushoğlu in an interview with Anadolu.
He said that Turkey now needed to develop its own defence system based on its own technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have sought others," said the Minister.
The experts believe that this reflects Turkey ' s serious disagreement with the West and the country ' s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Studies, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is playing his game and cannot go into a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West from both a business and a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdoğan will try to balance while maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although it would certainly be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient man in this post," AIF.ru explained by an expert.
According to him, it is possible that, following statements by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for visa-free space with Europe, and the extradition of Gulen from the United States), he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him on humanitarian issues, on dictatorial management of the country, and so on," Minchenko says.
The head of the Political Information Centre, Alexei Muhin, concedes that the President of Turkey will change his point of view with Russia as soon as he benefits from it.
Eight months ago, Erdoğan took an extremely hard stand against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Between the two poles - the West and Russia - he will try to make the most of himself" says Muhin.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, which is precisely why he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus will be reached with Turkey," the expert believes.
This is not the view of the head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova.
Turkey ' s relations with both the EU and the US are now quite tense, primarily because of Erdoğan ' s own domestic policies.
I believe that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have stated that they are prepared to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, have settled relations with Israel, have engaged in active political engagement with Iran," Aif.ru Glazov explained that Erdoğan's next step would be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, Erdoğan ' s current policy is to return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions began.
"It was precisely then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relationship with the Middle East and the Asian region in the "zero problems with its neighbours."
The visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have been very successful.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and strengthen Turkey's position in both the regional and international arenas," the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, but the question now is whether the EU will respond firmly to Turkey, which can open borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Medical Strike: Calls for new collective protests
The junior doctors asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
The nurses and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members participating in the secret ballot.
In a letter to the members on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Helen McCort said that the government had continued to "stay silent" about the problems that she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "In view of the current situation, the JDC leader voted in favour of rejecting the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for formal re-negotiation on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, the leader of JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to endorse a continuous programme of expansion of collective protests, starting in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The BMA assistant physician leader, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after a vote to cancel the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to be accepted during the pre-vote meetings of 54,000 paramedics and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of the Bad?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to the gilded palace in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed tight, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own modest standards.
In contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has repeatedly referred to his "dear friend" Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the crisis was caused by the first thing he mentioned in his introductory comments: Turkey hit a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was violent.
Mr. Putin broke out with an angry tirade accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger from an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, State-controlled media carried out a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdoğan's own family had profited from the illegal oil trade from Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
At the end of the day, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin had received the apology he had asked for from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost deposed last month when he attempted a coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There's also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will, of course, feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're picking up the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, State television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists over there, tomatoes back here," as the report said in the Vedova newspaper.
But the visit also had added political value to Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West for considering it a weak response to a coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the turtle's speed of talk about joining the EU and Mr. Putin's move - which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.
Bear in mind, this is a gift for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described me as "alyans bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
Perhaps it is self-explanatory that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two Presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and considering the possibility of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey hit a Russian jet fighter aircraft - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC in Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has abandoned them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies were used by RBS to protect other brands of consumer credit.
It was supported by millions of pounds of international sports sponsorship, from the Six Nations Cup of Rugby to the Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller banking brands for individuals that will gain more influence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be engaged in because we are now becoming more brand bank."
As the bank became a global brand, the RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up a profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
"This is a good time for us to move the brand bank, because the basis (we asked ourselves) is how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were gonna be a great customer bank and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's a good time.
Frankie Dettori gets to 3,000 winners with a New Market win on the Adventure.
Dettori sprays champagne after a take in Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with his second winner of the night on his home path - the Adventure, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this remarkable mark in smooth jumps.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion of Dettori's jockeys, who had won the Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here, too.
I'm really glad it happened in Newmarket, because this is where I moved in 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unbelievable.
Dettori takes applause when he brings Predence after victory.
Two jockeys reached such a point in the race with obstacles: the champion of jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical makeup that distinguishes him from the others in the weight room.
He's a great race agent, his enthusiasm, and his charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd bring 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for the weekend and a big race!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners to the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British races, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this remarkable mark with a brand-new, fast slash from the horse.
From rapid finishes to rapid nipples, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth races for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
A lot of big race winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascott in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and remained in disbarment due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed a great power of will to challenge skeptics and return to uniform.
And he may not have finished for a while -- Dettori said earlier that he wanted to continue to compete at least until he was 50 years old.
Putin's firing the chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative of environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the president," but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov ' s deputy in 2012, Anton Wyno, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital, Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MIIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later served as the head of the Office of the President ' s and Cabinet ' s Protocol, reporting on the Kremlin ' s website (in Russian).
During his assignment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as Head of State in drafting laws and in monitoring how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be dismissed and recommended that Vino replace him.
Do smiles make sense?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on State television, both men stated that the Chief of Administration had resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it didn't convince anyone here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, this is the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement - that the man who was once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy - was met with great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, you might say, a difficult position, for four years.
Well, I guess I was the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russia's president after Putin's second term, because Putin's third term would be contrary to the constitution.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, took office.
Putin became Prime Minister until his return to the presidency three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with the producer.
Gibson was part of a fight at a show in L.A. last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint application.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences in filming and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be erased from the show that monitors the FBI's team of agents are expected to be received later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who previously played a leading role in Dharma and Greg's sitcom was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but now it's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and, above all, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
It is intended that the show will return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banff sought assistance in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks 75 fish could have been sandstones left behind by a waterstorm.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, put this show on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The 1.35 billion-pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern flight and Viaduct Queensferry Crossing, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four links between the painting winds that are now approaching completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 cents of bridge.
The 1.35 billion pounds project should now be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to the engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the link between the viaduct and the bridge painting is a virtual operation using extremely accurate assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of all the bridge paintings are now in place, and for the last section of the painting, concrete coatings are spilled at Roscae today, which means that all the paintings are ready for climbing to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said, "The first link on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this interface is the most modern construction art.
With the last section of the road and its connection to the expanding north pylon road, we were left to close the remaining gap on the north - or on the shore - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
It was a large and, at the same time, very graceful operation.
Large because the Viaduct weighs about 6,000 tonnes and should have been raised to an angle of about 3%.
Elegant, because the clearances the team was working on were tiny - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moelfre: Three men's 'lucky to live'
Three men were lucky enough to survive after they were thrown off a fishing boat in England.
Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfr.
Three men tried their best to swim to safety while their ship continued its journey.
"We saw their ship circling with them and assuming the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, the steering lifeboat.
"Thankfully, by the time we got down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found helpless and trapped in a buoy without a lifejacket.
All of them were taken aboard the shore lifeboat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed.
The boat engine had an emergency locker, but somehow he broke off from the man who operated the boat when it overturned.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, choosing to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go removes people from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and, more recently, smartphones.
It is so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the major passion of the Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (subsequently a series of cartoons, playing cards and other branches).
Like many other pop cultural events, all of this was no longer relevant a little before the new game became available in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was delayed due to a massive response that overburdened the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokemons that are tracked by GPS and, if found, can be 'shots' (through your phone screens) or 'captures'.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the holocaust by pulling away from the sofas to search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by a "normal" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people being tracked, who performed 30 minutes per day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing the Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on levels.
Many health campaigns that persuade people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not found a response, because most health messages are boring and are spoken by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she takes people out to do what they love.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends hunting.
As usual, there are boring assholes looking for something to complain about.
And, yeah, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
'Cause even though smartphone apps like Fitbit may have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us any reason to do what this game does.
Newcomer's gonna sit down, and use will weaken over time.
However, with the success of the Pokemon, there will be more games that combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Byles wins the gold of the absolute championship in female gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Byles is invulnerable for all of this.
Dynamite on the back jump.
Uncoerced on a log.
Shocking on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast went up to the absolute championship title on Thursday, placing the gap between itself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the scrutiny of the Olympics.
Her overall score was 62,198 at a reasonable distance from the silver medalist and teammate of the Final Five, Eli Riceman, and Russian bronze medalist Alia Mustafaina.
Byles, from the United States, competes in the gymnastic log during the final of the women ' s individual absolute art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of absolute championship and fifth in general, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she showed her final score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Byles has spent the last three years dominated by his sport, winning 15 medals of the World Championship - including 10 gold medals - with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and accuracy that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between the Bayles and the others in the field as between her and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be regarded as an unjustified expectation.
Simone Byles of the United States, on the left, and Ali Riceman, on the left, are hugged after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the women ' s individual absolute gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Byles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the retirement party of Marta Karoli's National Team Coordinator.
While Bayles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, it is not quite true.
Part of her free exercise program, the one that includes her signature passage, is built on Latin American music that would fit right up like a house on the street outside of the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, as a child starting to walk and as coach Aimee Boorman's open mother when she visited the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single absolute championship since the summer of 2013 - a streak of luck that should last as long as Bailes wants.
Although Mustafa gained a small advantage with two rotations, it was a mirage.
The gymnastic log and free exercise - where the Bayles defends the world championship - are ambushed.
She went forward again with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Riceman hugged her softly while they were waiting for the final account - a clean formality - and tears appeared around a shiny red with white and blue eye pads for the Beiles when the design she had once recorded in the clipping album came true.
Riceman's speech was a little revenge for what happened four years ago, when she divided the third place, but lost the bronze of Mustafa's on a time-breaker.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of a team that Americans call "Grandma" was much ahead of us.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered in return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
As for the Bayles, the viral tweet of 19 years old from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the most deadly attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lainer, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on 12 June when their car was parked on the carriageway, said the authorities.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight rounds from a pistol standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he fled in another vehicle, the report states.
The police claim that the triple murder does not appear to be the result of the robbery, since the perpetrator did not take the wallets or $2,900 that were held by an adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted the investigators to verify that he had not been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American regions for four months.
"This is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a branch of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence which led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lainer, 31 years old, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pick-up truck half an hour before the triple murder and which was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The investigators found the casings and removed the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old baby with a microcephalus: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mom.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephalus is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which isn't really true - of course you're signing up for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that anymore," Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth is showing the gesture Edmund made for "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalus can arise from a variety of different circumstances: genetic infections, such as in Edmund, during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeke.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Pixivto remembers the emotional loss of the uncertain future.
Did I always say what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime prognosis because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know things are gonna get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flood, cause rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Many rivers in south-east Louisiana and south Mississippi have emerged from the coast and are threatened by large-scale flooding following extreme rainfall, as reported by the National Meteorological Service.
Governor John Bell Edwards of Louisiana stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor ' s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were being made for high-water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said it was only the arrival of Tangjipahoa that requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
Meteor said in a statement that an extra 3 to 5 inches could be in the area.
In southern Alabama, waiting for the flood was on duty until Friday, as it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Amit River near Den Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a flood level record during the past weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could have flooded many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood that flows downstream in the parish of Assenchen was a threat, as these inflated rivers would flow slowly into Lake Morpa.
The Ticfo River, just south of Mississippi State in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday morning.
Squads were still pulling people out of the flood in Aimeet and Wilkinson counties in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that Beaver Creek's waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, quickly rose overnight.
He said that another stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the largest tributary she'd seen in 48 years that she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where they were sheltering on Friday.
Krautmann says that the flood is "swiftly spreading," as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says that an observer near Livingstone reported a rainfall of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was oversaturated by rainfall from the surrounding environment.
The heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from homes in the parish of Tangjipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that counselor Tangjipahoa described 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both being flooded.
The chairman of the parish, Robbie Miller, said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to receive those who had been evacuated.
"They'll be able to go home as soon as the water starts to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, the parish of Tangjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said the city manager, Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, reported that the covert rain continued on the Gulf coast of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Tawson, the manager of Shopper Value Foods in Aimeet, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Tawson said, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut by bullets," remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting in a 6-year-old town this week.
His grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa said Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He got a lot of it, his little body was filled with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade in the local elementary school.
Brown was one of the four people shot in the Germanttown district.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot dead in the front seat of the car near the 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been shot.
Investigators report to the Philadelphia CBS that there appears to have been an exchange of fire between several armed men.
The semi-automatic weapon casings attached to different semi-automatic weapons were used.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the side of the sidewalk.
Thus, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the exchange of fire," reported the station by Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi of Philadelphia.
Many houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly looking at the security cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday, playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team and for a few reasons.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And two, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simona Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Ali Riceman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American presence of women at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, female gymnast number one has been an African-American woman.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
The world could now witness the incredible performances of the three-time World Championship Simona Bayles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected, yet virtual gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in a woman's individual absolute championship.
And Ali Riceman's teammate made some silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnastics all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the final five because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli's training.
But in reality gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnasts are first trained at private gymnastics clubs supported by parents paying tuition fees, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnasts' families.
Aimee Burman, Coach Simone Byles, and Maggie Hani, Coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for the communities of the countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban young people (mainly black and Latin American) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my home city, to provide a high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a positive life-long impact on good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls into gymnastics, and that's great.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a great time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this serious demonstration of the "Women's Force" to win team Olympic gold and to motivate so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The junior doctors took up the call for further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected.
Ministers had hoped to conclude the change dispute by agreeing to the amended contract with the British Medical Association leaders, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, saying that NHS was on "no land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in night work and weekends to improve services outside the working hours.
Dr. Helen McCott, chairman of the young doctors' committee," BMA said in a statement last night: "The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will feed the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute was met with reluctance to act and sometimes with complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction, and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not do so, then the junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to organize further strikes.
The last round at the end of April delayed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were engaged to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better weekend payment for 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "The strikes do little or nothing, but they exert pressure on already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Junior Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Workers had hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics - staff distribution, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - had been a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the terms of the WMA in November, February and May.
A 2-dollar drug per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a 2-dollar-a-day drug after the authorities recommend giving it to more people and for a longer time.
Anti-plotting tkeggerlore reduces the risk of repeated seizures for people with heart problems.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
NICE's National Health Service has advised that it should be given to people for four years to prevent the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service has now advised that it should be given to people for four years to prevent the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people in England have a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them have another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the flow of blood and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already been caught in one attack are at greater risk of receiving another.
The Ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, a British firm sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of tkeggerlore for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said, "Despite effective secondary prevention practices with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that tkeggerlore, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Pre-advising tkegrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the Tigerlore - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that period.
The culture of PC ownership has allowed the falsification of votes in Muslim areas to flourish.
Ex-Mayor Tower-Hamlettes Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year because of corruption, following a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes, which has resulted in widespread falsification of votes in Muslim communities, according to the destructive government report released today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former cabinet minister, is critical of the police, election observers and city authorities for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of "excessive sensitivity to race and religion."
The former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that the police needed to be allowed to put cordons outside the polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For the time being, voters should simply state their name and address.
The report even suggests that permanent ink be placed on people ' s fingers when they deliver their ballots, so that no one can vote twice.
We need to give better protection to the informants, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access by the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"It's not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street as a result of a voting scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office because of a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had cynically distorted the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to have "run his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were in doubt or the result of being a person, when a person votes, pretending to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the mail fraud in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their choice of candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: "There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were fears that... public institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of the excessive sensitivity of "political correctness" over ethnicity and religion."
Eric's cheese made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from the ballot papers to stop the "vote harvest."
The report before Theresa May also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent the use of the voters list for immigration fraud and privilege.
Consideration is being given to requiring voters to present their identity before voting.
Use permanent ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot papers to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of people ' s nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Dismiss political campaigners and activists from working with mailboxes and envelopes.
To give the police the power to place cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for individuals to be charged with intimidation under the submission of the People ' s Act 1983.
Take illegal photographs at polling stations.
Require that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, claiming that it is "exciting" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts," he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for ticks" of the electoral registration offices of the city administrations.
Sir Eric stated: "The last court order in Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of the parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some bodies threatens this good reputation.
Cate and other celebrities of the Rio Olympics.
The 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about a French cyclist, Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be an impressive Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics player is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people who appear on our screens at this point in time, Fow made a list of Olympics with more than a superficial resemblance to the Gollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: A member of the U.S. male archer team, Brady Allison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double on the cycle track, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio's superstar.
A member of the U.S. male archer team, Brady Allison, caused a hurricane on Twitter after the images appeared of him, who looked frighteningly similar to the Wallstreet Wolf star.
And in fact, the archer found out about social media madness and admitted he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I don't personally see a great resemblance, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt indicate even more this year: the striking similarity between the British jumper Greg Raserford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Aliya Mustafa, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg, they've been comparing it to the star Hora Matthew Morrison for years.
Turning to the more unexpected, this user thinks that Nathan is the "sport version" of the actor Starta.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who could boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Yulia Yefimov, can boast not only of the same tan skin and blonde hair as actress Anna Linn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the US team, according to fans, resembles "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte."
Hard women: Hope Solo football star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same shapes of face and eye
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this couple.
A Twitter user recently approached the site to announce his admiration that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the star of U.S. football and actress Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of their faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to Laura Linnie's identical smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which is like Gabriel Union's Smile.
Olympic commentator at the CBC apologizes for speaking of a Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron McDonald's analysis of the fourth place on the 14-year-old Ai Yanhane's 4-200-metre freestyle women's relay was ripped off by CBC viewers in live coverage of the Olympics.
The Canadian broadcasting company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started up like a stink" and "dead like a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay 4x200 m freestyle.
You could've heard McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC comment team to "dilute it in color," say, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ay Yanhan, aged 14, sailed the second stage of the 1:57.79 relay race - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to clear the gap from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC talker just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "dead like a pig"???"??
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan of China, in the final of the women's 4-200 m freestyle relay, said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter criticism immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many calling for him to be fired.
Twitter users couldn't resist hearing how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who was broadcasting the CBC, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the fact that the comment on the swim performance is on the air.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.
IFOR concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of comment, Scott Russell, had to apologize on behalf of McDonald.
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The TV too hastened to apologise and issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our audience live and our subscribers on social media.
Let us be clear, Byron's comments referred to the speech of a swimmer, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on an individual.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on the CBC Olympics.
'I was talking about a swimmer's performance, not her in person.'
'It goes without saying that no disrespect was implied, and I'm sorry.'
Primark's buyer insulted a woman who was brazenly trying on underwear in the middle of a store.
Buyers didn't know where to take a look when some woman went naked to try on her panties on the floor with the shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping store in Folkston.
Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkston, where the woman tried on the tricket panties before putting them back on the shelf.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said that after she had put on her underwear, the mystery woman was again "dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties off the window, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
"She wasn't trying to find a shelter somewhere to do it, she was just standing there shamelessly."
"Everybody stared when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to the other three couples before she finally decided there was nothing she liked, dressed up again and went out.
"It doesn't seem like she cared about who was watching her, or that she thought about the man who would eventually buy these underwear she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home underwear that someone else has already worn and they haven't been washed."
The accident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I'm concluding that the staff apparently tried to get these clothes out of the market after she left - much better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find out that another woman wore and took them off, and they weren't washed."
The representative of Primark reported: "Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our shop in Folkston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the goods in question had been removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from assault with a gun using a crav-maga
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misrachi, the master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they approach you from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Misrachi, the first thing to do is turn around and you see the attacker and "free the fire line."
Then you squeeze the gun firmly between your forearm and your shoulder before you punch them in the face with your free elbow.
Then you follow the knee in the groin, and while the assailant is bent from pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, you hit him in the face with a gun, and you walk back with the gun pointed at him.
For an armed man in the front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly seize the gun and twist it so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, and then turn the gun out of his grip before going back and aiming at him.
Does that sound hard?
Look at the video to see how Misrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a Crav Maga Master -- is to give away your cash.
For a travel guide, Jan Wright runs his tongue through Europe's most dirty places.
The British traveler put his immune system and vomit reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The lead and author of travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, conducted the euro banknotes, the circus Piccadili railings, the toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a movie called the "Lizun Traveler's Guide to Internal Force," has produced some amazing results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Wright spoke to doctors and health workers throughout Europe about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing from the licked one brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his bowel, traveling around the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railing at the train station to the toilet flush button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system
In the film he made, he said, "I've been completely carefree of my health since I was a kid, and I've been pulling a lot of stuff into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer greater than 4,000 units.
By comparison, just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer value was over 4,000 units, while the hands just washed showed less than 60.
Wright and a Finnish dairy producer, Valio, made a movie about a traveller entitled "The Guide of the Lisun Traveler on Internal Power," which shows the number of bacteria in various places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, 'This is close to one of the worst things I've ever sniffed in the bathroom.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The "Lizun Traveler's Guide to Internal Force" was filmed with a Finnish dairy producer, Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio for snacks, juices, and new categories said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's just say I'd lose respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were rather tough.
I'm glad that some of these licks we've managed to film.
In a survey conducted in 2015 in Valio, 84 per cent of respondents associated acid bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestinal conditions, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added acid bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, the city house of Cornwall, on the eve of the eviction.
The family of hooligans left their municipal home with a loss of $50,000 after they were evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they had been forcibly evicted from the property, shocking housing cooperative officials found the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were opened, the trash was spread across the floor and the walls were dirty with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, a settlementr at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be saved.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things that need to be weighed, because this real estate object is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and a bad name.
The couple had three sons who had lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and the police reported that the reign of fear caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents in nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, controversy and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In a few rooms, a house that could be demolished, they found old trash.
The floorboards in the house where the drugs were sold in the past were removed.
Neighbors say they saw a fight on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from her home this week after having been granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by the neighbours, who said that their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, 'They weren't worried about anyone.'
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the leader of the Cornwall Housing neighbourhood group, said that the family had been unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police.
Garbage and old toys were scattered down the bushy side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a shame the tenant couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been horrifying to its observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police, and the members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done bravely to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said that they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms after eviction
The settlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage surrounding the house.
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as scales corresponding to the items and 1,700 £ cash.
Skeldon was fined after he pleaded guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She claimed that the money was to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were rendered homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they'll try to evict tenants who aren't subject to rent rules.
Angela Crowe of Devon and Cornwall Police said that the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'It's a message to those who feel that they can behave without being charged by the prosecutor, as well as by those who are harmed by such behaviour', she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to drowsy on the sun were scared for their lives.
The plane P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that it had conducted a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is the moment when scared tourists start panicking, while the moment when a low-flying plane spoke over a crowded beach.
The dramatic frame shows a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from the sand strip hunters in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned by the noise of the aircraft's engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aveira in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few resters who posted a video of a shocking flight on social media, said, "He flew very low twice, and there was a moment that at some point it seemed like he was going to crash."
Nuno Arroza added, "I was surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on Aveira beach were horrified when the plane showed up from fog and flew at extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft had conducted a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and had to lower himself so low, as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot stated that the flight was slightly lower than usual owing to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and also claimed the lives of four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances such as thick fog and smog from forest fires, which worsened visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was instructed to locate fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been compulsory for more than a year, but most restaurants and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are increasing, and the business is facing fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For over a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for producers and carriers to use food, as well as food companies in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Rosbranadzor's inspections of compliance with these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But for the time being, officials only issue fines for certain breaches of the regulations (see List of Documents...).
Failure to comply with the regulations would generally cost the enterprise 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
HASP was conceived in the United States in the 1960s as a system that takes into account and prevents food risks.
It was about the safety of the astronauts' food.
Today, the system is used in all food industries, not only in the US, but also in Canada and the EU.
Since February 2015, HASP has been operating in the territory of TC.
The development and implementation of the system was four years old for businesses (the HASSP requirement was introduced in the TC regulation in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm concerns only food production and not restaurants, " explained the head of the Public Council, Elena Ceretele.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August and early September.
But they're not gonna call for an agitating demand, because their target audience, families with children, is already preparing for school, and experts point out.
The Travel Agency Alliance sent a letter to the government yesterday requesting that charterers be allowed now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of a quality and affordable sea vacation is not resolved, as most of the accommodation facilities have already been booked until the end of September at Krasnodar Krai and Crimea resorts," the authors note and stress that the opening of charter services in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian maritime tourism products.
According to the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of the Tour Industry (RST), if the Russian and Turkish aviation authorities quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed, as yet, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly construct programs and negotiate with airlines on the right side of the ship," says Pavel Rumiantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible renewal of charterers was good news, but would not affect market power too much, because the major charter-trackers - families with children - had already returned from their vacations and were preparing for school or were on vacation in other countries.
During the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travellers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who can rest spontaneously," says Paul of Rumjants.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now offers a very budgetary offer of 50,000 to 60,000 rubles for a two-way tour because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, Director General of Opto-Travel.
Otherwise, you can't count on it - the bulk of the travel has already been planned.
Paul Rumjantsov also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charterers will also be called upon, but we should not wait.
"For Turkey, the launching of charters is now a rehearsal of the next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Charter opening to Turkey is positive news for the next season," Valery Rubtsov agrees.
The Tax Code exempts NDFL from statutory compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for damage caused by injury or other injury to health.
Article 222 of the Labour Code provides for the issuance of milk to workers engaged in hazardous work.
The rules and conditions of extradition themselves are laid down in the Order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free distribution of milk or other equivalent food is made to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to harmful working factors.
On the basis of these rules, the Russian Federation, in the letter under consideration, concluded that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, income from the value of milk given to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions is exempt from the taxation of NDFL in accordance with the rules and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation of 16 February 2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gazstroybank was left without a licence from the CB.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew its licence to carry out banking operations from the Affiliated Commercial Bank (GASSTROBANK) registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GASSTRABANC AO had a high-risk credit policy for placing money in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and reliable disclosure of the value of the bank ' s assets have given the credit organization a basis for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
The bank has an interim administration until the date of appointment to the competition manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended under federal laws.
GASSSTRUBANC is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ "On the insurance of the deposits of natural persons in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided for at the rate of 100 per cent of the balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
Payments according to the Deposit Insurance Agency will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the records, as of 1 August 2016, GASSTROBANK's AO's assets were 335 in the Russian banking system.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS died in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Counsel Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqqah, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqah, a stronghold of a group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all this - a tombstone and a will to others - is that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - to convince people to make the same choice at any time," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said that she had married an ISIS militant in Syria and had been widowed for several months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the position of Chief Justice if elected
The leader of Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, says he is convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate's Republicans blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid stated at the conference call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
The representative of Reed later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether or not she would put out Garland, and she had simply made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reid stated that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the henchmen and supporters of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for the job.
Treaties claims that erotic calendars for 'women, just like men'
Treaty magazine works with photographer David Bellmer to produce a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude museums.
Treasury President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's up, too.
"We need to get back to showing the eternal and classic naked figure where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can send photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moskwichs will be given a memo about bad Internet stores.
In Moscow, they're going to issue a memo that will tell us how not to be a victim of an Internet store.
It was reported in Rosbradzor, writing M24.
The agency ' s specialists are reported to be preparing a note that will help citizens to select an Internet store properly and identify possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
This will be the background and legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will contain recommendations on how to properly compile the claim and so on," described in Rosbradzor.
The memo is being finalized to date.
It will subsequently be posted on the Rosbradzor website in Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and distribute to Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in which it gave the name of the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Persons of Ukrainian and Russian nationality who had assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts had been detained.
These include Panov, Evgeny Alexandrovich, and Zachtei, Andrei Romanovich.
"All of them confess," the report says.
Evgeny Panov, a Zaporizh region resident, who had been detained on suspicion of having organized terrorist attacks in Crimea, had previously pleaded guilty to interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google with 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) imposed an administrative fine of 438 million roubles on Google Corporation, as stated on the Department's website.
"The penalty for Google was 438 million roubles for breach of competition law.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fine soon," said FAS Deputy Chief Alexei Docenko.
In the course of the investigation, FAS found that Google supplied smartphone manufacturers sold in Russia with a Google Play application store only if other applications were installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search engine, which should be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the Act "On the protection of competition" (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that compliance will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will benefit our consumers.
The Law "On the Protection of Competition" should be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including," noted the head of the Department of Communications and Information Technology of the Russian Federation, Elena Zayev.
The office is suspected of colluding 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network has been fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The New Bookstores network has been fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," reports Moscow City News Agency.
According to Rosbranadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be regarded as "provocating or inciting to the suicide of children and adolescents."
The Kosovo District Court confirmed the violation of the prescribed requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered a fine of 49 copies of the printed material seized by the Rosbradzor Department.
The source at the New Book Office confirmed that it was a Stace Kramer work.
In March of this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest bookshops were being tested for the book "50 Days Before My Suicide."
There will be an evening in Moscow to commemorate Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, the sculptor Ernst unknown will be remembered, as TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August at the Central Literary House.
Unfortunately, not everyone can say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States personally.
So it was decided to have this evening for those who want to remember him on their home land," stated the Russian Jewish Congress at the press office.
It noted that this was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown are invited to the evening, including the poet Evgeny Evtushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the GMII, Pushkin Irina Antonov, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky, Head of the Moscow Culture Department, Alexander Kibowski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pechatnikov.
It was previously reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown planned to hold a sculptor memorial in New York, presumably before 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men like vinyl.
And until you started clogging the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym of Not All Alone Men Middle-Let, this allegation is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the rebirth of records under discussion is not due to a boom among a generation of two thousand people who want to penetrate a new material object, but rather to a nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between 45 and 54 years old, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of amateur gathering - it has an emotional value: older buyers of vinyl are slightly more likely to hold their feelings (56 per cent versus 53 per cent) and enjoy loneliness (69 per cent versus 66 per cent).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking down the center of the busy Soho Street, wearing a modest gray suit and hogging before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Well, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and dirt - hotels, cafes, Paperspace stores have now flooded buildings once occupied by independent vendors - several music stores with fantastic experts remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to the various people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional mood with observation.
The native of Glasgow Stewart, age 55, followed by Sister Ray (accounting for data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20), in London for half a day to meet, and going shopping to take hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, illustrated above (he e-mailed me a picture, I didn't chase him home), are coming through the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles comes in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they got out and buy things he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm buying is the late '60s, the early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are probably introverts that like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
It's my fault.
Wez, 25 years old, who works for Sister Ray, also thinks that many of the clients he meets match the profile of YouGov.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people under the influence of media noise, people who had heard about their return and felt obliged to buy back their old records.
According to the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among the Renaissance figures of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional importance of the records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wez, some of the older clients, in particular, are offended by the cash-free payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to go into the constant existence of familiar envelopes for records, objects that awaken memories of a quiet youth.
"I think sometimes it could be filling a void or possessing material things as a sort of calm," Wez says.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from a racket of records.
A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% had a player they never used, while 7% of those buying vinyl did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news coverage, I would probably look seriously puzzled by the rackage of Bosanov's compilations.
Johnny, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe (the count of data: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More part of the product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, they're a little under 20 who just get to know it.
Fopp, who just took the whole floor of the vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I get here.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less uncoerced than in the above-mentioned shops - the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation - it is a pleasure to see diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records available on the market.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much, she says, so collecting records isn't a very good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of the vinyl is " ... " - she's falling into dreams with a breath full of love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: City fashioners.
While I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at jeans-enhancing shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid cell every minute before my father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the Crossley player.
There's a ladder on the left, with a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one looks - perhaps because they're just jewelry, some are so high on the wall that it wouldn't be possible to touch them.
It's a real art vinyl.
But, given that any attention to these subjects can mean more money for the industry and send a few clients to the deep Soho for a while, very little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of its money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But as long as my findings show that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend Thursday morning walking around the record stores on Berwick Street, piercing records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenlandic polar shark - the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists claim that the Greenlandic polar shark has the highest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record placed the female between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
The French court rejects the offer to tear down shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the offer of the Kale authorities to destroy dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week ' s court hearing, the Calais authorities stated that the State should be able to dismantle a total of 72 home-made shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for a few euros in home-made restaurants.
The Prefect of Calais said that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free meals offered by a pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that homemaking shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those who need it.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who ran 72 home-made shops, but stated that the problems of the Kale prefecture had "been fully understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the spaces provided a calm meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the children ' s cafe, the Jungle Book at the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes and shelter counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under eight years of age."
Two charitable institutions, Relief to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, estimated that the number of people in Camp Jungle had increased to over 9,000 - the highest in history - following a dramatic increase in arrivals during the summer.
Neighborhood libraries invite young freemen to study programs.
This week, the Philadelphia libraries will hold meetings to celebrate City Day, the Year of the Russian Film and even the Day of the Physicalist.

Britain stops at the silver in rugby 7, after a master class in Fiji allows them to take gold.
The impressive episode of the United Kingdom in Regby 7 was devastatingly stopped at the final obstruction of Fiji's team in the finals on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has been given a master class in ball ownership, slapping, evasiveness, game support, running lines and brute force to win gold, their first Olympic medal of all colours.
The defeat came with not too poor silver comfort - Britain's third in a day - and they were proud of their efforts at the first Olympic tournament in Regby 7, where New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated along the way.
Bocks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, could return to have a negative impact on them in the finals.
But no matter what, Fiji won the best of 15 men in this form.
This may be some consolation for Britain - but probably not - that at least one Britishman will hang a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach, Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.
It was a trip for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Seven.
Here they only lost one.
These blows will hurt, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started great, for fun, beating up the UK's efforts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Collinisau dived into a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
The great attempt to intercept Mitchell kept the man-fire Leon Nakarawa from beating the third, but that only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption, and there were still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then burst through several other sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
Implementation resulted in a 29-0 break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby 7, while Britain still mastered the trade.
Which, to a large extent, is.
The United Kingdom was doing a massive half-game replacement, and they sealed the Fiji dam... for four minutes, which, according to the standards of the first half, was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game was long on the way to South Sea islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji ' s complete joy.
Mata William decorated Fiji's cake, which did not need to be decorated, with another attempt in the last few seconds.
There was a whistle, Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on a lawn completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and Britain slightly bypassed South Africa in the tense semi-finals of one attempt each - the difference between British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings the Bocks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great legwork, broke the line and knocked them under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother to 15 of England's team, Anthony, ensured victory - and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing fight of the coach with cancer.
There won't be any more exciting gold on these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy liftings in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the value of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three votes in this boat, Coach Robin Williams' echo was always as long as they wanted the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the annals of British sport who got to this height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated speech, once again unprecedented.
What we see is that two brilliant athletes sliding on the surface with the elegance of swans do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold row was a battalion of ready hands that contributed to gradually growing wins that were important, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see the day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could be a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your species a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky he could start treatment in early 2014 at the interseasonal level, keeping the schedule at a minimum if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking through the department - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said a few steps.
That's how it starts.
It's a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin, too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This couple sets up a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 metres, as New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We've been in phase a lot.
Helen called: "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get carried away right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for a good row to come out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so better," she said.
The Government extended the deadline for destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the period for the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited from being imported into Russia.
The order was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruit and dairy products were banned.
Food imported into the country by bypassing the embargo has been being disposed of in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were removed from sales.
Hunting "forbidden"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
There will be an atmospheric front across the capital region that will cause precipitation and lower air temperatures.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees of heat by day.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short - time rains, thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also projected in Orlov, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reporting to the "Days.ru."
It's unlikely that there will be a rain next week.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization ' s rules.
Import rates exceed Russia ' s commitments upon accession to WTO.
"This is the first time the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation," says the message on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "comprehensive."
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is mentioned in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US conduct in resolving disputes in the WTO undermined the organization's principles of discussion.
Similar statements were made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of Americans to confirm South Korean Judge Chan Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not turn to the WTO on the Western sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
The President ' s administration has been replaced by a leader
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Anton Vaino as the head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the administration of the President and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work that President Ivanov had begun to lead the administration to be important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, Izvestia wrote that the experts considered the resignation of Sergei Ivanov as the chief executive of the administration to be transparent and understandable and reshuffle would not fundamentally alter the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who has been in the Presidential administration for a long enough time, has effectively built up AP activities.
He was replaced by Deputy Chief of Administration Anton Vaino, a man who knows very well the specifics of this work.
In Poland, it is assumed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years ' time the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it because of its shift to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogslav Majez.
His words are passed on to TASS.
"Maybe we're not buying any gas (from Gazprom), we're diversifying our supply now.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be East, raw materials from the LNG terminals and Norway," said Mazetz.
Gazprom currently dominates the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had supplied almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the procurement of PGNIG increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent a year earlier.
It should be recalled that on 22 July, the Polish competition authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners in the construction of the northern flow 2 pipeline.
This month earlier, Poland left Gazprom's request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered to North Flow-2.
This was announced by the vice-chairman of the holding board, Alexander Medvedev.
The North Flow 2 auction will take place in 2017, and the auction is scheduled to take place in autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom was not yet planning to take any action on the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, stated the Deputy Chairman of the company's board, Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of the year Poles had only increased by 42 per cent the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The Vice-President of Gazprom added that the mere fact that the Polish PGNIG had filed an application with the Stockholm arbitral tribunal did not yet mean that the negotiations had ceased.
The Polish company had previously applied to the judicial authority to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
To recall, Peter Naimsky, Commissioner of the Polish Government for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Commissioner of the Polish Government for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could no longer supply blue fuel from the east after six years.
According to him, Warsaw is planning to build a new liquefied natural gas terminal, Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The North Flow 2 provides for the construction of two sea gas pipelines with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hugh, the first SMM subheadings in Ukraine.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, in response to the question posed by the journalists, that the RIA News.
According to OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored the situation at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport, which went 400 metres from the runway to the left wing.
Video footage has been released by 360.
The emergency took place at 4.30 Moscow time.
Krasavia flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was being transported to the parking lot.
The Ufs airport works normally.
The JRC ' s Volga Transport Investigation Department has been investigating the reason for the severe landing of the aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict denied the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Steffan de Mistura, considered that what had happened was undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which are scheduled to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
United Nations experts have initiated investigations into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on an attack with toxic gas, suspected chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then claimed that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft had dropped bombs containing poison, but in Moscow the charges had been described as an attack.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakyat Nur al-Din al-Zinqi of what had happened.
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, started to burn my eyes, became hard to breathe," quotes the publication of the eyewitness's word.
At least seven people were killed in the attack and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists: "There is much evidence that this has really happened."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is specified in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the denial by all parties to the Syrian conflict of the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition."
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the daily shelling of its areas and the obstruction by terrorists of the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in hostilities.
The current regime of the organization's three-hour daily silence is considered "not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistoura's Humanitarian Adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required every week to deliver aid to the city and to evacuate the sick and wounded.
"We have to send bulk cargoes from the convoy trucks to an area where roads have been virtually destroyed and those left behind are mined," said Mr. Egeland. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
As Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced on 11 August the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will be in effect daily from Thursday.
The establishment of humanitarian windows is designed to enable the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation is taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow to halt the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiating process.
A series of explosions at Thailand's resorts resulted in the death of four people.
Several explosions immediately erupted in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed in the attack and 19 were wounded.
The epicentre of the explosions came to Hua-Hin.
Ten foreigners, four nationals and no Russians were among the victims.
None of the terrorist groups have yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has been hasty to state that Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of bombing.
According to preliminary information from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leading the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phuket area and the town of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta took power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been apprehended, as reported by police colonel Chrisana Patanacharoeen.
It was too early to speak of goals, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs was "relied that they were not linked to international extremist groups."
It's too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoyen said.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact they are local sabotages, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to Police General Sithichai Srisopachareenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets, filled with restaurants full of tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, there are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and an Austrian national.
Russians aren't among the victims of the bombings, reported by Rostourism's press service.
Local experts also linked the bombings to the 7 August referendum, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-making commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the country ' s Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
We will recall that on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Army Commander of the country, Prauta Chan-Ocha.
This move, he said, was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military had established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and dispersed the upper house of Parliament.
How Bangkok came to be in a state of emergency
The Government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions hit 28 people in the centre of Bangkok, five of whom were in critical condition, at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place.
Unidentified motorcyclists made the blasts.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Dry Log, the terms and conditions began to be developed.
According to JT, the Government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Dry Logg gold mine with two key restrictions.
It is proposed that the auction should not allow a company with 25 per cent or more of the foreign-owned company and those with no capital of at least 25 per cent of the State.
The industry does not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction may be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the Government a draft regulation and terms of auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk Region, 130 million ounces of reserves and resources), and has described two sources of "L" familiar with the situation.
The draft is presented on Wednesday evening, and one of them will be clarified.
In the Ministry of Nature, I confirmed that the project had been submitted to the Government.
The representative of Vice Prime Minister Alexander Chloponin, who was responsible for non-draining, said "I" that the project had not yet arrived in the office of the official.
"The auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the issuance of the government order, and given the deadline for the collection of potential bidders (at least 45 days) the tender may take place as early as October," says the Ministry of Nature.
According to JS, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as described in the version that was sent to the ministries and FOIVs for agreement in July (some of them JS).
The first is the presence of at least 25% of State participation in the capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investing in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft, FZ, as already wrote by JO on 2 August, may prevent companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Dry Log is federally important (over 50 tons of gold reserves).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "restricted the admission of foreign companies" but refused to comment on the details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for public participation in the auction was put forward by the Irkutsk region, in December 2015 by the Ministry of Nature, and later confirmed by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroshchenko, "with investment agreements with Rosteh."
Those who lobby for a restriction on the admission of foreigners do not "J" specify.
"But it's in the spirit of time: not to give control to Russia's largest gold field against the background of Western sanctions," says the "J" who knows about the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, stated on 1 August that foreigners "may enter a consortium" if the applicants involve them "as a financial entity, as technology partners."
I interviewees find it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The largest gold miner in the Russian Federation, Polius, controlled by the son of Suleyman Kerimov Said and Rosteha, is considered to be the main contender in the Dry Log industry.
According to J, in July the partners created SL Goldo, where Polius had 51% of the shares, the Rosteha structure of RT-GR had 49%.
In Rostech, they rejected comments, in Polucus, they said that they were "indubitably interested in the asset" and had all the necessary competence and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the terms," added in Polius.
The ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the Russian government's decision was said by the sources "J."
The possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Log was claimed by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold are not interested in the asset, according to J.
In December 2015, the head of the Russian Federation's Gold Industry Union, Sergei Kashoub, estimated an investment of $2.5 billion to $4 billion in Dry Log.
Most potential applicants discourage not only the level of investment, but also the complexity of the project: the need for serious pre-exploration of stocks and technology to deal with complex ores is explained by the industry's "L" interlocutors.
In the pension market, the largest M&A deal, China Finance Pension Administrator, launched the process of merging the four NPFs under control.
As a result, the Gazfund-based Pension Savings will create an NPF with savings of about 373 billion roubles.
The launch of the process of merging four pension funds - China Finance, Promagrofund, Legacy and Gazfond Pension Savings - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of China Finance Pension Administrator's funds.
"Reorganization shall be carried out in consultation with the CB, subject to the requirement that the terms of the existing contracts shall not be impaired," as stated in the company's communication.
The association is based on the Pension Savings Fund.
As the CEO of the NPF, Oleg Bialoshitsky, points out, the pooling of funds addresses several challenges: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, disseminating the best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the target date for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the integration of the NPF, Gazfund Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As at 31 March, the pension savings of the combined funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts on the Fund's website, the beneficiaries of the Fund's owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (with 65 per cent control of the Fund) and Gazfund's NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched competitors much later.
For example, NPF Future's O1 control group "Future" swallowed up the "Stalfond" early this year.
The joint NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard Foundations.
"Association into a single structure, in addition to cost reduction, is necessary to meet structural challenges," notes NPF CEO "Future" Nikolai Sidorov.
Active efforts to consolidate funds have also been under way since April in the Safmar pension group - NPF "European," "Education and Science" and "Regionfonde" - to join the Safmar NPF before the end of this year.
They will be joined by the Trust NPF in 2017.
"Funding will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, transaction processes and costs," noted the Safmar retirement group.
Experts point out several reasons for the pause in the fund merger that China Finance Pension Administrator has endured.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively deployed.
Since the amendment of the CB regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers meeting the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by a major player," says Yuri Nogin, Director of the Financial Institutes Ratings Group ACARA.
Several NPF top 15 asset managers call the division of power and, as a result, staff assignments in a single fund, which were to be agreed by the group owners, another possible cause of pause.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comment.
Also, GPF Gazfond did not respond to the request for IP.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and costly exercise, it will be justified at a long distance.
According to Sergei Okolesnov, the CEO of Pension Partner, the Pension Fund has fewer outflows, accession will stabilize the group's other funds.
This will draw on the more successful experience of KIT Finance and the Promagrofund NPF in the construction of TPS retail sales, as well as the use of more modern software.
The CB's requirements for NPF processes and personnel are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, as Paul Mitrofanov, Corporate Rating Manager of Expert RA.
"The effect of the reduction of overlapping functions will certainly overwhelm the possible costs of consolidation," noted Mr. Mitrophanov.
The cost of merging the four funds of Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at 30-50 million roubles.
"The cost of four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles a year, with the consolidation of the budget in the medium term effectively halved," I am sure, Mr. Okolesnov.
The best Disney movie in Russia, Pete and his dragon, was released.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the benevolent dragon, the heartbreaking story, and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again.
A scared little boy picked up a dragon who became a human babysitter and a gentle nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy in a book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he's grown up and he's in a swamp bandage, and he can't be distinguished from another smart forest scum, Maugli.
In this form, Pete discovers a redheaded woman, Greys (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's Brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively drives the forest.
Now she's not only gonna have to believe that there's a dragon, she's gonna have to help save it.
Pete is taking an accelerated "human" course surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, moral code in their heart, and smile more dazzling than any commercial.
No character looks and acts too terrible for the audience to really hate or be afraid of.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an unusual forester under his control, is far from being an incorrigible villain.
A huge fuzzy dragon also turned out to be not scary, with the good face of a bulldog, the airline size of the wing, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, purring, even grunting and, fortunately, not saying, but always wanting to iron it, which is a very different thing from all known cinematographic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and manner of sticking together provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that, in the most tense moments, they begin to cry desperately into three streams not only of small viewers but also of adults.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, breaking up between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtualizes a canonic grandfather that every child would be happy to have.
How did the director David Lowry manage to make a fantasticly cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film "The Dragon Pete," mediocre from the nose to the tip of the tail, and remembering only a mix of animation and a game movie, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
It wasn't only a miracle that helped.
In fact, Lowry's original painting took only two things: Pete's orphan and the dragon.
Musical numbers and most of the weird jokes were left behind.
This fairy tale reads features taken from Bambi, the alien, and many other sweet children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the 21st century high-quality remake gallery.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon aren't as stunningly beautiful as the book of the jungle, and there's no masterful villain like Kate Blanchett as a stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney tradition.
By the way, Disney's director Lowry will get the keys to the magic castle again for the art film adaptation of Pieter Pan's story.

RBC journalist Alexandra Sokolov will be charged with a new charge
The lawyers of RNK journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing extremist activities, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found shortcomings in their client ' s case.
We learned from investigators just yesterday that the D.A. had made such a presentation.
We were scheduled to attend a hearing on the limitation of access to the criminal case file, but the hearing did not take place, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office," RRTK quoted counsel Olga Dinze.
She explained that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had pointed out to the investigators that there was a discrepancy between the qualifications of the case and the materials collected.
The investigators will now have to fill the gaps in the evidence base and charge Alexander Sokolov with a new charge.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (PC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, to clarify Ms. Dinze.
According to I, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from the charge the RSF journalist had been accused of "disturbing the political environment towards instability" and "extinguishing power illegally."
ALEXANDR ZILBERT, a reporter of the Commersant & Boscosport, spent his life in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian team's home, ate lunch in the local cafeteria and even passed the WADA test.
I don't think life's gonna stop here for a second.
Even at night.
The last start sometimes ends at midnight, after which athletes need an hour and a half or two more to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, settlement and eviction from the village continue unabated, as some athletes finish their speeches and leave Brazil, while others only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are reaching out to one of the temporary shadows.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, says Igor Kazikov, head of the Russian Olympic team sports delegation. " Despite the fact that the house where our model house was located, consider it model, was put into operation by one of the first, and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it, there's some trouble.
Hot water problems, so, sorry, toilet problems.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then they started coming in, but they just sniffed some stuff on the floor, that's all.
They've got floors, you see, some kind of innovative.
Like, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors are ordinary laminate!
Anyway, they got a change of company, and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side by mountains, and on the other, by the impressive ditches of water.
And for safety, there's still a two-metre-long steel fence all over the perimeter, along which the automatics walk.
In total, up to 17,000 people may be accommodated in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18-story buildings has a huge Russian flag - this house has been completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
When you look at a small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems seem to be the most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two ads on the registration counter: the printed "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and the hand of "I'll take the badges as a gift.
The bar itself drowns in the booklets.
Their funny colour contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "A reminder of infectious diseases for those travelling to Rio de Janeiro," "First aid in drowning, ingestion of the foreign body, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation," "First aid in burns, heat shocks, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent healing.
However, not everyone will have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in Russia that is ready to provide qualified help to the residents of the house at any time, including a relaxing and sports massage.
On the contrary, the health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "No matter what, we're gonna win!"
And, of course, poetry:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia don't back down, it won't break!
And to raise the spirit even more, there's this ad: "Dear brothers and sisters!
According to the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Rusi Kirill, the spiritual care of the Russian Olympic team's athletes is exercised by the protoier Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseyev.
You can order a prayer and other calls on the phone...
In general, there is a Centre for meditation and religious rites for all faiths in the village.
The Russians, in a privileged position, have their own chapel.
Because of the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to climb the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the dark, he tripped over the bodies on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new clinic company.
I guess they're ready to throw themselves at innovative floors at any moment, so they've decided to have a quiet hour right on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was expecting a meeting with an old friend, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our Batutists, who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his student, the champion of Europe, Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
There's nothing to complain about, but the impressions of the well-deserved trainer of Russia are shared.
It's one-on-four, but it's spacious.
The cupboard, of course, is ridiculous, out of fabric, not credible, but something can be put down.
"No, you pretend they're out of tea!" by the hand of the tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsov, who met me in the main dining room.
It is known at least because it is a space of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
They give out 60,000 meals a day, free of charge.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil," "Cooks of the World," "Asian food" and "Pizza, pasta."
The last option, as I pegged, is very popular with our volleyballists.
I didn't find soups in any of the gigantic restaurant units.
" What kind of soup? ' he wonders.
It's a good thing I brought Chinese with me.
And a kettle.
But in fact, just so you know, we have worse food on the court.
There's at least one thing you can choose, despite the insufferable uniformity.
I personally picked a pair of cracks and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Close to each dish is a sign with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, indicating the food value of the product and the presence of allergens.
Well, it was quite, I'd say, edible.
I don't even know why this line is worth all the time in the local McDonald's.
The fed, relaxed, you can say "hot" athletes outside the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure the victorina, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoking, you might say!
To get a present, you have to answer at least eight questions out of ten correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - A girl from WADA attacked me.
But she attacked the wrong guy.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic impulse, naturally.
The situation has already worsened on the second question: "If I have been notified of the doping control, do I have to go to the doping control point immediately?"
I've been going on option B, "No, I've got one hour."
Lost his guard, so to speak.
I forgot that WADA wasn't supposed to give you a break.
Anyway, you have to report immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I found it difficult to maintain a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I'm having difficulty!), I could use bioaddition to get "additional nutrients to increase my productivity."
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is formulated in a way that categorically does not prohibit, but strongly rejects, in several sentences.
It's not fair that WADA plays it!
What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go behind Yefimov, Isinbayev, and our whole bloody team.
That's why I'm focused, and I won a bad T-shirt out of the blue.
Know ours as they say!
In a winning mood, I went to the fitness center next door.
I'm into counting gyms.
Got lost to 250.
Surprised to note that no Russian sportsman was found in this pile of runways.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let someone who can't play train!
And here's our guy sitting in a nearby clinic.
In line for the oculist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
At the health centre, however, there is a condom-issuing machine all over the village.
And there is therein an exhilarating cry: "Remember with the cathedral."
The only thing left to do is spin a iron that resembles a doorlock pen and a condom made of Amazonian natural latex is readily falling out of the machine.
I took one for my memory.
Athletes will never get away with it. They got 450,000.
It is precisely for the celebration and celebration that there is an entertainment centre in the Olympic village.
There is, just in case, a learning plaque that reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, pool and tennis tables, board football and hockey, and some kind of weird devices like video machines.
I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team that actively uses a wild toy.
You could have just said you didn't want to talk to a man in the form of a Russian team, that's all.
By the way, there's some kind of strange coincidence in the eyes that makes the guys crawl in the bracing blacite.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to bypass the entire village by looking at every corner of the village.
But if you go, instead of driving electric cars, you're gonna have to open up the house of the Canadian elk team with the elk at the entrance and the tent with the refurbishment bath, and the ticket office, and the laundry and dry cleaning, and the hairdresser's shop, and the flower shop, and the shop with the everyday goods, and the mail with the unique stamps (only you can't wait out of the Chinese philatelics) and the bank, and the foundries, and the photokiosque.
And later in the evening, you will sit by the olive tree, with various coloured ribbons, in remembrance of the friends and relatives of the athlete who have left the world.
And you're gonna be under the back of a car that sprays fluid indiscriminately to kill insects, thinking about eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which doesn't stop for a minute in this village.
While the rest of the Russian world was holding their breath watching Australians almost punish American Dream Team, real fans went online.
Few people know that the message that Inna Deriglazov won gold in the rapira at the XXXI Olympics was first received.
Maybe I'm the only Moscowman who's ever seen this happen, apart from the ones who, of course, watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real cheerleader can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors downstairs, as always by 1:00 a.m., wake up and start screaming at each other very loudly.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
There's nothing in the TV schedule, so I just kept the Matthew, First and just in case, Rossia, under control, even though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the home of repetition, all sports there for some reason on tape.
There's live TV shows.
Hope, of course, on "Match," an entire evening, a young man screamed in news issues first about the great semi-finals of Deriglazov--Shanayev, then about the upcoming gold fight.
Makes sense.
But instead, basketball is US-- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong with that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put the Americans in the position of great-grandmothers.
As a result, they lost, but as is now expressed, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the fight is nearing Dee Francesca, and there's no change on the screen.
I'm starting to freak out at the canals in a light panic.
It feels like a second time in a row.
All right, let's go down to cable.
There is no swordsman on any of the theme "Matchees."
Oh, I feel like the fight is about to begin.
I don't like the text and tweeting of some sports sites.
The surfing is unexpected, but brilliant.
On the first website, it appears that all the competitions that take place at that time are being broadcast live.
I click for a swordsman, get a gold match.
Deryglaze counterattacks perfectly, goes ahead with points - and obviously starts to drag on time.
An Italian woman plays out the whole thing.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Dee Francesca throws herself at Deriglazov, she retreats, time is running out, the Italian injects a shot.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic massage on the phone reports on the fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the Plenum of DUM ordered its imams to preach on Fridays only in Tatar to force young Tatars "to learn their native language. '
The Office states that this "does not in any way infringe" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani complains that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience. '
Yesterday, the Plenum of the DM Tatarstan unanimously decided to carry out Friday sermons in the Republic ' s mosques in Tatar only.
According to the Mufti of Tatarstan, Camil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars "to learn their mother tongue."
"For those who say that "heavy" is, in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons in Tatar at no cost," promised Mr. Samigulin.
He added that the "decision has already come into effect" and today, in all mosques, the" must already be in the Tatar language. '
He recalled that the DUM Tatarstan published a magazine called Shura, which had model sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who doesn't speak Tatar well enough, "may well prepare for them."
The Tatarstan DUM brings together more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons in the districts are exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques had previously used Russian as their main language.
In particular, according to the Mufti, this was practised at the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership is to ensure that all students are proficient in both the Republic ' s State languages, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no harm to the Netatar Muslims," stressed Mr. Muhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a compulsory, essential part of the prayer."
The prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be maintained in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin said "I" that there was no serious threat of displacement of the Tatar language from the mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the preaching work in the Republic.
The decision of the DUM was strongly supported by the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WCC).
The head of the VCT, Rinat Zakirov, said, "I: Mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this sphere.
He noted that only the Tartar language was "the desire of the imams themselves," but that in the VCT, it was "the right thing to do."
The imams interviewed who were preaching in Russian are prepared to carry out the decision of the DUM, but they believe that they will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand languages.
Of course they're going to be too tight.
"I have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
Even many Tatars, he said, were closer to preaching in Russian, because "Russians are both in schools and in kindergartens, and radios are everywhere from the beginning."
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue its lessons and lectures in Russian, which were held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show you a way out of this."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"So we've been in Russian for four years," the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will "get to a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience. '
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the outcome of the preaching will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, I'm only gonna feel better because the Tatar language is my mother tongue," concluded Gabdullah Galiullin.
Former Director of the FIN has been brought to trial
The Moscow Public Prosecutor ' s Office confirmed the indictment in the criminal case of theft of the budget allocated to the Federal Penal Correction Service.
The ex-head of the prison administration, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, will be brought before the court, causing more than 2.7 billion rubles of damage to the Federal Penal Correction Service.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case to the Zamosquoretic District Court against Alexander Reimer, former director of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, his former deputy Nikolay Kriwolapov, as well as Viktor Odenov, director of the Federal Penal Correction Service Information, Technology and Communication Centre.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the State Security Service in Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of official powers resulting in serious consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed using their official position, in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolopov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the State Treasury the budget allocated by the SIF to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budgetary money, the group developed a scheme under which the CITOS enterprise under its supervision, with which the relevant State contracts were concluded, produced technical controls and supervision, including "electronic bracelets," and implemented at several-fold high prices.
Despite the fact that CITOS had no manufacturing equipment, buildings or facilities to house production facilities that would allow for the establishment of a complete electronic bracelets production cycle, five State contracts were concluded between it and the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service for the amount of more than 3.3 billion roubles.
As a result of this scheme, over 2 billion rubles were deposited in the accounts of the Samar branch of the FGCC, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
As a result, it is estimated that more than 140 million rubles of cash were received personally by Mr. Raimer in his office from an accomplice whose criminal case has been set aside for separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the scheme, was found to be of unknown origin with ammunition for the reward gun, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penal Correction Service filed an action for damages amounting to 2.7 billion roubles.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of being involved in the putch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then a member of Parliament, Hakan Shukur, and searched two of his family ' s homes.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s - the early 2000s, assailant Hakan Shukur is wanted by the authorities in connection with the coup attempt last month.
Forward, who graduated from a sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group."
This is the Hismet movement, a society linked to a well-known Turkish religious figure and oppositionist, Fethullah Gülen.
It is President Erdoğan who considers the attempted coup d ' état of 15 July to be the mastermind of the coup d ' état.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukur, and the police have already searched two houses belonging to a former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gülen's organization was joined by his father in addition to Hakan Shukur himself.
However, neither the former football player nor his family were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
==History==As a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated for the country.
He spent most of his career in Galatasarai.
The Italian "Torino," "Inter" and "Palermo," as well as the English "Blackburn," are listed on the list of foreign clubs.
True, he didn't spend more than one season in either of them.
Hakan Shukur remains Turkey's most successful assailant, with 112 national team matches and 51 scored balls.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his deputy post because of an ongoing corruption investigation around Erdoğan's party and its immediate environs.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey on 25 July.
They are accused of facilitating the military coup and of having links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media officers may wait for long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas, which were worth two to three times less than foreign-made films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for viewers with large Hollywood tapes.
We have over 100 paintings per year in the country, with an average of 20 to 25 tapes.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with Transformers and Iron Man, which has huge budgets," said the filmmaker.
On 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.

The new contractor promises to surrender to Zenit Arena by December 26th.
The new contractor for the St. Petersburg stadium, which is to host the Confederate Cup 2017 and the 2018 World Cup, Metrostroy promises to surrender the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Newsti with reference to Vadim Tülpanov, head of the Federation's Interim Commission for the 2018 World Cup.
"Today, with Russia's Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko visited the building, with us the CEO of Metrostroya, Vadim Alexandrov.
He said he'd rent the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious Petersburg company, it never breaks time limits.
Vitaly Mutko and I have been satisfied with what we have seen and heard," quoted by the interviewer's agency.
Previously, Vitaly Mutko had come to St. Petersburg to inspect the venue of the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tülpanov also noted that his commission, Sovfeda, would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction.
It was recalled yesterday that Metrostroy will complete the construction of Zenit Arena, with a contract price of about 5.4 billion roubles, and that the same company has won bidding to improve the area around the stadium, with a contract value of 2.4 billion roubles.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the stadium.

A lawyer, former Vice-Governor Nikolay Sandakova Konstantin Akulić, was detained in Miassa (Celabina region).
According to I-South Ural, another defendant's lawyer, Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulić, was called to the investigation department of SCR Miass today to press charges in a one-year-old assault case.
Then Konstantin Akulić went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to assist one of its participants.
"Initially, it was brought against unidentified persons, and now that he has begun to defend Nikolay Sandakov, it turns out that it was Akulić," Sergei Kolosovsky says.
Konstantin Akulić became counsel for the ex-substitute governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer was called to the SCR, Miass, the defence was informed that Monday was the end of the trial of the fraud case against Nikolay Sandakov.
We recall that two criminal proceedings have been instituted against Nikolay Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case), he is charged with a promise of 1.5 million rubles to facilitate the appointment to the post of Mayor of Magnithogorsk of the head of the administration of Lake Evgenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns the bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of Python POP, Igor Kalugin, in the form of an illegal donation of at least 1.3 million rubles of property.
For more information on Mr. Sandakov's case, read "I" in "The former Lieutenant Governor demands that his business be merged."
The Russian copper company (RMC) is prepared to assume social responsibility and to pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMI has embarked on the modernization of one of the country's oldest and most environmentally dirty enterprises, the Karabash medley plant.
==History==The Karabash Medal Plant was founded by an English stock company led by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country ' s economy, and it actually ensured the life of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, causing serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash honey-melt.
One of the main problems of the Karabash plant, the ecological one, also needed to be addressed.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation in Karabashmedi began to change in 2004 after the enterprise was taken over by the Russian copper company.
The company has begun to modernize its production, which has gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was also recently noted by Boris Dubrovsky, Governor of Chelyabinsk Region, who visited Karabashmed in the early days of July.
The head of South Urala described the huge changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmed had moved to the RMI group.
The main improvement of the Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant, which captures up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company, Vsevolod Levin, investment in the project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of the modernization of the Karabashmed ZAO is the reconstruction of the convertor.
The replacement of three converters, dusts, gas tractors is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, it is planned to launch a new 1 billion roubles industrial waste-water treatment plant at the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes allocated to the budget of the city of Karabash will also increase.
Over the entire period of the Tomin Goka project, from the beginning of the construction to the start of the second phase, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
And once the GCO is operational, taxes can reach 80.9 billion roubles at all levels.
During the year of production in the Varnen region, 346.3 million roubles have been allocated to the various levels of budgets.
And this is the first year.
"The longer the enterprise has been successful, the more it can be, " added Valery Ulanowski.
The RMC clarified that in 2015, tax revenues from the Michéev Goka came close to 1 billion roubles.
However, the participation of RMI enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax revenues.
RMI enterprises assist in the repair and maintenance of schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, the construction of recreational and recreational facilities and the development of territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabash was a major renovation, and in fact an almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten for 95 children.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
A landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports stores will also be located on the territory of RMC Arena.
The "RMC Arena" will make it possible to hold spectacular professional sports events at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercise and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, especially to children.

A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the Cape Cod Peninsula, U.S.A.
The man discovered a cancer among the others caught in his underwater trap, reporting to ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to the local oceanarium.
Lobster weighs about a kilo.
It is noted that Wayne Nickerson has been fishing lobsters for the past 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time a man had a blue lobster in 1990.
According to ABC News, crustaceans acquire blue or blue colour as a result of genetic changes.

The pensioner turned the stairwell into a budget beach tower.
Network users laughed at pictures of an elderly man putting a stairwell on the beach and turning it into a jumping trample into water.
The image was published on several entertainment portals, as well as on My Taganrog on the social network Vkontakte, which led many to believe that the photograph was taken on the coast of the Azov Sea.
In the commentary, "innovation" was described as "budget tower" and "mobile trample."
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sweetness," and some noted that the man was seriously at risk of being injured when he jumped off his tower because he had placed her in a low depth.
However, one of the switchboards on the Pikabu portal noted that the depth of the sea could not be judged by the image.
"First, we don't know how deep it is, the beach can be a bulwark with a steep fall by a metre right behind the stairs, and second, even if it's a metre of depth, you can jump from a few meters with proper skill," wrote the user under the name C0JIBADJZ.
At the same time, the Italian edition of Roma Today says that a man with a stairwell was seen on a beach near Rome.

The Evangelizing City Court (Amur Region) sentenced the former head of the city of Alexander Migulu to nine years of the general regime colony.
This is reported on the court's website on Friday, 12 August.
Migulu was found guilty of offences under articles 286 ("Excess of authority"), 285.1 ("Unearmarked budget spending") and 285 ("abuse of authority") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official had provided a familiar plot of land in the village of Muhinka in December 2008, in violation of the land law procedure.
In 2006, it illegally ordered the city to acquire a road bridge across the Chigiri River, at an overpriced price, without competitive procedures and a municipal contract, and specified Interfax.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Migula changed the timing of payments under the contract for the sale of the lease of the land that had been provided for the construction of the dwelling in the interest of the commercial organization under its control, as well as exempting the company from rent.
As a result, the region ' s budget fell short of 5 million rubles, while the city ' s treasury fell short of 21 million rubles.
On 4 August, it was reported that the former town commander, who was detained on suspicion of corruption and was seeking a deputy's mandate, had failed to provide sign-ups for the State Duma elections on time and had been removed from the electoral race.

The Thai police reported this, according to Reuters.
According to the police, they have not yet been able to determine whether these explosions are connected in any way.

Messengers and postal service owners must identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the summary of the draft law developed by the Media and Communications Union (ISU), which brings together the largest Russian communications operators (there is a "Vedomas").
The staff of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.
At the beginning of the fall, he is to be represented by a working group led by First Vice-Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, who says the "Vedomesti" interviewer at the ISS.

WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions on the Russian Federation because of the hacking of Democrat servers.
U.S. officials are considering introducing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
It is reported that in order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama's administration will have to formally accuse Russian servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence services are almost certain of Russia's involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the 2014 break-in of Sony Entertainment Pictures, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was initially directed against China, but it can be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, writing a publication.
Even if officials had concluded that hackers had acted with Russia's support, they would have to weigh the consequences before making a decision on disclosure.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It was previously reported that Barack Obama's administration allowed sanctions to be imposed on a State whose hackers hacked into the servers of the Democratic Party's National Committee.
WikiLeaks has published an e-mail from the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with Russian authorities could be involved in the break-in.
In the Kremlin, such reports were described as absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles.
The reason was the lack of competition in the mobile application market.
The anti-monopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components under conditions that prohibited pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position in the market and imposed the installation on mobile devices manufacturers along with Google Play other applications.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, reporting to FAS leader Alexei Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition law.
Google, for its part, intends to study the solution first and then decide whether to do it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in violation of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted until 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to do so.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
FÁS noted that despite the fine, they were discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This will not lead to anything.
This view of Ehu Moscow was expressed by the lead analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtasin.
Murtazine also noted that the fine would have no effect on both the users and the competitiveness of the corporation.
Voljanin rented an apartment and then stole 84,000 rubles from it.

The Anime effect of Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon of Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say that it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat tool allows approximately 150 million users per day to change reality and play with identity in ways that border absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to fit Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Lynses are crude, sparkling instruments that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes are quickly made known to the public.
Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark faces or encouraging white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week, which gave them their oblivious eyes, crooked teeth, and fluffy cheeks, some critics considered it a racist cartoon on Asians - the yellows.
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to the larger diversity problem of the company.
On Wednesday, reports and anger were disseminated on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced that it had been removed.
The company commented that the lens was designed as a tribute to anime characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But experts who know about racism are not aware of it, the lens is reminiscent of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet of photographs was actively shared, said that the lens was "insulting and at least awkward."
She added that "it was hard to argue with the comparison of a very rough Asian cartoon with the effects of a filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly pejorative yellow-faced.
Snapchat is not the only company that passes through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the Davies that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older generation - can mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, Katie Joo, 25, said, "This is a much harder move to stay invisible than it was before."
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her account in Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial contradictions were the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snapchat.
Ju criticized the predominantly white leadership of a company composed of only men and ended her article with a hashteg: #DeleteSnapchat.
According to Zhu, who is himself an American of Chinese origin: "If they had not enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, they do not hold positions where they can speak safely and openly."
Other observers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to concentrate on underrepresented populations and to actively engage domestic resources.
For her part, Ju said that she would keep her account in the Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say that it won't do."
Military leadership distorted ISIL intelligence, reported by a congressional commission
The U.S. Central Command officials changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground warranted, reported to the Congressional Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force set up by the Republican Presidents of the House of Representatives Committee on Supreme Court Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Military Appropriations found "a widespread discontent" among intelligence analysts of the Central Command who claimed that the leaders had forwarded their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as the Central Command, is the main military command in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"intelligence documents approved by the High Command of the Centcom generally gave a more optimistic picture of US anti-terrorist actions than confirmed by real data from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," was reported in the report's news release.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the highest leadership is given a false analysis, our military suffers," said House of Representatives member Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems in the Centre are reaching the top of the organization.
The 10-page report deals in detail with the deficiencies that were constantly encountered in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although he does not provide definitive evidence that the Obama administration ordered the reports to be falsified, he claims that analysts felt that the Centralcom leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than real events," reported the report.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, we know that for sure," said a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the highest management of the intelligence service of the U.S. Central Command forged command intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional investigation of Centcom intelligence, which has not yet been completed, is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"In the course of 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly closed procedure for conducting intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and Iraqi security forces," claims in a statement by House of Representatives member Adam B. Schiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party on the committee.
This procedure, according to Shifff, "has stalled the production of intelligence documents," damaged the morale of analysts and "does not sufficiently reflect divergent views."
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force the analysts of the Centcom to fit their findings into a "ordered or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which was opened after complaints by the Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the Inspector General's investigation continued.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree in the interpretation of integrated data, and intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics related to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence now claim) is reaching its targets.
But last year ' s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.
The criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State repeats disputes that occurred more than a decade ago when the intelligence analyst of the Tentcom, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article claiming that the administration of President George Walker Bush, because of the protests of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes at oil refineries belonging to the Islamic State had not significantly worsened the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Commander of Centcoma, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testifying in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins four consecutive times in a women's hockey on grass, bringing it closer to a decisive battle with Britain.
The one who scored three goals in a match that ended in defeating Japan with a score of 6-1, Katie Bam opened the score on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans won the 3-0 India team.
Five heads in two games are supposed to be a memorized achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she's not sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I don't know" she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who tracks their heads.
Here's what she knows: the American 4-0 account in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after Japan's 2-0 game on Thursday.
British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first tour.
Both teams claim a quarter-final, and the result of the game will determine who will be number one in their six-team group and who will be number two.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little while later when the quarterfinals games begin.
But Saturday's game shows that Americans here made noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took last place among the 12 teams in the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time taking a hockey club on grass when she was 3 (her older twins played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she didn't go to the finals.
Then 2012 came when she and her teammates weren't getting along.
The following year, Koaig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the first half of the game with an uncomfortable arm at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the 1-0 count until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long walk with the ball down the left side of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral, and sent the ball sharply into the gate, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to miss one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's on fire.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the rampage of the Olympic Games, "jen" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio seem to be constant and inevitable, a ferocious combination of competition and aspiration.
It's like the Olympic fire itself is that burning torch that goes from an archer to a swimmer, to a gymnast, to a triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the paper, or listen to your neighbors in turn at the cafe and not hear about Simone Byles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, first-time Olympics player, a handsome man with dimples on his cheeks, could well be one of those celebrities who are shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-supporters if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline competition.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows, are sports that are not generally accepted: shooting with a pneumatic gun, onions, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak out in self-defense, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many people I interviewed have not known that they are at all part of the Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumps, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share men ' s awards and Chinese and Canadians women ' s awards.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLeannan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outsider's charm, especially because for an unenlightened ear, they are associated with a circus college rather than with the Olympics.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a ground enthusiast.
They do have comic potential - caricature milling of endless jumps - but also the grace of gymnastics and jumps into the water, two kinds of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "putt" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín," meaning "dumping trumpline."
The winners jump on a giant trampoline, taking almost 30 feet into the air, and have to perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and coats) before they finally land on their feet.
They are evaluated on performance, complexity and "time of flight" according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
Proponents for the medal should go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth, down and down the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of TV cameras, another teasing frontier: the world or the Olympic record.
It's a hard drive, a noble, adorable, even fanatical, and enough to make even the audience cry.
But I think it's a little tired watching the Games.
It gives you a break from jumping on the trampoline.
Batutist's heading up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then no effort again up.
And they certainly don't go without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program, there's no crazy rush to the finish line, no jumps in length, only a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest thing to Zen Olympic sport.
Women ' s qualification competitions, followed by the finals on Friday afternoon, airing at Eastern European time one hour; men ' s on Saturday, also at one hour.
The NBC will broadcast the end of the day program from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m. each day.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in a common dump.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to desirable views and objectivity - as according to the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male hymns from the United States - Dooley is waiting for his new delicious crowd of fans.
"The Generation protests" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the US
Rigorous protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced violent opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Video recordings from protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of last year or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were placed with their hands against the wall.
The highest United Nations human rights official now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It's always been hard to keep this country from falling apart, and it's gonna be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project in the international research crisis team.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably, even with a new suburban train in Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently referred to government repression - the opposition in the territory of the State has been stopped by the fact that dissidents have in fact been silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly repressed and left with no alternative but to protest, there will be an uprising," said Seyoum Teshomé, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the takeover of power by a government coalition.
After widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely replaced the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the border with Eritrea is increasing; the struggle over this uncertain, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit unrest and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling deep down for several years, are exploding now.
The first one seems completely harmless: smartphones.
In the past few years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized their protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Throughout the centuries, Amhara of the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will work together under one authority," said Mulat Gemech, leader of Oromo.
Major protests took place in Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tigray ethnic group, which is about 6 per cent of the population and which controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics, are unjustly dominant in Ethiopia.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skilled in recognizing the first signs of discontent and using scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
"The present regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalene, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
The analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services under Tigray control.
Many fear that this will lead to further bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said seemed to be elections that the Government had failed and then forged results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest was relatively rapid.
Development experts commended Ethiopia ' s leaders for the forward-looking development of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the rise of internal discontent with the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, Amhara, attacked Tiger-owned businesses, and anti-Tygray hatred on social media is becoming pervasive.
Analysts claim that the protesters are embarrassing the United States and other Western allies.
The United States Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already volatile region.
"And it's gonna be hard to get through this tight rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the last conflict that covered his campaign headquarters on Friday, arguing that he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to approach the American people wisely.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position because they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After saying this idea at the Wednesday evening convention, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded ISIS.
But on Twitter in the early morning of Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just snooping.
This post was in direct contrast to the allegation made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Hugh Hewitt, the radio conservator, tried to help Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal broke out when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against a declining rating.
Trump and Clinton gave competing speeches about Michigan's economy this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to get back to the subject.
Again using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase taxes and said that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm earlier as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he came up with general criticism, practically expressing the idea that Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and to take back his words if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some of the messages that have a response among his fans, watching them act, and then "explaining" them one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, the communications expert who analysed both candidates' language.
But I also think he's careful about his comments and knows they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening statements for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ratings continue to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is giving way to Clinton, with a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and is on course with her in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump became the focus of the presidential campaign in recent months, his jokes have embarrassed his loyal allies: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said when asked about Trump's credibility that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It's true that before Obama ISIL was an almost unknown little organization, he called it no threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans assure us that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued his Twitter attack on the media for mumbling every word he said and prejudiced him.
He bullied "poor poor" television experts trying to solve it, and he said, "We're weak!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuses as an unnecessary confirmation that he was not fit to be president.
Once displaced, the coffee shop returns to Greenpoint.
Verb's coffee shop was stunned, only taking in cash in Williamsberg, which wasn't Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Sheri, which took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a new city.
The artist Molly Krabaple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York is constantly changing, it is in turn being updated.
Verb's revived coffee shop opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to fund him in a new place, he said he'd be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left much behind.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It's even got the chandeliers from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu presents bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and has capers or fried onions.
There's brown rice.
The coffee shop doesn't serve beer anymore, but they're making freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the steady flow of old regular clients.
"A lot of ex-boyfriends have been pushed out of Williamsberg, too," he shared.
In a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often visited Verbe.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After she shut down Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was coffee and the atmosphere that imponed me in Verbe," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although on that day, instead of the usual ice-coffee, she ordered bathed tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At 15 o'clock every day, like clockwork, I came, and for me, my bagel was made with butter and all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes a routine order, but one day he's gonna change things with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the stuff.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the store had once taken over an old place.
Moreover, the owners of the Soap Sherry offered to make special soap for Verb, using coffee from a coffee shop prepared coldly, as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other benefits to the new place.
The local juice sales point plans to spill bottles and sell cold coffee.
There's a possibility that a coffee shop will join a nearby building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was killed in grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was coming home.
"How long I've wanted to feel this smell," he admitted.
A depressing meal of depression in the Snack Snack.
In March 1933, shortly after climbing to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue fashionable dishes, such as foie gras and Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest, with pruning eggs in tomato sauce, potato mashed potatoes and pudding on dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
Coa's last book, "Ragu in Chinese," was dedicated to Chinese food in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side via food in her book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street."
Their new joint work, "The Flying Dinner," to be published on Tuesday by Harper's publishing house, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop dinner, a tiny, simple diner in the Flatayron Quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and an olive sliced sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food in the era of Depression.
"Roullets were in great demand," said Siegelman.
There was a peanut roll, a baker roll, a bean roll.
They were made of the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched out.
Imagine eating as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Coe wrinkled.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women's groups were cooking for male farm workers, and fresh cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The "Fleet meal" describes how the country managed to stop being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was also difficult: mysterious dishes, such as roulettes and casseroles, became basic foods; casserole - "a beautiful way to dispose of scraps" - Zigelman noted because cooks could hide non-appetite ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which for many years has been the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
By doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: a baked onion, filled with peanut butter.
"This supplement to the dining table wasn't a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added, "It was really weird."
Peanut butter doesn't fit the baked onions at all.
This was common in many homemade recipes.
More than ever, homemakers - including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - managed the country's food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers," accept the challenge, and transform the bourde, like wiped spaghetti with carrots, into delicious dishes.
"Fleet meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
The stories of the government's response to starving citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of "let the pies eat," are particularly picant.
Publicly praising the simple farm cooking of the Iowa state at the time of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked the continental kitchen, like the cucumber sauce fish," Coe said.
He ate practically in the gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantasticly cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn't advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book says, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, which led to the White House "using not only the dullest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked food."
Many of the depressive culinary practices were forgotten as soon as the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they learned better about the eating habits of Mother Siegelman - that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of sloppy food," said Coe.
Siegelman remembers, "She really poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case of pros.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got dessert that they made at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a prune mousse," said Siegelman, adding that it was a common technique - to give modest recipes a cross-reference.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everybody reluctantly put a spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe asked for extras twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he told his wife, "A little walnut ruble wouldn't be a problem here."
Arrest of figures in the case of mass fighting at the Howan Cemetery extended until 14 November
The Presna Court left the case of mass fighting in the Howan Cemetery under arrest until 14 November, granting the request of the investigation.
There are 14 accused persons in the case.
It will be recalled that on 14 May, several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus were subjected to a large-scale arms fight in the Howan Cemetery, which resulted in the deaths of three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuria Chabuyeva, and a lawyer, the co-founder of the public organization Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second pension indexation in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Holodec, during a visit to Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters on how much it is necessary to raise pensions in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now taking stock of the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two to three weeks, quote the Hungry Interfax.
Commenting on the six-year increase in retirement age proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexei Kudrin, the Vice-Prime Minister reported that the subject was not addressed in the Cabmine.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the finals of the small-caliber rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the finals of the small-caliber rifle shooting competition from the position of lying at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and ranked first, the new Olympic record.
Kirill Grigoryan became second - 628.9 wash.
The finals were attended by eight of the best athletes.
Kamenski is a world record in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état," quoted by the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denied any involvement in the coup d ' état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
Let us recall that the attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead will reimburse lawyers during the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to recover the legal fees that it incurred in relation to the patenting of hepatitis C with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million for violations of two Merck patents related to Gilead medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvani, after an American judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including lies under oath and other unethical acts.
In a lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to recover the costs incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work, which is at the heart of the sophosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-supported armed forces claim to have intercepted complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
The U.S.-backed armed forces took full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city and informed the band's representative on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now cleaning up the city after leaving the remaining group of fighters who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by militants, informed Reuters of Sharfan Darwish of the Union with the VTS of the Manbij Military Council.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we're doing clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and a former Secretary of State claimed $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
In contrast to them, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and breaks his previous promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers described the State Tax Service's audit as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax returns.
"Your move," posted on Twitter by Clinton's campaign counselor Jan Sams, referring to the Democratic candidate's announcement.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he wouldn't let Trump release them before the tests were over.
Trump ' s critics, including Mitt Romney ' s Republican presidential candidate in 2012 and other Republican fellows, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed the question and released an online video on Friday, focusing on prominent Republicans who persuaded Trump to publish tax reports.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done without exception to the presidential candidate for decades: publish his tax returns," she said to the gathering.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business reviewer quoted many tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who believed that they might still be doing so.
Federal tax rates were disputed in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, suggested that Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny, and Trump wasn't afraid of the tax agency, he was afraid of voters.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters has issued tax returns up to 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration of 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using a non-traditional way of preventing elephants from wandering into communities by dropping condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the American Nature Conservation Committee, took on the task of training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step approach to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"since we invented a set of tools... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting elephants," said the executive director of Honeyguide Damian Bell.
The first two steps are the lighting of the torch in front of the trespassing elephant and the transmission of horn signals.
If he hasn't been scared off, he's being dumped by the so-called "chili cloud."
A chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cotton in a condom, and its end is twisted, and only the wick remains outside.
When a condom is lit, it blew up, spraying chili powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
This information was provided by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlyut Chavushoğlu, in an interview with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 career diplomats to continue their work at the centre.
Of these, 32 did not return without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign service.
Let us recall that a coup attempt took place in Turkey in July.
The authorities had officially announced that the coup d ' état had failed and had also reported the detention of over 6,000 persons, including senior and middle-ranking military officials.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people died as a result of the coup attempt.
The Jewish director strongly criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's phone code from the Arab "please," reported RT News.
A French director of Jewish origin started a media scandal, discovering that the Keminski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israeli telephone code on its list, and officials referred to "requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the documentary on the Holocaust, Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in German media, FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lantzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the hotel's telephone code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which to call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
Lanzman wrote it.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the matter at the hotel management counter.
The answer he got there, according to Lantzman, was "shocking him."
The hotel clerk said that this measure was "a thought-provoking decision by the management of the Keminski Hotel Network."
The reason behind this move has caused even greater anger on the part of the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lanzman, a hotel employee.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as "a terrible shame, " reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that it happened in Germany and in this hotel network is even more shameful.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to come to the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "going on about" with the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"We would be ashamed," said another post, where it was stated that the hotel on the glorious Kurfurstendam street was near the synagogue.
The hotel itself hurried to dismiss any charges, calling what had happened "invisibility" and "apologizing" to Lantzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the rapid recruitment list," quotes a representative of the Keminski Hotel newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian student protesters
The students encountered police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The unrest began when police officers tried to disperse students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reassigned to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing on the walls of graffiti directed against interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place only a few days after the protesters went out on the streets to support the suspended President, Dilma Rusef, when the country's Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - reported RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there had been an increase in the interest of Russian firms in doing business in the country, as the Ambassador had said.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent, compared with the same period in 2015, to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
Increased trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan is also projecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia ' s diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The State continues to twist the nuts in the defence and industry complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the CEO of the Almaz-Antei company, the "miss of work" and the "loss of trust."
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed NGO leader for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media attention.
How can we explain this silence in the face of a massive rearmament of the army?
The Russian Federation's leadership probably does not want any rumours or negative assumptions to spread in the public environment.
This further confirms that the defence and industry complex (DC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of industrial order.
The Almaz NGO is the parent company of the company, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based air defence systems.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus CDCs, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitri Kornev, believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov was due to the delay in the projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began as early as 2007 and was expected to start in 2013.
Police Reddut is supposed to be the main air defence system on the newest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, no truly successful test has been carried out in the course of several years of testing.
The truth, as far as I can tell, is that there is no clear fault with Almas, says Cornev.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may also occur with C-500.
The project ' s development work has not yet been completed, but the first complexes are expected to enter the force during 2016.
The Ministry of Defence is satisfied that "the work is planned and all will be completed within the established time frame," although in 2014 the agency acknowledged that there were problems with the development of C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Almas since 2011.
Cornev noted that project delays could be both an occasion and a reason for dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in PKIs and enterprise management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
As a general rule, directors of defence companies resign at will, by agreement of the parties, or are reassigned to other jobs.
In the present case, the suspension took place publicly, although it was not resonant.
This suggests that the leader of Almasa may have been a figure of strategism and resisted the descending of the "classies" from above.
It appears that the State no longer intends to tolerate such conduct.
By the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence's installations and fail to carry out the tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation is seeking to punish the rugged managers (Star Shipyard Machinations).
The President is personally paying increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin chairs the Military Industrialization Commission and meets periodically on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of PKI managers in an effort to have a loyal board of directors who will comply with orders received from the top.
This is a far from ideal policy, but in the face of widespread corruption and the absence of normal competition in the PKI, the State has no other instruments.
The current situation in defence is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of the managers in the PLO, the leadership of the Russian Federation has taken quite successful steps to enhance the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army ' s staff has acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigou as Minister of Defence.
The president seems to have adopted the famous saying, "You want peace, prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
The bipolar system, with all its shortcomings, worked quite well.
This has been demonstrated by the absence of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the "winners" in the cold war ended with the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no quiet corner left in the civilized world.
Despite a common disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia on the level of equal partner.
In such circumstances, the fleet and the army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend its national interests and to reach new world political boundaries.
Scotsman Callum Skinner runs down the finish line, causing the British to capture bicycle gold.
Scotsman Callum Skinner was running for the triumph in a men ' s command sprint in Rio last night, as a result of which the British team trio defended its title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow was the strongest one his friend, Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland, had made his own, and the young man was proud to enter history by running down the finish line to break the victory from the team's favourite from New Zealand.
Britain claimed rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modest sixths at the March World Championships in London, even though Hoy had finished his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the participant's specialist Jamie Staff.
They did exactly what they did when the Hindes showed up.
Hoey's departure also created a void that Kean Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing potential in a Scottish man who had now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in skill, but the standard was exceeded by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported it.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes was going on a bigger show to slow down and let Kenny and, in particular, Skinner keep up.
Hoy watched from his seat as a guest expert at the BBC and caught Skinner, Kenny, and Hindez's eyes when they joined the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling on the track after a failed start.
He later rejected the comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain's competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the stand."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many races with a world name, it was amazing to win the Olympics again.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of 10 race titles both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress over the past five months, then the cycle will have five more successful days.
With Kenny's form, it's not beyond his ability to imagine how he repeats Hoy's exploit by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same game.
This would make it possible to see Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - bring his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It'd be just like Hoey's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get knighthood."
It was the only medal play in a day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dull are qualified as the fastest four-kilometre-long command race of pursuit.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world record for gold winning in London 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the finals (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the quarry, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
At the relevant women's event, which is resumed and concluded tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Schand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald of Milngawi improved the world record by showing time 4:13.260.
The British team has come to rely on a powerful cyclist team to take over the middle of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After, in fact, exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the second place, not least the withdrawal from the position of technical director Shane Sutton in April because of accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first night race on the bike, it seems that the legendary now British glory of reaching the tops at the right time may be about to repeat itself.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Plant in Victoria - as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers - is threatened by the fact that the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is planning to terminate the supply contract: all delivery contracts are scheduled to be terminated.
This is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed grant expires for 20 years in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
A total of 2,000 jobs - directly and indirectly - may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the steel plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland metallurgy plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflection on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strength of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant ' s products.
AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it expected the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by the joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called "hedging contracts," which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"AGL, respectively, still expects these contracts to yield their share of revenue in the 2017 fiscal year," stated the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from fiscal year 2018 is currently limited by forecasts of a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million in the form of "preliminary avoidance."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to manage the metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgical plant."
The American company stated that it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but that it had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Victorian Portland Metallurgy Plant and the Tomago Plant near Newcastle because of the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the Chief of Operations of AGL, Stephen Mickelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the market [electricity].
It would be bad for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Not just the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall, on the cover of the September issue Vogue
Kendall Jenner, age 20, model and fourth daughter of the Cardashian-Jenner clan of Mother Manager Chris, appeared on the wanted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defiled during fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at the cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover news was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian family?), a reality video in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (the Rob and Caitlin deboshires, who also joined them as the world's favourite uncle of the show business, producer Ryan Sicrest of the Kardashian family), forgot to appear on the cover and, at the end, a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost every episode of a children's television show dedicated to a birthday (Cycrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed this glory to come to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have certainly entered the new era of the Kardashian Show.
Even though Kendall Kim's older sister may have been on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of Vogue in the year.
A thickness similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine attracts a huge number of advertisers (based on the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of who of the stars will be on his cover is so much awaited that in the last two years, photos of the magazine have merged to the official annoyance.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has certainly been more "modules that work models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities."
The Oscar Award winner and Dior Jennifer Lawrence's brand face were presented on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gage's honor was granted.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "excellent model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not related to known people, to reality stars, or to modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful years of his career with the release of Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past television reality star, should always have remained shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment."
These moods were rekindled after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense to dwell on resentment.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of a September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sells you their photos in their own apps available on a subscription fee.
She sells her own photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's on a reality TV show.
Public Law Centers refuse services to 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the population ' s least protected persons are denied services in community legal centres, as the sector is preparing for an impact that will further reduce funding to activities already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unjust deprivation of property and so on - have already been denied free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the limits are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The director of Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the latest census of the National Association of Public Law Centres, thousands of people a year were denied.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not reversed, the situation would only worsen.
"Queensland's community law centres are consistently under-funded, meaning thousands of people are denied vital services," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and wasteful debts, families going through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected Queenslanders will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Senator Queensland George Brandis to cancel these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to focus on the needs of community law centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Government of Palasuk to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued after a staff member allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued: it was alleged that the headquarters did not do anything after a report that his North Carolina operations director threatened a staff member with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at state election headquarters.
Bordini said he'd been waiting months for the problem to be resolved internally, but he realized it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip "gone the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the duck at Vincent's kneecap," so Bordy claims in the complaint.
By complaining to the local and regional headquarters of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, claiming to be in contact.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to hurt," said Bordini in the complaint.
The lawsuit occurred only two days after the Republican presidential candidate produced a furor, telling North Carolina listeners that the "Second Amendment People" - understood as arms owners and amateurs - could act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could select judges.
Trump's pre-election headquarters said that the media took his words out of context and that he did not speak out in favour of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini claims compensation from the election headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for threats of physical violence, insults and moral damage.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back fast.
Donald Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg High Court Division (Charlott).
Britain must put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow.
It will also bring a revival and prosperity, not only in our human settlements and London as a whole, but throughout the country.
As far as I'm concerned, this was exactly the great advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we're gonna do it again, creating opportunities for locals and firms next to Heathrow.
Only for our communities here will we create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like London 2012, there's gonna be people who think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget, from T5 to the top terminal of the airport for five years in a row, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two most occupied airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, supported by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure Heathrow's expansion will be as well.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand the Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Treasury Commercial Attaché
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cats and mouse on the advertising block.
For companies that make money on Internet advertising, trying to bypass software to block advertising is a game of cats and mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog entry that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social media again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the circle around its commercials to make it more difficult for advertising blockers to recognize what parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims to have been able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, Adblock's spokesman, Ben Williams, wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising blocker community and those trying to bypass it has continued since the invention of the advertising block," and Facebook is likely to present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network has come to a fight is a clear indication of how much of a problem advertising blockers have become to the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year ' s study of Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of users of such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who enter Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising income.
However, the company's hunting for desktop advertising blockers, as mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
However, ads in the desktop version are sufficiently profitable to make Facebook consider such a move a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how they were being targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were a cause for concern, as they would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
"It's not going to be a good experience for people, and we're planning to solve this problem," Facebook said in an official e-mail.
Advertisers are a rude tool, so we've instead focused on creating tools such as advertising preferences to put governance in the hands of people.
The woman was moved on the Swiss highway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman has moved several vehicles on the highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident took place on A1 near Morge in Vaud Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay on the road in the dark "in a show of despair" and was hit by a number of vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
In a clear attempt to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, struck several vehicles, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have still not been identified, and the police have informed them that they and someone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted, a "logical" step in this situation, and the lawyer Gilé Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve has stated.
However, it remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will press charges.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the D.A." Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a man walking in the dark on the highway - a verdict was handed down that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of reckless death after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Piern at night in August 2014.
22-year-old victim drank and passed out on the road, heard a trial.
The court found that the female police officer - who had responded to an emergency call - had been driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "an exceptional and unpredictable situation" - had been declared by the judge.
Anyone who has knowledge of the incident on Thursday near Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
The scientists at the Goddard Institute of Space Studies of Nasov developed a model for the study of the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere oversaturated by carbon dioxide, conditions such as the Earth could ever exist.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus' small speed of rotation was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could probably have a diluted atmosphere similar to the Earth, and still rotate slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent of the party.
"According to the GIS model, the slow rotation of Venus puts its day side on the sun for almost two months at a time," explained in a press release by a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
It warms the surface of the planet and makes rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, acting as an umbrella protecting the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun's heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously anticipated by planetary researchers.
Although Venus may have been inhabited once, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned with ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - that is, Venus, as we know it today - remained.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model for Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche team coach post.
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice president of the hockey activity Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The Executive Vice President/Chief Manager of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as chief coach and vice president of the hockey activity Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must ideally coincide with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best league coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and played playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season, and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper from Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each from Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Work strikes on the salaries of oil workers in the North Sea have been suspended, and all parties to the debate are embarking on a new round of talks, with key representatives of the parties reporting.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Alliances Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes," says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential salary cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent due to negative market tensions.
The decline in the company ' s rates followed a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for offshore contract employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space it needed to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries to 10 as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-merger with the British power company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower prices for untreated oil: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision taken by the United Kingdom in June to withdraw from the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes in the North Sea of our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of the cost of new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Plead cluster
The last mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalogue of rotation speeds of stars entering the Plead cluster.
New data help astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," explained in a press release by Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
==History==The Plead cluster is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll ever be.
At their peak speeds, these growing stars throw out large numbers of stars.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds are slowing down the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stars, such as sun spots.
The newest speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than smaller massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger pirouettes are slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet of the Plead, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster tend to be very light stars," Riball said.
Since the Plead cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Star Cluster of the Pleiade provides a starting point for theoretical patterns of rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where and why stars slow down their rotations and hang their "dance shoes" on their nails, symbolically speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Plead's rotation speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
The investigation of a group of detainees in Crimea by Ukrainian sabotagers is being conducted by two departments and writes "Commersant'."
The FSB gathers evidence of detainees ' involvement in the preparation of sabotages in Crimea.
As previously reported, a Ukrainian resident of Energodar, Evgeniy Panov, confessed and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he viewed the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil bazaar in Feodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline and a military airfield as diversion sites.
Law enforcement believes that not all of the saboteurs' associates have been apprehended.
This led, inter alia, to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev District Court of Simferopol, noting the publication.
The main coach of Russia's football team was Stanislav Churchesov.
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint Stanislav Churchesov as the chief coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will last for two years, until the completion of PM-2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Churchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played in Moscow's Spartacus position as a goalkeeper, as well as a trainer with solid experience, who mentored Russian teams such as the same Spartacus, Zhemchuzhina Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dinamo, and Warsaw's Legia, who became the winner of the country's national championship and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Churchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will last for two years.
It is thus his responsibility to prepare for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauce, Vladimir Pannikov, will enter his training headquarters.
There's information that the entire coach's salary is 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation has set a goal for Stanislav Churches to bring Russia's team to the semi-finals and win medals.
According to the coach himself, he sees as a priority the creation of a competitive team environment and is going to give footballers the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Churchesov, he is glad that the choice was his.
The first match, led by Churchesov, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, earlier, Leonid Slutsky served as the head coach of the Russian football team, combining him with his training at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after Russia's national team failed at Euro2016 in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the bad outcome of the team.
Stuck between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous strides, particularly in the past few years.
Namibia ' s main reason for its success is the Government ' s emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries are taken for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce fees for "cost recovery."
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also been free of charge.
The country ' s authorities are also active in other important areas.
Efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
The Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, dropped by 15 points compared to 1993.
That figure was one of the highest in the world 23 years ago.
The poverty rate fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rate of freedom of expression in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other wealthy nations have far outstripped the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Perceptions of Corruption, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even at a time when commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of US and most European debt levels.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional estimation methods, remains fairly high, at almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, with almost 17 per cent of the population infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is a top-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the desert, there are isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers who in one way or another must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just as any other country in the world is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought to give up, but it was dealing with the problems it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about the construction of a wall that separates the country from its poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians have learned that neighbours do not choose, but have decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investment and to exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia rightly considered that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities are aware of the need to invest in infrastructure and productive capacity from Namibia ' s natural wealth.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of the country ' s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that they do.
Transparency was crucial to that process, and the Government ' s strong support for freedom of expression was so important.
According to Head of State Hage Geingob, the media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, says the President.
Not all Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia has shown that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and follow-up.
Many have heard of Varna's Gold, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
It was probably the loudest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: Bulgaria, during the excavation of the Varnen Necropol, found a fantastic amount of gold artifacts - over 3,000 pounds [6 kg] in total.
Only one burial, known as "mogila No. 43," has resulted in the recovery of 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon be converted to the unmatched bead found by archeologists in July of this year.
Once again, Bulgaria is in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite in the Pazardzik district.
Busina is a gold stripe wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, the head of the Tella Unacite excavation, dated the discovery from 4,600 B.C.E. and stated that she was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
Varna's treasures, again, date around the same period, 4,600 to 4,200 BC.
There is currently no technology that allows metal to be dated with impeccable accuracy.
How can you be sure which gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm pretty sure Yunacite gold is older than Varna's gold."
It's an extremely important discovery: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Bojadzhiev reported that scientists would soon analyse the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and study more thoroughly the archaeological seam where the gold artifact was found.
This will help you to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location explains a lot, too.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yunacite is now considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
The Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7 millennium B.C.E.
Over the next centuries, the region has developed a lot of metal processing, from the first metallurgy skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national history of this archaeological community, there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpatian metallurgical province.
In the 5 millennium B.C., urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centres.
They are now called ancient cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite may be the oldest, as the 4900 BC artifacts were found here.
I'd call Tell Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, even though it's an ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place older than Sumer by a thousand years," says Bojadzhiev, bearing in mind the generally accepted view that urban culture has been born in the south of Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
The first cities appeared there in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tell Yunacite have been under way since 1976.
In that time, archaeologists have dug up almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, once three metres high, were found.
Little remained from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, the "business centre" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunacite is often referred to as the Bird City, where dozens of clay birds were found.
All birds are shown in a state of rest, suggesting that they were objects of local worship rather than decorative objects.
The bird city was destroyed around 4100 B.C. - perhaps by the Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no towns, but horses and guns.
The three-metre serf walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: remains of the elderly, women and children were found inside the houses, with marks of wounds caused by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts are emerging every year, changing the way we know the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" of Europe's first civilization, born in the Balkans.
The "Gold of Varna" found relatively recently in 1972 was a powerful incentive to search for this civilization.
Logically, Varna's gold luxury had to have been preceded by something like a tiny gold bead built in Tella Yunacite.
In Porsche, the model 911 Targa was artificially aged.
It is officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being trained manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
==History=="Retro-Luc" consists, for example, of the Etna Blue body color, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the Targa received a special white graphic along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel drives, as well as some body design parts painted in white-gold metal.
In the interior, the lines are significantly smaller: they are largely distinguished by the grey blue gamma, new seats with extended range of electrical adjustments, and separated black anodized steel thresholds with the unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car cover as a gift and a rich album with photographs of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive does not touch steel: the retro-tarch is very similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a turbocharged six-cylinder engine of 3.0 l, which develops 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in four seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued in limited circulation, but neither the volume nor the value of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers launched an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent social media advertising has provoked decision-makers to block advertising for retaliation.
AdBlock Plus released an antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus promoted her new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
The social media representatives noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the decision by AdBlock Plus, along with commercial advertisements, blocked many regular posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they deplored this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to the source among social media developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop site will be ready within the next hours.
So the social media and blockers started a kind of "arms race," trying to beat each other, but the injured party was the users who missed interesting notes from friends or saw ads where they weren't used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising have been controversial lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to trial: Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed before the Russian Federation ' s Investigation Committee for Murmansk Region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious: sexual assault.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused at Pavlova Street in Murmansk had committed acts of a sexual nature involving violence against a 20-year-old girl; the criminal case with the confirmed indictment was sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia a crosswen Fengguang 370 and a Rich New pickup truck, which will be driven by www.zr.ru.
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China's car class, which combines the dignity of a minivan and a sneaker.
Another claimed Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms in the Moscow International Motor Show this year have decided to ignore, so the void of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large species on the Russian market and intends to offer some interesting new developments to our motorists in the near future, will be a powerful front.
One of them will be a crosswen Dongfeng Fengguang 370 marketed in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550,000 roubles at current rates).
Russians are unlikely to see such a price, and the question of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 was able to reach number 11 on the list of best-selling minivans on June sales, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic overhang on the lower perimeter of the body, it is quite possible to assign it to the sneakers.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the Fengguang 360 model, 370 has the same wheelbase of 2,725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4,510 mm), the design is stronger and the equipment is richer.
The salon was decorated with wooden bars, but the large vertical sensor screen "like Tesla's" on the central console was only on early cross-swan exhibits, and the cars with "music" were easier to sell.
Five of the seven seating places are easily assembled, forming a level loading area of 1,650 mm in length, with a maximum volume of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine is equipped with only one - 1.5-litre petrol atmospheric with a capacity of 115 hp coupled to a 5-speed mechanical gearbox.
The machine's dynamic qualities are modestly silent, but it promises a stifling budget of an appetite of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New is a well-known Russian NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly lovable Chinese design style.
Despite a morally obsolete design, the model is still in stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwitting "working horse."
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines for choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 l.p.) or turbodize 2.5 l (116 l.p.).
The gearbox is just a mechanic, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly plugged "forward."
It will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship sedan A9, and its Russian premiere representation from a Chinese firm announced in June.
The Chinese market is becoming more and more Minvan-like crosses, one of the most recent new developments - Covin V3 and SWM X7.
The Dongfeng line currently consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
During the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax alerts will cease to be sent by mail - the website Driving www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for issuing property tax notices.
All Russian auto owners are used to the pattern of the unchanging years: in summer and autumn, they receive a letter of credit for the previous year's transport tax.
This year, however, many will not wait for them.
The fact is, the tax inspectorate has changed the way citizens are notified.
Those who are registered in the Taxpayer's Personal Office on the official website of the Nalog.ru department will be notified electronically.
The inspectors automatically considered such Russians online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" distribution.
The new developments will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All the others will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, there is also an opportunity to go back to the old scheme for account holders on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office and write a statement during the month of August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" immediately after writing, while the letter will run for a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection service has passed over to 18 million people, allowing the agency to save heavily on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed procedure.
Some may have registered in the "personal room" for a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not be expected to be notified by post and will fall into the category of non-payers without knowledge, with all the consequences.
Access to the Taxpayer's Personal Office is made in three ways: through the Gosuslugi.ru portal account, by means of an electronic signature or by means of the input of the logic and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person from any tax inspection office (regardless of the place of registration).
We recall that this year the transport tax has to be paid before 1 December.
Notifications began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve very high returns, is a thing of itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse G-Power's masters, who took on the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not upgrade G 63 to 571-strong flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and a 100-second push in 5.4 seconds?
By inflating the muscles of a crazy gelica, the masters took advantage of the 5.5-litre G-8 boost.
Now, the dynamics of the break-up to a hundred have improved to the indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying Cyprus is capable of a 5.3 s push.
However, the accelerations from the average speeds are probably better for him.
The speed limit is frightening: if standard G 63 does not travel faster than 210 km/h, a tuning all-way vehicle with a deactivated electronic collar can press 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost identical to its factory source, with the exception of other wheel drives - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimensions 305/35 ZR 23.
Mercedes-Maybach's Lux Division announced an amazing six-metre-long conceptual coupe that would be presented in the Pebble Beach Elegant Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
A minimum of four green novelties are expected in the coming years.
