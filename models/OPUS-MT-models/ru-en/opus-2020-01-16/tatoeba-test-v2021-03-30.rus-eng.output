There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to buy time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke an awful, Jewish dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the failure to claim the existence of a holy language, the use of which in prayers is particularly close to God.
Tom eventually changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.

I wish I knew what to tell them.

It's not God's word of science.

Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.

How wonderful is that?
I'm hungover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is good for sale.
I have to work this weekend.

I know what Tom should have done.
Tell her I said hi.
Was that a lie?

It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.

You're very discerning.
Over and over again, there are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.

Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom is at school now, isn't he?
Please let us know.

Do you have any pain anywhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it in!

I think Tom can be trusted.
There's a lot of riddles in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
This apple is rotten.

We really need this.
I called him, but the line was busy.

"How did the accident happen?" "No one knows."
What do you like about him?

We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.

We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I like stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom threw Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foresaw the balance in Jesus Christ between royal power and the clergy.
Do you want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to his house.
It's thin, but it's strong and it's not ripping.
It's all a little stupid.
At this point, I don't know what I want.
This is incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for the viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.

He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him to.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I was ugly.
Do you cry often?
We didn't expect that outcome.
I've already read it.

That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is unseemly.
I get what I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown himself in the bathtub.
Tom and I are the same height.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary's younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes playing cards.
It's a big book.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I think I made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Tom will teach French next year.
I listened to her to the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why is that making you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We're gonna miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her shoulder.
Don't you speak French?
How dare you do that!
This knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
This is a situation I would very much like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never got over it.
Do you want to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning on leaving as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
"Shut your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censorship spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no escape for her.
I'm sorry I didn't do this without you.
Your nose is bleeding.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you do, join me.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been here.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Hurry up or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom isn't leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How can they stand you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd be thirsty.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
Tom didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
The eating of meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
No one loves me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yeah, did you tell him?" "No, he found out himself."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept for the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you were just thinking about something.
Sugar is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like best in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the start signal.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a flaming willow.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river watered the garden.

I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom carried two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to going to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom is in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom is in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pear I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
It's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom has never been late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
Do you still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
It's hard to take you seriously.
Members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the start?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it."
When are you gonna clean up the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do that.
Does it make sense to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried to do that three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom is small but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This sentence is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he's an asshole.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
It's not likely to happen.
I'll order it later.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free all day, and today I'm working.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
The cardboard is tougher than the paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.

Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What action do you expect Tom to take?
She seemed quite calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.

That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.

The traffic inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on my way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Tom was first last time.
It's all different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom will fix that.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long hands.
Tom was wearing sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
What do you think of my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.

Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It's gonna bring disaster to your family.
I was very nervous.

I have to win.
It's no use asking him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to fall asleep.
My mom's really helping me.
Tom has a snake tattooed on his back.
Did you buy meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's this dog's name?
Walk on the sidewalk.

When did you ask her?
I remember Tom.

Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?

If he had followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.

We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with the children.
How's the negotiation going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom has small mustaches.
Do you understand what she said?
You seem distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd rather stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place secure?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face blushed.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
What do you think of your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs were hurting.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't often do that.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Tom walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We were crying.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
Milk can be made of butter, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, remember those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do this if you try.
Have you thought about asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
Nobody's hungry but me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the snowflake feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm gonna fix this.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's a spit.
I really liked that book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she could stay with her tonight.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is it gonna hurt?
The girl was wearing a big red hat.

She didn't buy bread.

You're clearly tired.
We're champions.
Tom is moaning.
Tom said that wasn't enough.

I think you should do that.
Cool!
Don't you want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The Towerblock is in the middle of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We ate fast and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across from me.
The caliber was open.
I brought wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I'm dying to meet you.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?

That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask whether Tom planned to do that or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Because it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are on your street?
Elephant tusks are made of elephant bone.

I turned on my imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I misunderstand you.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.

I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom is watching.
The rain stopped, we could open the windows again.
It's never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom is lost.
I was gonna go out when the phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to right-hand interference.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you like.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a melody siren song to me.
What's it like to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?

Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a big city sex fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted this.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day of work.

Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.

It'll take me too long to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to my summer vacation.
Can I put it differently?
It looks great from here.

I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a slut.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoe size.
I need to think this through.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.

It's your fault it happened.
It's as sharp as a clock.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all the time.
Let's move it.
Let's leave it until tomorrow.
Tom may know more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.

Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has an inherited illness.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.

She's getting married this fall.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easier.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live in rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?

Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
Stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.

I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom only learned how to drive at thirty.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pencil knife.
Honey, I can explain.
You'll soon adapt to the village life.
Keep a bucket of water next to you.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
This river is deeper than anything else.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.

He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."

There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever spoken to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning hits twice in the same place.
I don't brag.
Save it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.

I couldn't help them.
Tom left last.
Tom signed the petition.
Did you try to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Do you want them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
I'm the one who told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a baborab.

Keep me posted.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two stamps at 45 cents, please.
I'll give you a bicycle for your birthday.

I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said it was yours.
Tom is busy with his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's extremely interesting.
Don't stay late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
Tom watches figure skating on TV.
We're gonna have to sleep outside tonight.
Did Tom show Mary how to do that?
Amazing, isn't it?
I made a face.
School's only five minutes away.
Tom put a spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Do you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide her tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good dad.
I'll send you a link.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
How many more people know about this?
I squinted.
We didn't meet in Paris.
Any volunteers?
I told her I wasn't interested.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
People often complain about the weather.
I just need you to sign this.
I felt something was wrong.
Tom swallowed a beer.
