White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black pawn on h4 - mate!
White: a1, pawn on b6, king on c8 Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites put a rival in the position of a6 and then blacks have only two options: take a6 or move an elephant to any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the pawn from b6 to b7 and put a mat. In the second case, whites take a black pawn to a7 with the same result.
