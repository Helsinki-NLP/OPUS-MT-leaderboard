Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well and cry and call in nature has begun to pull people wide and wide around the world.
"You have the ice-cream eye, I need Iceland," says a woman out there in the big world in the comments we made on the announcement from the Marketing Army of Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another attendant will say goodbye to Iceland in the heart of all eternity and a young woman says that she must come as first to Iceland's end is her fiancée there.
However, in the United States, in any case, she is unhappy and expects to have to wait for some month to come.
One more attendant asks if the path to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story of whether it comes from another time.
Egil Tjordur in Peel's advertising room, which was created in conjunction with the international advertising room M & C Saatchi, says the receptors have been hoped for further.
"I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been going very well but this new campaign is already starting to hit the mark.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it's getting foreign media to mount the campaign, and it's been going incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received around seven hundred media all over the world, bringing together rich two billion people.
The value of this coverage is estimated at 1.8 billion krona.
It's not awful. "
The primary market is the United States of America, and the campaign has gone very well, even though the Americans are not going to the country in a hurry.
That the story of Egils has known a market area such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also taken good note, such as Russia, which is surprising.
There were reactions from other areas, such as India, which were not specifically listed.
"These announcements have travelled far more than we expected," says Egill, but it may be that over four million people may have looked at the subject on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The pictures here at the opening took the year Sejberg, the photographer of the Morning Paper, to take on the advertisements that will read the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of the last month.
The roofs were wide and broad, as in the schools in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjöran, in the forest house, in the building of the sun, and in the cave of the head of the heart.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki the son of Peter, and Gunnar the son of Paul the son of Olaf, of Skoti production, and the captain of the Godfather.
In the roles of the testament were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Many ISLANDS were published but at the same time as recordings were recorded in the South, there was a second group in the West and the West.
According to the story of Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first member of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but a winter campaign is planned in collaboration with M & C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for Iceland," says Egill and adds that the collaboration with M & C Saatchi has been doing terribly well.
"It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign collaborators with knowledge of the limits to which we are talking. "
Exploding: Talk about the position on the labour market, the living population and many more
The Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, who was nominated to be in Sprengisand, which starts at 10: 00 a.m. today at the Beetle.
He is also the Minister of Labour and talks about the position on the labour market as such, the Iceland Air case and more cases.
He also talks about rural areas and transport works out in countries that have gone bad and have been distributed over the past years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolf's son, the chairman of VR, will also participate in the project, but he will discuss his report on the investment of the Lifecycle Society and will present ideas about the withdrawal of the labour movement and job creators from the control of the seas to reduce the risk of adverse effects.
Then shall they speak to Ivar the son of Ingimar, the servant of the east, and to the daughter of John, the governor of the market of the north, concerning the place of the service of the land.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading announcement of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10: 00.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in the youth of each type.
But she was famous for her game as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the Sabrina: The Teenage Witch together with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
A little has been applied to her since then, but she was given the opportunity to look over the road and speak about Clueless in a vision of love in the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she's been a great person.
"I have to admit that I built the person most powerful on girls that I met in schools that weren't good to me.
As soon as I read the script I knew who this person was, "Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police post after night arrest
About fifty cases came on the scene of the police in the Capitol today and says in the journal of the police that the cases have been varied.
The day of the police station in the District Court began by the fact that police officers had to have a transfer from a man who had then recently been released from a prison cell after having stayed there because of a drunken driving.
If the man didn't want to leave after he was released, he wouldn't listen to the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man won an ongoing stay at the police station because of his progress.
A man was then arrested in the early morning year of suspicion of breaking and entering a company in Kopavogi.
Law enforcement also had to be replaced by two men in the Breidholt because of reports of physical assault.
Then came also that a woman who sat at the mall in Copavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A theft was also reported in the centre of town this morning.
The driver of the white Renault envoy looked at her for a while, and she was then taken with her free hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Glades - The Horrible Destiny of the Glades
This theory has caught a flight on the Internet that curses over the show about the Happy Corps, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the days and became the third main player of the show to let his life go way before his age.
The elements of the cheerfulness (e. g. Glee) are a friendly sequence of songs, dance and joy.
The factions of the so-called joy of young people in high school, their love and their destiny.
It was not always taken out with pleasure to be in the cheerful band but through singing and dance seemed the person of the parties to overcome every situation that occurred in their lives.
But outside of the theatre, great misery has ridden over the actors and the employees of the subjects, so much so that theories have awakened that the curse of the subjects rests on the subjects.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the part of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the show had run out, Rivera went to have Ryan Dorsey the actor and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and returned them after that.
Dorsey, however, refused to make a plea and was the domestic member of the family let down.
On the 8th of July last, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found asleep in a rescue ship on board the boat, and he could tell the police department that he and his mother had stung himself to swim and then Rivera had put him back on the boat but never left himself there.
Started looking forward to Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area saw that we had been looking since Rivera had been drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found officially dead.
It is believed that she has suffered a great deal of flooding in the water, and a new one of her last demands to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football man with the angel path, who played the key role in bringing the Joy Corps to the road and respect.
But beyond the factions, Moneith rubbed off to a personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had slipped on drugs and was hard to get away from it.
In 2013, his co-workers were found in the projects enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to be looking the better way.
Only two months after the end of the treatment, Moneith was found dead in the hotel room after having gone out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a fatal mixture of ingredients and alcohol.
It was not considered that there was a willingness to do so.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability for a gift had been reduced so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 when he gave his life.
His death was heavy on his associates, but his adversary, Lea Michele, was determined to continue to take on the subjects, and sanctified them the whole part of the memory of Moneith and his person's existence.
Mark Wayne Salling went with the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the shows, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and bore little respect for his colleagues in the Joy Network, or even until he got the nerve to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles under suspicion of child pornography.
At his house, there was a huge amount of child pornography and the case was asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling was already there.
He was accused and convicted of his crimes.
He had four to seven years in prison, as well as having to keep a record of sexual offenders and seek treatment for the child.
Before the judge had determined the sentence, Salling, who was free from insurance, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors that fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013, only 41 to age.
At the show, a woman also worked by the name of Nancy Mates.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts, and she didn't wear her sister's fair story, but she sued Roberts about great governance and disrespectful performance.
Mates took her own life in 2014, but she slipped into severe depression.
She left a letter for her fiancée, where she told her mother and sister, among other things, that she was responsible for what happened to her.
"My mother and so-called sister receive nothing from me but the memory that it was they who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her mediators alone and exodus at the scene of the shooting and having a superb constellation.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the 2012 show.
He was arrested and charged for drunk driving in 2019, which took a lot of nerve.
Heather Morris, the actress, had a major role in the show.
It was the year 2010 when unplugged computer trackers got in naked pictures of her and appeared on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the shows and had a love relationship outside the shows.
Benoist later found out that Jenner had been abusing her in the connection.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and die.
It is also endlessly possible to do with the flowers as the sink photographer Anna Kubel points to.
Just having a moment with the kids in the park is something that never gets forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the ferrets, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after the 10th grade
"I don't think we have many sailors working in the schools of the country," says Axel Eagle, the son of Guðmundson, who is at sea in the summer, but learns psychology at Håskola Island over the winter season. "
Beach hunting is a very pleasant summer job when you're in college.
If you fish well, you can have a good catch, and I think it's great to be able to get rid of taking lessons.
The teapots are also good for me in the winter, "says Axel Eagle, the son of Guðmundson, 25 years old, who is at sea in summer, as in the past summer.
Axel was just about to dock at Tálknabðður when a reporter spoke of him late at night at the beginning of the week. "
"The knowledge that I was in the tenth grade I took command rights for boats that are under 12 meters long and I bought my boat summer after I finished basic school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer ever since.
I bought the boat from my acquaintance, the son of Hartman John, and I made the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being sea and he was very happy when he saw the boat bearing his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, "says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer but the other half at the end of summer when I had been fishing.
Therefore I had the boat without debt at the end of this first summer of my summer upon him. "
But how could a kid have a million and a half dollars to pay out on a boat when he had a newly completed elementary school?
"I had laid aside and collected money, I had been working with my father to sea when I was a boy, I was all summers to hunt with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat. "
Axel is born in Isafird, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
"I can hunt here in the west because I have a law residence with my grandmother at Isafrður.
I learned in this area here for the west of rowers with my dad.
I will go between afar off, according to my condition: for this hunting place shall be over all the west.
Although I think it's best to be in the West, I've also been around the Snaffellsnänd and beyond.
I have also given before the south but then rather weeping, "says Axel, who always robs one fire hour in the morning and sometimes says he talks to the moon and sings to the sky, in one hour together on the bowls.
"The network out on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to chargers and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid falling into a trap, but there has been a certain amount of weather, but never a great risk, "says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the day of work depends on how the fish go every time.
"In the boardhunt I am never more than 14 hours at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the barnyard, but then I have been continuous for a day and a half in the bait on the sea to hunt."
The beach hunting team says he's allowed to hunt 770 kilos a day, which he thinks is a bad thing.
"Other inhibitions are that I may not hunt Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, this four months of beach hunting, in May, June, July and August.
In my judgment, sailors should choose their days of hunting according to weather, and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to calm men instead of having 48 days over the summer and can choose according to their head.
So the zoning could also go for my sake, and a watershed that is well placed with the fish should be allowed to enjoy it, "says Axel, who draws the greatest drought from the salt of his sea on his beach-hunting, but also only a rude and isolated species of river.
Axel works over the winter with the college at the Nupi School in Kopavogi.
"I don't think we have many sailors working in the schools of the country," says Axel proud and adds that he only intended to work temporarily at the school.
"I'm stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that the psychology school will benefit me at the school stage in the future, "says Axel, who also has a long history of business science.
An error in recording prevented homecoming
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country had to make sure that an individual, resident here on the country, was not called back in an audition.
There is no requirement to enter a numeral if you fill out the delete sheet in English, as is the case when done in Icelandic.
"This will be looked at this week," says a specialist in the field of antiquities.
There were three domestic cases of viral infection in the National Hospital last night.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15th, two days after the rules of so-called homemitism came into effect.
Those who lived in Iceland are appointed to come to the land, and are again invited to show four to five days later.
On the other hand, on the Tuesday news of the RUV, the person concerned had gone after the old system.
The pathogen on the border was negative, and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of antiquities, says in a conversation with the news office that this may be a mistake in the electronic record sheet.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they are not required to insert a numeral similar to that in the Icelandic version.
It has been thought of first and foremost for foreign travellers.
Therefore, the person concerned has not received an automatic invitation to show up.
Kamilla says many have, however, been following rules of homecoming even though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been awake for sending people back to the country.
"This will be looked at this week how to make it easier for people to access this to raise their awareness of the process."
The man is in solitary, and six have been put in the hospital.
They all go for a show, but two were starting to show symptoms.
Disinfecting is now underway with the three infections detected yesterday, which are mostly closed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variety of the coronucleus virus that has not been found here before.
In the second instance, the ties have become clear that Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
There are now a total of 15 units of COVID.
135 are in a state of emergency.
Four of five infections unconnected
Five inland areas have been identified here in the last few days.
Of these, four are unconnected and are not yet able to identify the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup gym yesterday.
Emulsion is still ongoing.
Originally, the third twenty were sent to the hospital, but they were reduced to sixteen.
The total number of infections is 34 due to these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that the infection is detected in sports events and has raised questions as to whether such events do not exist.
Johann K. Johann's son, Director of Public Protection, says so perfectly, as long as people follow standards and rules.
"We are constantly breaching for all those who live here that it needs to maintain individual infectors.
We also need to tell people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to be followed.
Then it is possible to have an event, "says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent contamination by keeping the air of individual infectors.
The rules and criteria are there in addition to a permanent review.
"What needs to be done, and what the General Protection Department and the National Medical Service are constantly breaching for people, is to consider these individual infectious agents.
Both homeboys and so on at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents contamination from continuing, "says John.
"We need to bridge for people to continue on the good road that we were on, in order to keep up the success that we have achieved here."
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The throat was exposed to sudden breathing difficulties due to chronic viral infections.
Diabetes was reported on the mortality certificate as a underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that it will not happen again.
Reuter's news service says fear Brumfield doesn't mean he doesn't have a reason.
The number of recent studies by the US authorities shows that 40% of those with diabetes 2 were killed as underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the ratio increases by half.
A study of the United States CDC (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the Cronus virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious specialist, says the results are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
It was hidden in the slow growth of Reuters, allowing research to be carried out and indicating the answers of the 12 states that responded to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona and Kolumbia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already a child of slow growth.
Now COVID - 19 has broken in against as a powerful age, "Reuters after Elbert Huang, head of the Centre for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes is more common among black people and people of southern American origin, who have also gone worse out of the Cronus virus.
The only best way to protect people with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in a splatter with exercise, a low diet and the help of health care professionals.
However, the coronary virus cycle has caused many difficulties in keeping the route.
A high amount of insulin has been used to keep going to work and the risk of being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the United States authorities may have been aware of the risk that may be posed by the virus by those with diabetes 2.
At the time of the SARS cohort virus in 2003, about 20% of the patients had the disease, and at the age of swine fever in 2009, this group was at a higher risk of hospitalisation for three times.
In 2012, when MERS did so, a study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to surgery had diabetes.
Charles S. Del Cruz scientist at Yale University says that because of the effect of the COVID-19 virus, the plague may have worn the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, President of the international community of diabetic patients.
Physicians have advised that the chronic viral load could lead to an increase in diabetic complications including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Just as recent studies to allow the chorovirus to lead to an increase in the incidence of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to distinguish the relationship between the Cronus virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already sick in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high proportion of glucose and lipid in diabetic patients may produce a likely "cellular storm," as it is called when the immune system fails too hard and attacks the body.
Shaped cells may also lead to inflammation, which may lead to a return of fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"This is connected to everything inside."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, and they left the room."
The wives of Ásrún Magnusdóttir and Atli Bolson became the unusual bone from the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for the work that the artist was putting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Therefore, Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and his mother, Ásruu Magnús daughter, for the first time.
"I was very happy with her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but then she also thought it was unheard of.
And I'm still sorry, "he says.
Ásrún can also remember that the husband will tear up his first meeting regularly.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last only on the weekend, "says the one who also learned to be the husband at first appearance.
"I felt and felt so much excitement around Atla, which I love.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I got excited about it. "
Atli says the wives have put emphasis on it in their relationship to go their own way.
"We bind our backs not the same knots and hauliers.
We avoid the routes that we tell around us. "
There is a possible reason why they took the business of Ragnar Kartansson's photographer only rejoicing, although that would be less than usual.
"Our mutual friend Kristin Anna is coming to see us and asking if we can come to the desert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörga's wife Ragnar, on Snapps."
They received the commandment, met the trifle on Snapps, and had a dessert and a dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for a picture show that he thought he'd set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
"He had a multi-grayed video work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way. "
Ásrún says that he has described the work as banal and decadent from the everyday life of Western Europe.
"He had sketches of all the tendons that he was going to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in."
The last time Ragnar asked the couple to participate was to show young interns to love in a minimalist room.
"These are intercourse with the beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple didn't know much about Ragnar even though they knew about him and him "but they knew us and found us fit in this.
They had a saying that they didn't want to advertise people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who got sexual satisfaction from performing for others. "
They raked Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we ran out of Snapps, we said," Aren't we just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team, "says Ásrún and Atli.
"This is about love and love"
Senan was taken to a nice apartment on the Mörargån.
There was a very sophisticated film studio; a photographer, Ragnar and a sound artist and a couple.
After having been on tape, all the rooms left to wait in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We hadn't decided what we should be like.
We got some instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and who we were doing for.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated, "says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli and Ásrún.
"We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris. "
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
"When Tommi saw this, he wept, and thought it so beautiful," says Atli.
"This is just as much about love and love as it is about self-intercourse," says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother has heard the voice of the son of the Art Collection Reykjavík and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts pounding in this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't said anything like that, but then my dad just sent me a message saying, "Nice to run into the little family in Palais de Tokyo," and Ásrún tore up.
And do you think the participation in the work has been a deep connection between Asruda and Atla?
"At least we're still together, so maybe something went down.
At any rate, this deepened my relationship with the family, "says Ásrún and laughing.
The work of Ásrún himself in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I felt a little difficult not being with you, but someone else," she says, turning to the husband.
"But it was nice to see this because this is only one late in a much bigger pain and when you saw this with the other effects, this is very nice.
I could do something to get away from it, and I was just proud.
And there was little beans in my stomach, "says Ásrún, who was pregnant by another child of the wives when the tendon was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them Asrúna and Atla in the Love Tales of Council 1.
Swansea with a win in the previous subtitle

Sendiheralously for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador in Iceland, is in the caste of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to have a armed bodyguard where he was afraid of his life.
However, the President of the United States has not been so tired of ordering the envoy here on the land.
From the fact that Carol Van Voorst was appointed to the post of Ambassador of the United States of America in April 2009, the country has been completely without charge for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst was appointed in exceptional circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have been given the Fálka word.
Following a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President's office stating that she would not be honored with the word.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came into office, in September 2010.
There may be some evidence that Robert S. Connan had been ordered to be the sender, but then he stopped.
At the end of the job, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service about a decade ago.
He then left the post of the autumn of 2013 and took over the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another sendiheraless period.
Robert Barber agreed to the US Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but then no envoy had been present for 13 months.
Barber was political but not diplomatic, but he had served as a lawyer and short election of Barack's Obama.
He left office as soon as Donald Trump took over from the presidency, January 20, 2017, as usual with a political-ordered envoy.
Trump's management was unusual in ordering both senders and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration system.
So two years before the United States Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him out the questions and confirm at the end of the mission to Iceland.
In his testimony he said that he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was killed, had been of Dutch crime.
Gunter is a political officer who was previously a dermatologist in California and has been involved in the Jewish community of the Republika class, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Sheldon Adelson, the gambling owner, started a merger, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald's Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no envoy had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest thing in the world.
The reason for both the length of Trump's management was to nominate people in key elements as well as, in the past year, the work of the United States Congress has been very slow, including the confirmation of the senders in office.
From 2009, therefore, a total of five years has been left empty in Iceland.
However, it has not prevented the implementation of the route of the sending council that opened a new headquarters at Engjeteg.
The operations are estimated to cost around 6.5 billion, but the hubs cover the building and the bulkhead glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current sender's security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for armed bodyguards.
A former player in IBV suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former player of IBV, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he will be looking after his return to the country.
This appears in an interview with Tonny, who appears on the Austrian Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Ugandan Police FC team that plays in the top department of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here on land, but he played with IBV, Val and Grott in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland I did not play in the middle as I was used to playing.
The leader of the team was in that position, but he also had the number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted, "says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the game with IBV.
Among Tonny's speeches is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players have when they play in Europe.
"This came to me once, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Then I heard of the matter, and I asked my friend what it was all about.
He told me then that my adversary had made a racial appeal against me after I had given him thanks. "
In 2014 Tonny went from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he's made the mistakes he sees most of all.
Tonny couldn't get to the front team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the country.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined them at Val.
"It was a mistake to come to Iceland again on a loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway then I would have had the opportunity that I wanted, "says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to point out that the loan to Iceland has been made out of his dreams of getting to the top of the European scale.
Found worms in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 m long black worm in the neck of a woman who was looking there.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with a tooth.
A study showed that parasites were involved.
CNN will tell you.
The woman had eaten Sashimi a few days before, which is the thin flesh.
The woman recovered soon after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi went to bed in Western countries, cases where parasites have been carried into people have increased to the history of CNN.
Fear of other waves starting in Europe
The SPA is now on the verge of worrying about the second wave of the European Cronus virus, where government has taken steps to halt the spread of the Cronavirus virus.
In Catalonia, all the fun life has been on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action for the spread of infectious diseases in Spain, but in the United Kingdom, everyone has to go to the hospital at their arrival from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of travelling to Spain.
The infection is also increasing in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance between halting the spread of the virus and returning to economic life.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to other parts of the world, but the incidence of infection in the world is approaching 300 thousand a day, which is the highest rate of contamination in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has been confirmed to be 16 million on a global scale, according to the John Hopkins High School, and are deaths confirmed to be 644 000 associated with the virus.
The Mosaic works of Art finally get to enjoy their own to the fullest
In front of Tollhus in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There's a big grave there, too.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the footprints are good, and there are many stables, and they respect the work of millions of mosaic flashes - as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it's not worth it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it was a parking lot that was always handled.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their business in the middle of town.
"Viable and diverse public spaces" and "adaptive urban tastes" are a guide to the redesign of the Security Watch that is now over.
The goal is to celebrate the area and allow the Mosaic of the Art of the Holy Daughter at Tollhuset to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work will be square and as the area is well situated at the sun, it is thought to be suitable for hibernation for road users.
The work of the art will be revealed and the material will now enjoy it better than before on this 142-square metre surface.
In the area there will also be a small "fog-spray," some kind of water sculpture, which offers a game and gives the area a certain hiding place.
In this way, the replacements are described by Reykjavíkurborg, which is being carried out in conjunction with Vetus.
Water-wetting, heat-heating and electricity-generating processes are being rebuilt.
Many of them have come to their years, but the school and the caldars are from the year 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the middle of the century.
When the street is reopened at the end of the operation, cars can drive around it again.
But she will be a single street and as soon as she's created a calmer and accessible space for walking.
In the fraternity of Tollhuset on the website of the Customs Director says that the house was taken into use in 1971, but its architect was Gisling Halldórsson.
Because of the damage caused by the fire, 250 meters of window-free walls were formed on the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such surfaces would have a detrimental effect on the overall street environment, if no special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
Some of them agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art set up there.
At this time there was a great deal of the work of the daughter of the sanctuary, an artist, says in the summary.
Had she worked very hard on mosaic pain in Germany and beyond.
The agreement was to contact her first before deciding whether or not to compete for the job.
Often it had been said that the work would have to reflect life at the harbour, yet the remains had been the life of Reykjavík since it was made.
When talking to the artist, she had to trax the idea of such pain.
It had to be agreed that she got drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the suggestions abroad.
A man got the time she decided to need herself, and when she returned home she made a few suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed immediately to ask her to do the job.
Even though it was hoped to make a total agreement with her and the famous art industry in Germany, the Oidtmann brothers, Gerd had long worked with them to set up famous art works across Europe.
The contracts were concluded, and Gerður won the work of art in the factory of his brothers, who then took care of the work of the Tollhuset.
All the work was exceptionally well done, both by the half of the Sheol daughter and by the brothers of Oidman, says in the summary.
Since then, it has stood unabated Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to work the work, which was done and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
The listwoman died two years after the Tollhusarket was completed, only 47 years old.
Underpinning the transfer of more plants to the country
The Minister for Social Affairs of Einar Daðson says that more public institutions will be transferred to the country next door.
This is what the Secretary of State said on the show "Splendsandi" at the Beetle at noon.
A recent report on the transfer of the Burning Area of the Housing and Human Activation Agency to the North in the autumn of Southeast Africa was reported.
Six specialists in the field of fire-fighting work at the Agency but none of them are expected to follow the Agency in the north and have been reported by the National Association of Disabled and Disabled Transporters to report on the transport of livestock.
"I think we should step further in this entity.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
"More transport," said Asmandur.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of the public institutions around the country.
"I think it is necessary to take further political decisions on the transfer of public services to land, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency," said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other agencies that have been transferred to the land and exchanged great importance for community on the land, such as the transfer of Food Agency to Selfoss, Agriculture Iceland to Akraness and job security on Skagastranden.
All the best from the second day of Masteramot
94. The State of Iceland's Championships in the Liberation of Horsesvelli in Akureyri today.
Some resistance was set up on the second day of the race.
It was calculated with exciting competition in the cast of women on Thörsvelli, but Vigdi Jonsdotter from FH put Islandsmet in the cast of 2014 which stood until Elisabet Rut Rúnarsdotter from IR improved the rating in May last year.
Vigdi's won the Islandsmädet back earlier in the summer and has been in fantasy up the last time, but she has tripled the islandsmätet what is of summer.
Elisabet Rut has been rubbed by injury and failed to reach a line today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25,69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw everyone at the longest of this day, or 60.08 metres in her last attempt, and immediately resisted.
Her ice cream patch she used to put in July is 62.69 meters and she was, however, somewhat from there.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrimsdóttir from IR had the second best throw of the day, but she added her best success with a throw up to 50.18 metres.
In a man's class, the FH, Hilmar Eagle Jonsson, the Icelandic Methafar, won the battle safely, but he threw 73.84 metres in his last throw, and set up a fight.
His ice land in the branch is 75.26 meters.
The God of the Son of God, the Olympion, and the Methites of Iceland in a round place, won a competition in a coals in Thordsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in a round place which is his principal province.
The ice strip of the God of Vals is 65,53 metres, but he threw a maximum of 59,13 metres today and secured himself the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendson threw away the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that lasted in the second seat, 49.43 metres.
Hafdi's daughter Sigurðsdottir, the Icelandic Methar in a long jump, won the long jump with superiority, but Hafdi's jumped at a maximum of 6.25 metres today, which is about 40 cm from her country.
In 200 metres of a woman's race, it was the IR-ingre Guðbjerg Jonah Bjarnadottir, who was a brat, but she came to the ground in 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandic kingdom in the branch is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jonah was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 meter race and in a 4 x 100 meter race and then also in a 4 x 400 meter race today.
In the male class, Kolbeinn Håðr Gunnarsson from FH was first in the field in the 200-metre run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Olliver Mána Samuel's son from Årman.
Like Jonah's Gudbergh, Kolbeinn won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters run.
Can't get a ticket for 27 million crown Bitcoin crop
The Committee of Experts has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who was required to be guilty of defamation of his financial obligations arising from the sale of Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that a tax investigator would not have given a clear answer as to why he had to be found guilty.
The Committee's findings show that the tax investigator considered that the person has a clear understanding of the material incorrect tax figures for the 2016 and 2017 years.
He had miscalculated his financial resources that had come about because of the sale of the Bitcoin battery up to 27 million, either voluntarily or out of a massive incompetence.
A guilty man's town for his pride.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he was able to sell electricity coins for 27 million in 2016.
He would have had a grave in the years 2009 and 2010 when such a thing would have been both easy and expensive with an ordinary home address.
Then he suggested that when he sold the coins, tax execution for such sales had been very unclear and unpredictable.
It would have been possible for public citizens to be aware of such tax rulings.
He would not have been able to avoid paying tax from the crop and had made an account of his property on a premise as an institution on a mortgage account.
He would have asked both the acquaintances and the governor how this was done, but without success.
Then he thought he would need to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to present himself with complicated rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear view of.
The man thought it was right that his taxes for these two years would be redetermined and imposed, but otherwise no punishment.
He then claimed that he was working in Iceland and had been paying taxes here on land since 2012.
He never intended to get away from his duties inadvertently.
The demand for guilt would be from all sides and would plunge him into debt.
Brymylov speaks up, "This man understands what a football is."
Brynjölf Andersen Willumsson has been significant between the teeth of the people but has also aroused an impression of his progress with the wider view of the Pepsi Max division.
Blisters will be in the fire line tonight when they receive IA in direct transmission at State 2 Sport.
Brynjøv takes out the game ban because of the four reviews of the season and therefore does not come to play with a new haircut as in the games of the summer until now.
He had had written "blah, blah, blah" on his head before the game at HK's last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know who exactly he was answering with the favor, but speaking of character then this was rather than trying in the game.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if it was someone who was going to get this game right then I thought he would do it or make it, "said the Guðmundur Benedikson of the Pepsi Max maid, when he was believed to be Brynjóf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's hard sometimes to figure out what position he is.
He looks out a little bit on the left when it comes to going to the game, but he has a very free roll in the team, "said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Torkell Mani Pétursson says Brynjólf's real fun power and is pleased to have such a colourful man in the department: "No one shares the fact that this is character.
This is a fun type and I love it with my hair, and being ready to always come and answer interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people occupied by him, telling me that this man understands what a football is.
"I'm a fun force.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it. "
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjóf, people are paying their way in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius, "said Moni.
Player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in touch with some of the team in the B-division"
Tobias Thomsen, actor KR of the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish centre of Bold Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Fotbolti.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the period in the homeland, but to do so he first has to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish division begins before that Icelandic possibility.
The partner knows I miss Danmarkk and has shown me a great understanding, "said Tobias in conversation with Bold.
"I've been in touch with some of the members of the B division and will probably switch before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with KR. "
Then he says that he needs to take on a pay cut in Denmark.
"Folks in Denmark have probably felt more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
The wheel whisperer Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - now responding to the DV's coverage
For a year or so, Bjartmar Leosson has had an interest unlike most others.
He cleans up, and saves lost and stolen wheels, electric bicycles, and handbags.
Has the Bjartmar earned the name "the wheel whisper" for the week.
Yesterday, when a man published a story about his communication with Bjartmar, he became so much of a stranger.
Then DV visited the Facebook group Western cities where it was found that Bjartmar had taken the man speaking on the East Bank and said the creature could possibly be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original texts of the electric pilot but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
These texts have now been changed on Facebook and the prediction of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original story of the case is not at all illustrative of what really went on yesterday in Eastern Ireland.
Bjartmar was said to have received information from the victim of an electric missile stables that these were indeed their electric missiles.
The information received from other owners, but the information proved incorrect, says Bjartmar.
"I looked to the guy and I checked at the shuttle, ending with information that there were electric skis that had been missing for a very long time and were looking for it.
Well, I had a hard time first, but when I saw him getting ready to go to the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was certain in his fault, and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I'm doing very well in such matters, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken off my word. "
Bjartmar says that the man on the shuttle has immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and has called the police himself.
"Yeah, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric car proved ownership of his electric car and left.
Later the right owner said the electric car from his story on Facebook, as in previous news.
In this year's bed that Bjartmar has spent some time on this process, he says he can count the changes that he fell into the corner of people on his fingers on one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men of Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that the racketeers are the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, figs, psychopaths and other people who are for some part on the street.
"The pussy is a hard master, and somehow it needs to finance the next dose, because unfortunately it is stolen on such a free farm easy to achieve," says Bjartmar.
"My relationship with these people is really so good that I have come with many of the good people with me in the team.
Examples are that people have been treated and joined and then sought me and helped me with what I am doing, "he says.
In general, Bjartmars is connected to the people of the Ancestors on polite nights.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peace to show him receipts, statues, and so forth.
Riding wheel theft is a major problem that has not been addressed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to point out that people should talk to him about the chairs.
There is a lack of harmony with the previous DV press release and it says that it is not some sort of self-ordered police officer looking for justice personally.
Asked if he has not yet come to the bottom of the ice with his work, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, says Bjartmar so certainly be.
"Of course the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are not doing this.
I have to look up police officers driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is pure and pure said ruthless in these matters. "
"When the police are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve success in this class, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in having on chairs, that sometimes he runs on his "shelters" on the street that they have only corrected the Bjartmar bikes that they had previously gotten into.
The changes that Bjartmar has called after the help of the police have occurred that she simply does not show up.
"This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not the property of the trucks to teach," said Bjartmar, and I'm sorry that the victim of the wheel thief has to suffer from the emptiness of the police in this class.
Bjartmar's success is not shared.
How to find stories of people thanks to Bjartmari for having reached their possessions again.
By itself, Bjartmar has long since lost the number of wheels he has given, but the amounts run on millions, if not millions.
The weight of the electric purse, the electric bicycle and the electric scooter is heavy, but the electric bicycle can cost less than half a million.
There is a day-to-day service for the children of the children, and every other weekend he works together.
His fury is therefore an unpaid work which he does in his leisure time.
Lifeyrys and long shadows
The year 2019 was a major year of birth in the history of the Icelandic Republic of Life.
In 1919, officials had received a reward from the king of Dana from all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919, they were established by the government of the Republic of Libya, which ended up with the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the People's Republic of China.
The basis for the current life-cycle population of the general wage was then established with all-armed nuclear agreements on the labour market in 1969, where a report was made on the employment-related life-cycle population with a mandatory membership and a full-fledged collection from the beginning of the year 1970.
In 1974, laws were then established on the basis of these contracts, and the life-cycle system continued to increase thereafter.
The living system of the wage-earners was not the only radical change in the labour movement of the 20th century with its core structure.
Unemployed security had been similar in the history of industrial activity in 1955, and it also gradually received its demands for sick and ill-treated rights, severe leave rights, reduction of working hours, improvements in housing and more such things as a great deal of change.
All these rights were high and hard to fight but were, after considering, much higher and more permanent core than the increase in the wages in the wage bill, which disappeared equally hard in the high price of the post-war period and up to 1990 as a whole.
The respondent that the establishment of the General Lifecycle Society in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although men finally came together that the sailors would be in the hands of a social partner, the workers' movement would be that their managers should have appointed representatives of employers and social partners to the same extent.
In the next few years after the Seafood Foundation, the demand for the majority of workers in the management of the Seafarers was often discussed in the unions, but she never made it, and so we still sit up with the abnormal provision that the representatives of the Seafarers are not in the majority in the control of the Seafarers.
Article 36 (1) of Regulation No 129 / 1997 on the protection of the financial interests of the Member States and the functioning of the financial interests of the Member States provides for an investment policy.
It says in the first speech that "a living animal should have the advantage of a marine partner as a guide."
Also says in the fifth recital, "A living animal shall set itself a moral standard in investments."
The following measures are included in the Lifeyris region's main components of the business, in the continuation of the previous legal provisions:
The Lifeyri region is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on the responsibility of investments, together with many of the largest living regions and Western and European industry investments.
The rules set out how environmental and social concerns, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to the improvement of investment performance in the value-added tax collection.
This brings together the benefits of investment and the goal of society in a wider context.
LV considers it important that societies, especially those registered on the share market, set public policy on: maintaining good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gulf of Gildi, which has the largest rivers of the land, has set itself a "policy of responsibility for investments" and there are decisions of the same kind.
This is all torn up here as an entrance to the new title of Icelandic, "Shadow Management."
Since it is new in the case, it is not expected that it has been defined as a liability, but I believe that the following definition now appears to be "most taken": shadow management is that when a foreman in the company says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the company in charge of the life cycle, or instructions on how to take a position in specific matters.
If they fail to comply with the recommendations, they will be left out of control at first sight.
However, if the foreman does not carry this in the media and does not talk about reparations, then it is not "shadow management" end up being such a relationship between men, of course, in the world of finance as elsewhere.
I'll let the reader think about how he feels "shady."
In particular, there are two people who have tried to accept this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
These are the lords of the son of Eggisson, in the newspaper, and in the book of Asgeir the son of Jonson, a banker.
The title of both of them was after Bogi Nils Bogason, President of the Icelandic Air Agency, had announced that his intention was to tear apart the agreements of the company with flight crew and flight attendants (denounce them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolofson, the President of the Verslingsmannafélag Reykjavíkur, sent them the orders to the representatives of the company in charge of the Lifeyrissojod merchants to not support the possible purchase of the sea on the part boards of the company, or to make them known to be relocated.
A few days later, Bogi Nil withdrew his decision, and in the aftermath Ragnar went the same way with his recommendation, which was, of course, based on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hördun and Asgege's reason to discuss the matter in the Friday paper of the Newsletter with great words about shadow management, violation of the law and the need for changes to the law.
There was certainly a small toad to roll over a heavy load, even if the blessed toad had been in contact with and dried out quickly.
As this matter is important, we should consider the substance ourselves in the end.
I was right here before those things in the laws of a life-cycle society that's trying to get to this point.
These include the need for the welfare of the seamen and the moral standards of investments to be respected by the seafarers, and these elements are more closely dealt with in the agreements of both Gildis and the Lifeyris merchants, as I mentioned.
However, the living environment should NOT be looked at only at short-term arteriosmids in its investments.
These were very dangerous policies and do not have to look for long-term examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and banks have been made to the moral and environmental communities, with unfortunate consequences.
The head of Iselandair was obviously on ice when he thought of wiping out the whole group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investments.
Which is better, he looked at him and pulled it back.
The time will tell whether it will be enough to ensure that the investment of a living organism in the community can be assumed to be responsible to the social partners at the time of their arrival.

One of the infected didn't have a sense of origin.
One of the three identified with Covid-19 on the land yesterday came to the land from the Eystrasalt Empire on the 15th of July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic who, however, is not living here at present and was not given clear instructions to maintain so-called homemitism after coming to the country and go to another screening a few days after coming.
He got a negative view of the border.
"But he is in the Icelandic community and in fact should go to that conclusion," says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of antiquities at the National Medical Service and the local medical examiner while he is on vacation, in conversation with the Newsletter today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to enter the numeral and if the keynote is not entered then you are not invited automatically in the second view."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad but because of his connection in the country that Iceland would have preferred him to use the Icelandic.
He didn't know about it, though.
"When a textbook is not registered, you will need to search for it yourself to appear in the second display.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way, "says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to increase the information flow on this while we find some way to make an automatic bidding system, although Iceland does not register its ID number.
Or to do so somehow reveal who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system, "she explains.
It is better for the person concerned to have access to the country, even though he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, which is the country of origin.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was detected yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are about to undergo a screening, but two of them have begun to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man was denied from his vision at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he has been recently infected by the virus that she has not yet been identified in him when the sample was taken by the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It's not quite possible to assume that this is safely imported because it's been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two that have caused a little bit of control in connection with the sporting events."
That's what she says, though, that it's very unlikely because of how few people are around here.
"It is in fact very unlikely," says Kamilla, but it states that it cannot be ruled out until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been structured in the man.
"If we get a virus type that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain he brought it to the country."
Pipar spray and detonate against opponents
There was an attack between the police and the protestors in Seattle last night.
The police took the charge of the opponents of Piparsprey, and of the unlethal hand bombs, but the opponents broke the windows, and lit it.
45 defendants were arrested and 21 officers were injured.
Police violence and racial discrimination were strongly opposed in the United States last night, but the Seattle case was for support in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the opponents was shot dead.
Based on the findings of the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands came together in peaceful protests.
The crowd then lit in the building area and broke windows in the courthouse of the city.
In the aftermath, the police said the opposition was undisturbed, and until action came between the groups of opponents and the police.
Looking for justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, 23-year-old black male murdered by police in August last year, was at least by opponents.
A car went through a group of protesters in the city, but no one got hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of soldiers came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, 26-year-old black woman murdered by the police in her home last March.
The group carried a firearm and went to the police station at the end of the street, where the police assigned the group from the group of people who opposed the opposition and also carried a firearm.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where opponents were reminded of James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man murdered by a white bailiff in May.
Sunscreen: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskär, the night manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English Selection Division.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, then Sunshine and his men end up in the fifth seat and then lose the Master's Office seat.
However, they should still hope to get to the National Championship by working the European Union next month.
"We're not at the end of the line.
If we reach a score against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now, "said Sunshine.
"But whatever happens then this is not the end of our journey because we still have considerable land to get the two sides above us," said Sunshine.
It is clear that nervous men will be there at 3: 00 this morning, but Sunshine tried to pretend that every other game was going on.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the period.
This is nothing new, and this is where the company is built.
We have made a great opportunity to end the period well and now it's ours to take advantage of it, "said Sunshine.
"This isn't the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone who's in the football game, the next game is always the most important.
The output does not define our period, we have already had many times that define this period. "
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a great deal for us and I think that we are in a better shape and will be stronger spiritually than in the last period," said Sunshine.
65,000 contamination of the sun ring
The 65,490 new transmission of the Cronus virus was detected in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins High School.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the start of the plague in the country.
900 died from the virus last night, but the last four days before it was more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus.
A total of 146,460 viral deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the CNN report, according to the PIC of the United States, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000-15 August next.
Fear of another storm of the storm
The government of Spain is now trying to keep the sick back from the increased spread of COVID - 19 in the country.
The Spanish health system reported over 920 new cases of COVID - 19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports of this in one day since May and the reports are coming at the same time as the Spanish begin to take off one of the most stringent exit bans in Europe.
The backlash led to the British authorities now having passengers coming from Spain to go to the hospital at the time of their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
This is what is worse in Catalonia in the north-east of Spain, where government has taken over to the wider limits to try to vote for the growth.
In the city of Barselona, the entertainment centres will be closed for the next two weeks and the elves will be closed in the middle of the night.
The exit ban is now in force for 200 thousand people in Segria County in the west of Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision taken by the United Kingdom will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is very concerned about the arrival of foreign travellers and is ill-played after the journey.
Tui, the largest travel office in the United Kingdom, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The government around the world is said to be preparing under the second wave of the storm, but little interest seems to be in reaping to a massive outbound ban which has largely destroyed the economy.
To make a picture, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Britta, has taken such a thing very badly and similar to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, said that the nation "would not be able to live, economically or socially," in the event of a return to an exodus ban in the country.
I hope that a lot of counsellors will be able to keep the virus back in the next cycle if it comes to live in a separate town, city or region.
Five new contamination in Iceland - Three inland
Three landmines were detected yesterday and two more than the border.
This is how five subjects with positive Covid-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In the report of the general public, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP Football Center.
Has it been sent to solitary and sixteen who were in close contact with him in sickness.
The infected person was a participant in the social service in Reykjavík and is according to the report, "only part of the football team" in the hospital.
Others who were sent to the hospital are connected to the person in another way.
The origin of this infection is undetected and a full-time infecting agent of the State Police Commissioner.
The opponents of the ReyCUP have followed the current and appropriate instructions and regulations of the healthcare professional and the general public.
However, images of the resistance were received, where a very close collaboration could be seen to celebrate the good of his team out on the field.
Just before 11: 00 today, the recipients will receive the following message on their Facebook page.
It says "ATH: Parents kindly respect the rules that contestants pick up their own stuff in school.
Parents aren't allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding. "
Another infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported the previous day.
According to the report, "Icelandic genetic testing has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
It is used to infect in this matter as well and is infected in isolation and 12 in a hospital because of the infection.
The third infection from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was detected on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in loneliness and sex who was in close contact with him in sickness.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two countries were identified and the results of further studies were requested, such as a disease-related infection procedure at national level.
Finally, the report says that the National Police Commissioner and the National Medical Service will make sure that they are careful and that they are aware of the individual infections.
The least doubt is whether the signs of the Covid-19 virus are present is that the same person is asked to have a test session at the next health care centre.
Patreksfjörður says the tent area is updated about the shopping weekend - Direct guests other
The tent area at Patreksfird is completed this weekend, according to the report of the West.
Visitors should consider other guest options.
The names of the west coast of Biludal, the Tálknörður, Melanes of the Red Land, the Hotel Flokalund, and the Hotel Breidavík are the second choice in the station.
It is enough for us to be at the PatreCourt this weekend; for as in the past year, the feast of the Icelandic household will be kept in the city.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the city.
For an attempt in the tent area to judge, you can expect good attendance this year, if the weather doesn't put the line in the account, but DV said earlier today from the distant prophecy.
But expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for the Patreks.
The web bb.is first told us, and said that all the other guests in town were already fully booked.
The whole village house is cave down to the best place in the city.
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
While the owners are seeking a new building permit, their business has been in the system for the last three years.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive places in Reykjavík City, there is a large number of houses on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are doors of two stages, each of which holds four rather important apartments.
They're 93-130 square meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a lot of history to keep.
It was erected in 1959 and has among other things raised Viddeoläga, the Shoehouse, the Milk Shop of the Milk Sell, the Joe Gun Mist, the Fish Sell and now the last Höskolaprent.
The house has, so gently to speak, remembered its imbecile more beautiful.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company register of other Magnús Magnúson and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went for the owner of the City and was the defence of the City's property company.
In the group of property owners of the City is Stálskip ehf.
The ship of steel is the investment company of the God of Hosts, the daughter of Laws, and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of the third part of D18 ehf.
And the god and her husband, Águst the son of Sigurðs, went out once to the ship of Steel.
D18 ehf. bought the house summer 2009 and has little to do with it since then.
Tell neighbors that the house has deteriorated steadily since then, though mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook site of the neighborhood, one of the residents says that the house has "not been particularly alive in the last few years."
There may be a record of the owners having a few years' experience after changing the house and the river.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
"It's a long time to do something nice to this spot and sad that this has been pulled out like this."
He also says that he's lost his way into the property of the house because he hasn't driven himself to finish this, found some common space with the neighbor of the house, and stopped this "legal staff."
"Just do this in consultation with society so that you can move on and finish it."
The "Legal Unit" that is currently being prepared is the organisation process of the court that has been in operation at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a hill on the current multi-dwelling house and behind the house, a new elevator and one-floor accommodation in addition to a basement.
The building permit granted for the implementation was selected for the Environmental and Environmental Policy Committee and it fell from its value as the implementation was not supported by an agreement and a detailed presentation was not sufficient.
And the city of Reykjavík went forth with a work of division, and finished it with an announcement at the time of the reign in July last year.
The plan was also well-designed and it was evaluated by the Committee in March 2020.
At this point in time, nearly three years had elapsed from the initial application for building permits and the property of the house at the beginning.
At this time the house had hit down numerically and neighbors were getting tired.
When DV questioned the neighbour of the house in the situation and the reaction of the neighbor, the answers were in various ways.
Some had understanding of the plans of the property of the house, some not at all.
Others were angry at the city, others were not.
Others were just angry, but nothing quite out in anyone.
Yet others said the parking lot was a weasel, but neighbors have reused the unused parking lot Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicle.
One plaintiff in the case said that he was tired of the administration:
"That we should have to go through the process of triangulation is quite incredible.
It is as if Reykjavík city could not read. "
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and undone.
Reminds me of the state of the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of their work which are now at the beginning.
When the reporter wore a garden at Dunhaga 18, he blew a galloping door and garbage heap.
Playstation computer and recent TV were all over another garbage on the ground - victims of glacial summer bleach.
Opað was entered into the old office of Håskolaprenten and there much of cats of the smell to judge.
It is clear that someone has moved around in one corner but no one can see.
Staples of beds and beds, and some boards of earthly pages, which I'm sure you'll be a book, hurry up.
The steps of the house were also open and alive in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky to run into other people.
There was Rumene eating potatoes for dinner and inviting a reporter.
The Romans work for the Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, making sure DV had nothing to pay for the house except heat and power.
Because of the state of the house, it's not defensible to collect rent.
It is clear that because of the mail in the house's door, there have been a number of foreign workers living there at the last loss.
The private sector has not taken part in the Covid-19 situation, yet the agreement in terms of travel has led to agreements in the building sector, and these two sectors have been the most able to take advantage of the services they provide.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough work to do and were devoted to the worksheets and offices in the community to dry out after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable state of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When the reporter called the boys Romanian, the coldness suddenly became clear: at the best place in Reykjavík there are 1,500 square meters of permanent property.
Owner wants to change the house to recovery and neighbors want to improve the state but share the definition of "improved."
Between then, the city's planning team sits on the front row, the victim of no end-of-life claims and the possibility of a girlfriend in the planning process and the vagueness of the waste management committee on environmental and resource issues.
In the house there are such Romanian labourers, perhaps just those who go to improve the condition, when the Islanders stop fighting.
The article appeared initially in the weekend magazine DV 17 July.
In the treatment of obesity following a chronic viral load
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in the campaign against obesity, which will be banned in the case of instant-bite advertising, following his severe weakness, partly because of his weight.
It is said that Johnson will present the campaign, which has been given a better greeting, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe wheelchairs for their shelters in excess of their weight and will also be attacked in the event of an increase in wheelchairs.
The announcement of an instant broadcast will then be banned by 21 o'clock in the evening, according to the British press.
"COVID - 19 has raised us against the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthists, more active and eat healthy foods," according to the spokesperson in charge.
Johnson himself has had a problem with his weight, but he was admitted to medical care when he was infected with the Cronus virus in ours, and it is partly to his weight because he is believed to have been so severely weakened.
Women are better off falling to lead the changes
If she said that the new governance record was the greatest step that the nation could take towards greater distribution of power, efficiency, and the fight against corruption and the overall benefits.
"We need to change a little bit now and who is better off leading that change than the group of society that has to be easier to be in these values.
There are women, "said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their relationship with women.
To stand together and be together to lead changes.
So now it's just us to lead these changes. "
She was said to be somewhat obnoxious about the attack on Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we're not as ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It's a cave.
We need to know where we're from and know the story and listen.
Listen to a row of substandard groups.
We don't all have the same rules here, "said Helga.
The question she said women were in many good things in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Iceland is building at a very high male level.
She said that the administration was turned to form a form of self-interest, superiority and power which were the forces that maintained misconduct in all societies.
"Women have now established this group and come together and are just a little upset that the International People's Party is going to drag past this national vote of 2012," she said.
"It's this female value that we're thinking about.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all sit at the same level realistically, "she said and added that the former value was the basic value of the new management file.
"We are a very rich country with natural resources and it is ridiculous that here are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change different ways, "said Helga.
"It's ridiculous that there's some natural law that women's jobs are always lower paid.
It is ridiculous that pilots and nurses need to end up in a nuclear battle just to earn human wages. "
The signature list for a new control file can be signed here through the Icelandic electronic database.
Trying to rob a walking road driver downtown.
You were arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened walking road users and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the manufacture of narcotics in Årbær where two were arrested for the cause.
Then the police stopped the motorcycle driver in the Hides where it was at 146 km speed with a maximum speed of 60 km / h.
In addition, he had previously been passed on to driving rights.
The police in the Capitol had enough to turn around this night and were over 80 cases registered in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
At that time, there was a lot of noise reports for the same reason.
On Saturday, 11 reports of the same noise-like behaviour were reported and received a lot in the police diary.
On the other hand, last night, 22 noise issues occurred on the scene of a police officer.
Six were in a prison cell last night.
In the years, police officers were called up tonight when a member of the crew shot planes in the air.
However, they had escaped when police officers were in the yard.
Then nine drivers were stopped before the drinking, and and before the driving of drugs.
Four were arrested for fighting in the middle of the night, but one of them was in a prison cell.
And two were carried away in the midst of the city after they fell on their faces, and the other in the middle, and the other in the west.
One was transferred to an accident unit after he was injured by jumping on trampoline in Kopavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a wheel cap on Klarlarnesi yesterday.
According to the police diary, the wheel equipment was in "very bad condition" and it was frozen.
You can stay at Monet's house about the shopping weekend
The house, in which the impressioner Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now rented on the Airbnb site.
The next free night in the house is about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and curly, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The painter's world-famous lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
There are three bedrooms in the house, two rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first given a breath to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone is planning to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Compared to Airbnb's page, it is next resolved after a week, on Sunday of the Shellman saint, and therefore could be suitable for some traders on holiday to move on to book the house of the painter.
The two nights over the shopping weekend cost no more than 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130,000 Icelandic crowns as the Newsletter arrives.
A lot of people in the pathology and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the chronoid virus.
Five have been diagnosed with the Crohn's disease virus within the last three days and most of the other infected have not been infected.
Many of them have gone to the hospital because of this, and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the Cronus virus within the country yesterday and two were detected during a national screening.
A specialist in the National Medical Service says that growing numbers of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into the community.
"There has been a record of the previous inland contamination and it is a virus that has not been seen here before so that we have no particular reason to believe that she has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now, "said Kamilla Sigríður Josefsdotti, a specialist in the field of antiquities of the National Medical Service.
Most of them infected have been associated with individuals from abroad.
More samples than some who were in association with the infected have begun to show the signs of the chorovirus.
"Now there is no influence going on and less of other respiratory infections so we can be somewhat free by doing these tests on individuals who at the time of the infusion had found a reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
Ejaculation is mostly complete but it is not excluded that more people need to go to a hospital.
Two of the infected people were diagnosed after seeking a sport event.
It has raised questions as to whether it is justifiable to hold such an event.
The public communications manager says this as long as people comply with criteria and rules.
Kamilla almost ruled out that the other infected people were infected with the athletics.
"If there are no more people in isolation from these people after having been around them at these sports events, then we can keep it until our anti-personnel measures have been effective.
But it hasn't come to light, "said Kamilla.
The effectiveness of public protection is constantly reviewed.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or limitations if it seems to be for the occasion," said Kamilla.
After a week of bed, multiple data measurements will be taken up to a thousand people.
This new location could affect the situation.
"Decided mind to cook" - See Elisa Vidar's menu
Elisha Vidsdottir is an ex-wife in a nightclub and plays with Val.
She's also a master of nutrition, a mother, and she works as a mathematician.
She needs a lot of energy for the summer of the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day begins to come up to work out of eight, "says Elisha.

Elisa feels very nourishing to pick up his daughter early at the school.

Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting her final hand on a master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows very well what is appropriate for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and practice.
"What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I feel it is important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to group food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's probably okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always. "
Elisa is very interested in firepower.

I have to say that the confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I am a good cook. "

Million: Get me something carbonated for rehearsals, bread with diet, breakfast or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflicts between police and opponents in Seattle
The Seattle City Council in Washington has described the state of rebellion following a mass protest in the city centre.
A law enforcement officer took hold yesterday to blow up and a gun to tempt him to roam a large area under his command by the opponents, and plucked over many meadows in the vicinity of the city's courthouse.
The police reported on Twitter at least 11 opponents had been arrested and that a study was conducted on the damage done to the city police station yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The Civil Service and Police Department say that the opponents have stoned the police with rocks, bottles, vapors and other loose bodies and were one officer transferred to the hospital where his injuries occurred.
However, the Seattle protests were peaceful for a long time in front of them.
There was a blow to show opponents in Portland, Oregon, but in the city there has been a tough attack between the opponents and the heavily armed forces of the FBI.
There, as in several cities of the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalling Georges Floyd, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis on 25 May, against systemic racism in the American community and demanding a penalty.
Not returned until after resolution
It is not yet possible to withdraw their flights from Iceland air, which should take effect in the next month.
A positive vote on the nuclear agreement of the airline airline Iceland by airline at Islandair will be concluded on Tuesday tomorrow.
The Godlög Líney Johannsdóttir chairman of the Society says it is absolutely certain that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissal until the result of the vote is reached.
"This is clearly linked," says Gudsløg Líney.
"There have been no revocations, this must be done in such a way that it is possible to man the machines.
So, of course, people are impatient to know if they have a job after the month. "
The price is for a contract signed before the week of July 19.
It is expected that it will be valid until September 2025 and will be based on a contract previously concluded by air carriers with a view to voting.
On the 17th July, the board of directors and the council of directors of the airline company Ísland agreed to invite an all-military stop to Iselandair, the members of the board of directors agreed to it in a vote.
She never showed up, but this was decided following the decision by Iceland Air to stop discussions with the Flying Flying Company, to terminate all of its flight crew and to search for contracts with another airline.
Then the pilots of the company were to take up their duties on board temporarily.
Ask her how she thinks the vote will go, "God-lög Líney says it's hard to tell."
"People are in pain after this post-Icelandic air, when all the airline pilots were dismissed and reported that the agreement would be made with another airline.
Now it will come to light whether it affects you, "she says.
At the end of April, 940 pilots were operating at Icelandair, and then 900 of them, approximately 95%, were dismissed.
Their term of notice is long: he shall be three months with the chief of the labourers, and shall end in the month of the month of July.
In this group, approximately 90% of the Icelandair aircraft are in the region.
What's the deal not approved?
"Then we wish for continued discussions with our adversaries.
With this contract, we are meeting the requirements of Iceland Air.
It is clear to him that the pilots have gone too far. "
A resolution on nuclear agreements is concluded and Iceland Air will present a second annual report tomorrow.
The vote on the motion for a resolution on the new nuclear agreement will be closed at noon tomorrow.
The indication of Iceland air for another year will also be made tomorrow, but the results of the rapid release indicate that the company's consumption has decreased by 85% from the same period of the previous year.
A political resolution on the nuclear agreement between the airline company Iceland and the Confederation of Working Life for Iceland started on Wednesday 22 July and will end tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote for the contract are the employees of Iceland Air, who will pay a social security fee to the FLEGT.
Iceland Air and FFI signed a new nuclear contract on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday, Iceland Air had had had discussions with the company after the flight crew collided the previous contract in a vote settlement at the beginning of July.
At that time, Iselandair had fired all the pilots and flight crew of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the new nuclear contract was signed.
According to a new nuclear contract, aircraft must fly five hours more per month before the same basic wage.
The core contract is valid until 2025, where the decisions of the flight crew and the flight crew have been agreed on how long to fly on one shift.
The contract was presented to FFI's partners at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel on the last Monday and described a number of flight attendants who talked to them about the dissatisfaction of the contract.
However, most seemed to agree that the contract had to be approved to keep FFI alive.
According to the results of the emergency release of approximately 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic crowns, the data for Iceland for ISELANAIR will be presented tomorrow.
Iceland Air sent the auction hall an emergency calculation last Wednesday, which said that the company had received about $60 million in the fourth quarter or about 8.3 billion in the fourth quarter.
The amount of money recovered and its equivalent was approximately 154 million US dollars at the end of the fourth quarter, at about 21 billion kroner.
Icelandair also aims to offer a share of the company in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude a contract with fifteen loan queens, government and the Boeing Air Operator by the end of the month before being invited to participate.
New variant rather than new virus type
"New virus only means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been going on inside the country, "says Mår Kristjánsson, Senior Medical Officer at the Infection Department of the Landhospital, reporting that the" new type of virus "has been detected here on the country.
Three inland pollution was detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had been involved in the social service at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection was undetected and infected.
The infection was also detected in an individual who came to the country on July 15 and two who were in association with him began to show signs of COVID - 19.
Yesterday, contamination related to the infection reported the previous day and following a cross-section analysis in the Icelandic genome analysis was detected as "a new type of virus that has not been identified here before."
Disinfecting has been completed in connection with that infection.
Years have shown that it is not a new virus but the same virus that has spread throughout the world, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 covirus.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and whether it could say anything about the start of another storm of danger, Mår says that as it is, there is a single case to be discussed and it could go so that nothing more can be done about it.
"However, if it comes up with cases that are not related to foreign countries and have the same genotype and this particular variation could be deduced from [about the second wave], but it is untimely to so supported," explains Mår.
Oh, my God, the hot pot.
Is the secret to the happiness of the Islanders hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC's daily analysts lead to the likeness of an enjoyable video that sheds light on the country's swimming pool and hot spots.
The Icelandic bathers are special in the world, and it is clear that no one in the world is as many bathers in each population.
The natural earth is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of this kingdom.
The children's pregnancy was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less useful to use the hot water for their own health.
Divorces are described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of their position.
Dissolve the mobile phone, people talk about personal nights at home and space, or the use of the attractive power of water: thoughts and charms of souls and bodies.
To pick up a hundred days of elections
A hundred days are until the Americans go to the election and elect their president to four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a rerun, but he has to pick up soon.
Joe Biden, the expected supporter of the Democratic Party, has a big head start on Trump in the country, taken by the viewing parties.
According to the recent investigation of the AP news agency, the number of people in the United States of America considered the population to be wrong.
The reactions of Trump due to the world-wide presence of the new Cronus virus are also very hostile and therefore count for more Americans than before that the President has held bad financial interests.
Some people say only two out of ten Americans that America is on the right track.
32% say support for Trump's reaction due to the accident and 48% say he has kept his financial interests well.
In March it was 56% and in January it was 67%.
According to the mean of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is followed by 49.9% on a national basis, but Trump is followed by 41.9%.
Trump himself has tried to move attention from his performance to the age of Biden, pushing under so-called cultural divisions, and proclaiming policies to turn to law and order.
Biden's offer, however, is a major challenge to keep track of Trump and consider a strong chance of winning if the election really turns on how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Unpopular Trump also appears to be coming down to the Congregation of the Republik and fear that the Democrats could even reach the majority in the United States, which has so far been very successful.
Politico told us on the days that he kept the follow of the class and the proponent comparable, and that's now the Republik class would have its greatest loss for decades.
The region has been particularly poor in the 2016 elections, and it now appears that this trend will continue.
Trump has in the last few days tried to scare the inhabitants of the outskirts to follow him, including by saying that he will be the President of Biden, he will destroy the outskirts of the United States and push under race.
Among other things, Trump has dropped down regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House which was meant to increase the number of peripheral changes.
Then he encouraged the "housewife" to destroy the United States of America to read the article after the former assistant governor of New York, where she assumed that Biden would destroy the outskirts of the United States and took Trump under it.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhood and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it better! "said the President.
The population of the United States of America is an ever-expanding group of citizens.
According to the NPR, they're about half of all U.S. wives.
From the time George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become President.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney got most votes from this group and lost to Barack Obama.
Inspections have shown that although Trump secured a very large proportion of the 2016 exodus, it has been accompanied by a substantial reduction in the number of exodus.
Although there are differences between the scans, Biden has recommended about 15 percent advance on Trump in the transformations in the past.

Is the Olympian fire going to light at the end of the corridor?
After the final decision had been made to delay the Olympic Games, an event that only the World War nations have stalled up to this, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be known as "the light at the ends of the aisles," and so it was expected that the world-wide chrono virus that the world-based population is now moving through together.
People have additional years to prepare themselves and the authorities in Japan are adding to the cost of the delay.
Everyone keeps their heads up a lot, though.
When it was reported that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympic Games this year, the gospel of the Japanese representatives was unfailing.
They wept and laughed for a change, yet Tokyo had applied to keep the games in 2016, but they paid it lower for Rio in Brazil.
At this time, Tokyo City and Japan would take a bath in the world's attention.
The players were scheduled for July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for years, starting from July 23rd 2021 and ending on August 8th.
If the games cannot be kept, if the Cronus virus continues to be too much of a threat, the games will be stopped.
But no one wants to think of that end.
The Olympics are no ordinary sports match.
There is nothing to save, the display should always be magnificent and look for the top of the last game.
The choice of the city of Olympiality is based on the evaluation of the city's presentations.
The bigger the presentation is - the more likely it is to have the nose.
Tokyo lasted $150 million trying to keep the Olympics in 2016, or that's worth $20 million.
In the second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, 75 million dollars, about 10 billion kroner, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had thus the responsibility of 30 million people for the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean, depending on how much it costs to build Olympian village, playful and generally to strengthen the country's insides to deal with such a thing, prepare it and keep the games on your own.
The Japanese planners have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year because of the chronological virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, in a report from a national accountant in Japan published at the end of the last year, the cost was almost double that figure.
It is unlikely that you will be able to fully estimate the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it will cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese tax payers could therefore run from $15 to $30 million.
There are such high numbers that all the treasures of the Icelandic Empire were able to perform only about half of the Olympics, according to the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are represented by the degree of importance that they are likely to become the domain of economists, who try to understand the numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
As a matter of principle, many people have found that the impact of the Olympic Games is less positive than that of the economy of those who hold them.
A short-term effect is likely to occur, for example, a large number of jobs in a short period of time, but a longer period of time, cities tend to sit up with a debt-to-debt and a higher cost of low use of human resources.
Ríó i Brasilia sits up with serious debts due to the 2016 Games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major athletes built for the Games.
Figures have been reported after the games in London in 2012, but it has been found that only 10% of those who received jobs related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
It means that there was no new job except for a small amount of work.
In general, cities have not come out very well from the financial ability to maintain Olympibility because of the corresponding cost to the actors that are built for the actors.
However, the benefits are likely to lie in the increased circulation of travellers who want to visit the Olympian cities after the Games, which are, however, highly uncertain about the Games in 2021.
It is also unclear whether all the number of viewers who usually pick up the games can be taken into account.
The chief thing, though, is the honor which the cities may have been chosen, but it is hard for them to judge.
Therefore, despite the high cost, the joy of the players is not such as to make it possible to set a price.
But even if the show is important and there is no saving, it's not just about money, of course.
It's the athletes who're in the foreground.
For some people, it's just a surprise to delay the games.
The Australian feminist and the gold prize holder in her article at the late Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, casolet and would have been far away a good fun in summer but is hoping to be in competition for the games in 2021.
She is therefore among those athletes who are only rather happy with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to quit after the games this year, they had been held at the right time, the temptation of the games means in some cases that they quit the race before the games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through a year as well as exercise.
A few athletes came to see the Olympic Games in 2016 and Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending a number of interviews in the USA's home country lately to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's going to the games in 2021, but she's not quite sure she'll still be at the top of the games next year, so she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be a tall age, it is in a higher order for a feminist in the first order.
"This is a sensitive subject," says Biles but smiles out in another interview that was held on the Instagram page of the Olympian Committee asked whether she is going to get as far at the games in 2021 as she did in Rio 2016.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be on top after a full year of practice," says Biles.
She has previously talked about her body not being able to tolerate the pressure that goes with the social training much longer.
Anyway, she's rehearsing for the Olympic Games in 2021.
Biles acknowledges that it was uncomfortable to have to stop practicing suddenly when the world was at its peak and the hall was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles more than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympiugull could not buy any access above the others; she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
Definitely form a better file than most people.
"We have a stiff plan now.
It was hard to start rehearsing again first after the hall opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'm going to increase the practice as well as the year goes by.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games are going to be played or whether they're going to be held, but we're still practicing because they're going to be, that's all.
I've put too much on me to leave the sport now, "says Biles.
With it like more close eyes, or perhaps more awareness that this place can come up to the players not being held at all in 2021 but also.
However, to think of it, it is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation at the age of the Cronus virus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games as long as they are held in the year.
Maybe the Olympian fire will light up at the end of the Covid corridor.
Postponed wedding due to a passenger
The modern family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to delay her wedding because of the chronological virus.
She was supposed to marry the ex-Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think of now," said the actress in conversation with the People.
"We really want to get married sometime and have them the dream wedding and have all the parties that are dear to us.
But we decided to push it forward and focus on what is important now and that's helping to share information about the importance of being with a mask and staying at home.
I look more to the world than the wedding girls these days.
There's a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what's happening in the world. "
