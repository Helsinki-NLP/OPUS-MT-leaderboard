They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you care?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.

The other kids call her Piglet.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever arrived or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you gonna be in bed all day, or what?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She cried.
Can I see Tom today?
Nobody wants that.

Try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I walk like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're taller than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like going to new places and seeing new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bore me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better idea.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate has a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What exactly was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt as to who will be elected.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the story of the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She advocated gender equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings, dear brother.
Where is the Portuguese embassy?
My friends didn't let me down during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Get dressed fast.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The queue of the test cabins encircled through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the curve.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man across the road.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom set me up.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the parish.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up, turn in your essays.
My father is well.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll have to do without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even my mom knows about it.
He would have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom for a second between the eyes.
He will fall for the temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated fast.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have different opinions from you.
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I give in secret for my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't go downtown.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked with the headlights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
No one here is called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
That must do it.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before 2: 00.
I am.
That was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I had never seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom's fast.
Approximately 4.9 per cent of Finns are Finnish Swedes, that is, Swedish speakers.
Unfortunately, Tom got away.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everybody dreams.
Flour is made on wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd feel better.
When I got home, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.

Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I have great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You're gonna die soon.
This is not good.
I think you're right.
Monday starts on Sunday.
It's certainly not worth the effort.

When does Tom need it?
I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.
Tom knows you're here.
Tom frowned.
I think I'm staying.
I saved your life.
And what do we do now?
I didn't cut Tom's hair.
I don't deserve to live.
