The Prague Stock Exchange ended with less points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of ČEZ's shares reached about half of their value on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, immediately reacted to the fall of Monday when it fell to about 6%.
This time's downfall is due to the fall in stock on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the financial sector secretary, is also expressed here.
Fall from actions in Asia
The actions of the Asian Bags experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally attenuated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index during its financial day marked almost four percent, although it later attenuated its losses by reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows the movements of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares of the Sidney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Secretary of the Index, fell to 3.6 per cent.
"The planned rescue actions in the US are insecure and this influences the financial market around the world," said the head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Blood bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system support plan to which $700 billion (almost 12 billion kroner) should be spent.
The legislators, in that way, ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions lived in a bloody bath and mainly the index of actions picked up the largest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones's index fell to almost seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell already before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion in Banking · Global Voices
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial assistance to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
American legislators caused a gap in the talks about the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion kroner).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted on.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
He said on Sunday to the Reuters agency, Barney Frank, president of the Committee for Financial Services and the Assembly Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolved our dissenting views on the way the market stabilization package should take, "Democratic Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with finance minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already working on it, "said Paulson.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis has an explicit impact on the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing their best to get Congress to finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' business in front of the Asian finance market, as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday's trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even if they will not stand at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion have to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, which would be another 100 billion dollars and later the last 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the President can veto this decision, but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armored contract
The president of the Senate's banking committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility for the money from the program for the protection of taxpayers' taxes from their losses, an easing closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the programme, and set up a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards the agreement that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help house owners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly payments of the debtors' time-bound payments and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the economic head of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea to be realized but rather difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, "Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz. server.
That the plan is now approved or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"Much more important is that, already this week, the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that such approval is to be reached is, at the moment, the most important thing, "Marek said.
Armed hand fight: MP3 Player against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile reproduces MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends almost on the way it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for me to get the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP disks no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If the vinyl disks with art rock, jazz, or blues are put on their shelves, you are probably dreaming of at least this type of record player.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the MP3 music.
And here are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the market helmets from twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
Also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobile.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse photo device and can even manage to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDA, they're going to have a small computer in their pocket as well.
This is a small miracle as no refrigerator can make a barbecue and no TV can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile before the display indicator will be lit by asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy slots.
Few are the mobile phones that manage to play music more than ten or twelve hours, most of which are much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of it, they are constantly called still, for more safety, a charger for the work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, as even the worst can hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices have the universal USB connector and not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reading units can the small memory cards that are used on the mobile be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is necessary.
Just fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile and players create their order in the music library alone according to the name of the performer, title of the album, gender or also according to user assessment.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Seeker and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day just for a while, as in the tram, then it is enough for you to have any mobile that you play.
Which almost really gets any cell phone.
It should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player reproduces the music.
The MP3 reproduces it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy on-line music.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and to buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be an argument of weight to acquire a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most are limited only to the issues of fleeting success of the radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) will in future dominate the music industry.
Most people always have a cell phone on them.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends if you always have headphones with you or at least the handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has practically every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobile phones with music will be their price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand kroner can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a classic headset entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input for classic headphones, cost up to 15,000.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record players is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, it counts for a reduction of data.
Which device to decide on
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example, the Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card it will reach two thousand kroner.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and want to still buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
The capacity (maximum 2 GB) does not require more than 1,100 kroner to be spent.
If you consider one of the most demanding music lovers to take hand of the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 keys which make a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile of the walkman line has almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category, about four thousand kroner, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned more arrival brings you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already going to reach the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is well developed and our operators offer almost all services like their Western European partners.
However, here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna take long to get here.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU) which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is among the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they are sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high as compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTU), Pavel Dvořák, also said that there is no place for any other operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices to which the classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was demonstrated that there is a place for such operators and that they can be successful.
In addition, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking there is the Penta group, which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U: fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order to be able to function effectively, it is enough for many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, often counter the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers at least half of the cheap in relation to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to a trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically directed at man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as that of Poland could be hooked up in our country.
Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepický, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services it is relatively saturated. "
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there are any virtual operators in the Czech Republic, that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region, "said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, he said that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, they try to do their best to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest on the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile services.
And the sooner the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings, "said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they show better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"We now believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
To date, no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field, "said Vhímil Sršeț, spokesman for Telefónica O2, for mobil.cz.
Other operators are concerned about the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with O2's opinion, adds: "We have not yet registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
He adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table some specific contract that would be possible to study on such a short horizon. "
Vodafone focuses rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We regard this as the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile. "
Responsible offices - with the operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition, leading to a fall in prices and thus to a fall in profits.
Then why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of that is the grip when U: fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on the ČTU was at the time of the entry of U: fon by the T-Mobile society.
It is attested by public information available on the ČTU websites.
But precisely now U: fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile phone market has not long been open to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would be for him and, above all, for his services great requirements. "
This is why this access to mobile operators is extremely disheartening because of the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licensing (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical position on this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator is concluded.
To date no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential stakeholders rather was not interesting enough for the classic operators, "he added to our question Kristián Chalupa, from the UOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than just a consideration, apart from that, they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile phone services"
Of course, pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and price reductions do not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
The dramatic shock in this whole case really lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of petrol at the gas stations, for it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding rise in liability in their market actions.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, lack, as well as telecommunications regulators, "he added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is of course an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTU according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise in a similar way.
The current complaints from the parties concerned (the GTS Novera company is inluded) show that in all negotiations with the operators they are confronted with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility in the ČTU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the UOHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We've met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of the competence of ČTU in the field of commercial tenders was recently submitted and did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be well known to the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks.
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator that already exists in Czech mobile networks is unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile services, but only a part are public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the same by ordering a lot of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions on all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If such cases were to be discovered as the ones he cites, it could be said of an infringement in the terms of the contract that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," he replied to the question about this problem, Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three companies mentioned above, this can be the case of thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make a profit that is not negligible and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so you cannot dispose absolutely of it as a normal customer of the operators. "
This is precisely what the ČTU should find to be minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile phone operators are entangled in this type of procedure, why block the virtual operator's entry?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not going to want to be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that its commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we'll stop being the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant fall in service prices.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this eruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
In the more advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to get the first virtual operator to emerge, and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority is passing this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of powers in these cases will convince them.
But let's not despair.
If this backstage information is correct and the virtual operator really gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If any of the operators let any virtual mobile phone operator in, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we will perhaps stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new hymn was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with male voice and one with female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for the song.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can hear all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the Choir, to look at the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consistent," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates next year its 175 anniversary.
The song Where, my Home first sounded in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it his own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company.
This can now be acquired by almost 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the infocentres and posts of the transport company at the Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Homešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka stations.
The bonds can be purchased on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than 400 people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitely begin to forget about ticket outlets at metro stations, where they had to line up regularly so far to take out a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased on the Internet, and the Opencard card is recharged to you in one of the 13 subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window available to passengers with prepared staff that helps those interested with the purchase on the Internet and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said the project spokesman, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard on the automatic vending machines that are found in some of the vestibules of the subway.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket-chopping machine and the travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the stations of the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway.
"Now there are five in the city, but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be loaded only on it.
The electronic bonds since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, on the bypass trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 used mainly by the inhabitants of the central Bohemia localities.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drapual of the organization Ropid that sets the times of the collective transport of Prague.
The bypass buses have their reading cards mounted at the driver's locker.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," he added.
Passengers who do not travel on the bypass buses and do not remember when they are finished with the validity of the bonus can go to vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the screen of the machine, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The South-East wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
In 1945, the German Sudetes called for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is taken from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some groups of Germans from the Sudetes were presumably addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular file and that are now stored in the collection of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask the American President in a letter not to allow the return of the "Šumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that the American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their heart."
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the South-East Germans presumably represents, according to these, the Czech national character, a hope only in brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American President to take on Šumava for today and forever under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people we are given to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals by the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the šumavos Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on the šumavas lands on whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of the post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists, rightly paints the expectations of the Germans of the south-east of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had to have minimal sense that it was going to be about their expulsion from the Republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed that they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is even confirmed by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German of Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was arrested by the British and placed in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would do them good," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister's office, Aleš Đebíček promises that it will deter drivers from driving dangerous behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures.
I'd have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that the belts are tied before starting.
It wants to reach the awareness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, ultimately, also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embody emotions.
And for this we are attested to by "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written with big letters on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pay."
This must symbolize that man at a time of desiste can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "scare" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers the sugar and whip system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, you pass a red light and it saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
The drivers must be reminded of the risks, "says the transport psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital, Martin Kořán.
And that is why there is a need for an information campaign in the press and mainly for negative advertising, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in return for peace
Israel's interim government president, Ehud Olmert, spoke about the return of almost all the land occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that he appeared on Monday in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all (occupied) lands if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll have some percent of these lands, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a percent similar (from the land of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which there were several deaths and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the old city.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he insisted later.
Withdrawal of the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke of Israel & apos; s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also mean concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to set off to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hizbulah (Shia movement), they will have to disengage themselves from the ongoing support caused by the terrorism of Hamas (Shia movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, "the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewardess on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova we are asked whether the stewarders and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the law of road traffic," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having two other places reserved.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment when the stewardess distributes the coffee or the newspapers.
Here what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no standing sites, which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was taken away and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on the move if they have a seat, "he told us about their position.
The stewardess doesn't know the law.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term "Vehicle Reviser," whose rights and obligations are not defined, "says Hanzelka.
The director of the road traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks, on the contrary, that this problem is adequately addressed by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot sites.
That's it, "he says.
The buses are divided between the urban ones, where there are places to stand and of maximum limited speed, interurban with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with a safety belt.
Like on the plane, says the expert.
BESIP's transport safety expert, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems with the stewardess movement on the bus.
"During the course of the journey there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
Even here we are not sure that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess can be hit on the head. "
"However, if the bus suddenly stops, it is clear that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on an urban bus or on the tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier, "he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law this problem is not solved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier to offer the stewardess service.
He employs two hundred in it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess post is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, on their way in.
It would save even expenses, "he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks stewardess in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We have no stewardess, we are against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident, "he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened.
In the accident of the line that unites Naples, a young stewardess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane by blocking the way to the car, without using the intermittent.
His driver tried a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he hit the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the stewardess's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but is waiting for the financial expenses also for the part of the culprit.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring more precision to the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year thirty experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not reached any specific conclusion.
They do not devote too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum highway speed and mobile use during the march, "says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarders something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," ending the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of the safety of the buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope rests on Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB bank board of directors for its collaborators, there are no big words missing.
The merger of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank of DEKA can form 'a central market of capital of the financial group of Sparkassen', as the letter, published on Monday, says.
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competition block' with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for further mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how you understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Institute for the Monitoring of Financial Services, which recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time to find a solution.
For some time now, also from the Frankfurt part, there has been a lot of talk about the union of such a type between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse's customers know for their investment funds, and the West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August let it know that he sees no sense in the bank's merger, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or West LB.
But the DEKA Board of Directors, which now consists of the regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to start negotiations with West LB on common commercial activities.
This could involve a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area, the name of the DEKA bank appears, with its 3000 collaborators, among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and the Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against the Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of the DEKA bank's merger with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the board of directors of the Helaba, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that, it seems to be more clear that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are going to pass, the BayernLB's union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will be missing from the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it was much better off from the financial crisis than the real estate of Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB is left.
But such geo-strategic reflections are just a part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, that the deutsche Sparkassen - und Gir- Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
So, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank, it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As one can match the coexistence between unique parts of the bank and the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the Italian weekend"
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-litre Kaiser beer barrel is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a little palmadita, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23: 45 there are three buses, 'direction Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6: 30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly intended for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
On one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a lining of artificial skin and glasses with silver-colored sticks, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, considering that there are only three excursions this year.
At night on the way over there, during the day on the meadow, at 22: 30.
Spending the night there means only the unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of the Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Soon the tranquility reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian license plate take another break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 in the morning in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest," next in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the Internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second: "When the doors of the campaign store open, that means march!" he shouts Marco in the early morning.
"Marching!" Marching and occupying the back places in the campaign store.
"Do not take the places ahead, for we will block, and all with yellow caps do not sit on the same bench, spread over all space!"
One liter of beer, Marco ruge, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he'll be busy! "
Third: "This evening at exactly 10: 30 you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone's going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on a sign of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
It is desired to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend"
There are no exact data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and tormentously enter the tents, 10% of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with over 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and the Austrians are the first.
The preferred Italian campaign shop is thus called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleeping nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, said only last week Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück.
The fact that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that's happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the Munich property financier, who is listed in the DAX index, receives a loan of one billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist the turbulence in the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters that credit aid amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to be of interest.
Money comes as from private banks as well as from public-law banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the Deffa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was lent for long-term projects financed them only for a short time - which is now no longer possible because of market mistrust.
In the first half of the year the capital reserve of the cash bank has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital has delayed a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, the continued income from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, the revenue from the imputation for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions from credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many revenue from the repayments of the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Deffa group as well as the interest repayments under the federal tax code and the business organized for the consortium companies, the negative balance could cause a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financial company was initially lost in speculations with industrial credits for the real estate, which served as a reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be made from the financing of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very imprecisely.
It's a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial financial in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the customer deposits, he, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost EUR 50 billion to finance a part of the Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for group funding for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially not fit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the president of the board of directors of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) are based on the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the shareholders and the bank's creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that funding in its full volume should not be required.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
There was a voice that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost in insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot at least reassure people concerned.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The borrowing courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, borrowing courses according to the position in the property register clearly tend to fall.
Most affected are the borrowings of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with the reason for the borrowings whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the significant growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the emitting banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start from the amortization of pensions in the near future.
Or something's going to happen, which you don't risk imagining anyone - the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That's going to be a reason, because the creditors will spend the nights without sleeping, breaking their heads on the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Even short-term investors can put the end point and use the new-account transport of losses for future profit-compensation tax payments on change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls started laughing: the German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
I was afraid before I went to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train for 40 minutes to the Highschool Tachibana.
I just had to find the way, luckily I didn't miss out.
It seems that the beginning of the classes is not set as strictly as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
From 8: 00 in the morning the students come, at 9: 20 a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room' begins.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially in the face of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, that's how I put myself on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything right: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
I was very happy at the moment because I had already started to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the Japanese girls' survival vocabulary and means "cute, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong rang, I really felt mugged.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then at the recess they all took out their Bentos.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools the bentos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hope of getting to know him better during a recess.
That's what I read about in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?," my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
Finally, for years I'd rather read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I began to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
They have great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here although Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life. "
Rats have feelings, too.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger runs away, why has it also been afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, acting in the way similar to us, feel the same?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about the feeling and in general about the consciousness, we enter the unknown sphere because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as the other animals: it does the dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that lead conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
One other particularity is found in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is linked to the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if the consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animals, created as a whole, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the experience, but at the same time there is also one other aspect of the consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
The processes of animal consciousness could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the studies of short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing happens rather to the neutral coraccounts of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Curiously this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for that is activated, as is the case with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
In view of this point of view, the sensations are very set aside from the cerebral cortex, which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature they follow the classifications of the fine feelings because we can differentiate and classify the states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others together with ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the bodily feelings and the brain trunk, as does Jaak Pankseep, but it is more concentrated in the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it is possible to refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behave in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing danger a cockroach runs away, why are you afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior still does not prove the similarity of experience.
This is true that neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, the cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is it the brain trunk that's responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and to the tongue).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, while the same is measured for rats and men.
As I do not investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You can say I don't see beyond my nose, but I'd rather move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical thrill.
The President of UEFA Platini: Deadline for grace for Poland and the Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the alternate Prime Minister, said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as the proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organize the European championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start, and in both countries there is much to do. "
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do very fast work, "said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA is not going to take our eyes off."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured the president of UEFA Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
In the last season alone, many clubs in the first division were convicted because of downsizing to the lower category, and finally the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, she spoke in an interview about private life - and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counter-attacks.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-couple: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage failure is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "unheard of by Meg how often he tells the history of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man said to "New York Daily News."
Among other things it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan, after a divorce, lives alone, Quaid is again married and recently is a twin dad.
And so he ends up with his statements by highlighting: "Whatever my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine. "
The prices of air tickets and hotels are falling.
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year's.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
The air tickets and hotel nights became again cheap - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a major change in the second half.
After prices on the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices already dropped to 3.6 percent compared last year.
The trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of American tourists in travel decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also seen much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, air ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Because of the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of the plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and the Firstclass were small.
In Germany, price change was more significant than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second semester they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even reduced by half.
The cause of the change in prices is one part the increase in the weak economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market the demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights of non-profit distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1: 0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still doesn't go out to do the goal first.
Kristoffer Klein presented very well the forced landing of the national team player Marko Martin.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
Everything I meant to say exactly by reacting to what happened, I could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the Hamburg stadium cabin entrance.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the people present were back in their places.
Rieger was almost for three decades a physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a very great reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That's why your request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers as a sign of consent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the main coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: "Wow, the second goal!"
But that wasn't done.
"Today was not all nice to see," Marcell Jansen added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have it "more relaxed."
The result 1: 0 (1: 0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
"That was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of board on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to play it," said Marcell Jansen.
It provides that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The late-bound team with its players such as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric scorer as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can't shine with its successes.
"We need more of the feeling and the dribbling," Jol demands.
After the vote defeat
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the banks' salvation package dropped a certain period of the Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in his history.
Then Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20: 30, one of the most important barometers in the world listed a 5 per cent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained at 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser at the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
The shares of the Goldmann Sachs bank lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The salvation plan provides for resources to be made available to purchase so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the sum is to be paid at once but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the equity option receipts for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state box.
Action courses in Europe and in the US continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is low and the Dax is negatively influenced.
Despite the state-projected salvation of the financial market, the US index Dow Jones continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the actions of salvation on the part of the federal government and private banks, the action of the Munich property financier a period of time lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6000 points and listed a deficit of 3.7 per cent in 5,839 units.
Financial markets all over the world have fallen.
The opening of the Wall Street day in New York began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion saving package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the project of salvation, the vote in senate may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 per cent, CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia the Japanese main index Nikkei after profits fell to 1.26 percent in 11,743.61 units.

In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the path of space probes
For many years a mystery phenomenon has caused the researchers to be confused: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to maneuver, has led to disconcertation among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the path of the space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what I surprise researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave 100% as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
They are more of a frequency of speed irregularities.
The probes have a speed of more or less.
Physics could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, believes solemnly now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what the astronomers were left in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The researchers of the universe know the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
She is supposed to have the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are abducted in southern Egypt.
The negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back to the point of attention of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper reports on the most important cases.
Apparently the European tourists abducted in the Sahara are released.
The same information is provided by the State Egyptian television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian radio station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
'Now we control his state of health, 'Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in security, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo.
What is incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue, "said the guard.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when all of a sudden "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them arrested in the Sudan, Chad and Egypt border area.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom of six million euros; the money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom," referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Stepfather abuse "led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiry study, knew that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
In the season that the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court was aware that Ms. Randle, who used much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after she had been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "given up life."
In April 2007 his real father, Terrace Randle, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her up and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetish, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she had not done so, the issue would probably not have ended in the courts. "
And he added, "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother, the abuse was over his daughter over the years.
Clearly she would have had a promising, successful and happy future. "
An officer charged for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not provide any indication of the intention to commit an offence.
BBC correspondent for the Frank Gardner Defense said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause on the protection of information.
The Royal Legal Service stated that the staff member must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B & B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over £80 thousand after the rescue / rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The Government, in fact, provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers that companies and their members have to pay "humiliating"
Eventually, the 14 billion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest on the interim is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with caution are called to pay the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent today.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be £450 000 in 2009.
This means that societies will have to recover £81 thousand to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general director of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with caution in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of some society since 1945.
"We will need to examine all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect building societies and their members against what might be a relevant price," added Mr Cole.
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest due, which can be almost twice as much.
Since mutual construction companies are organisations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest in their savings.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter since next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after an increase of two pence in February and followed by the investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
The former Prime Minister of Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail on charges of extortion of Tka 50 million ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption in his charge.
His long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, militarily supported, first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is now unclear what the terms of his release are or whether she will be able to remain free when he will return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that she could not obtain bail because she was already being treated abroad on parole," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to appeal the Supreme Court's order."
His defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to what a leader of the Awami League said last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Themes for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the UN - have been unable to take advantage of a recent anti-polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Committee after the decision forcing the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting TV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its participation in ITV by 17.9 per cent below 7.5 per cent.
Precisely, the Commission said that the interests of BSkyB hinder competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of participation in ITV raised questions about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All of them, including Virgin's head, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB, commented that the force to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and was a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, would have delivered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of the administration officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and former Produrator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But it was later found that the lawyers had not been assessed worse than other their colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the redundancies would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The former head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The report of the Attorney-General is very critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and stresses how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "remarkably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush collaborator, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honor
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the London ceremony, said that getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are running the nominations for this year's awards and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that go beyond time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell from Meat Loaf remained about nine years in the rankings and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including a surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Then it came up that he had a cyst on his vocal rope.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps early for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the north of the Primiera Calle - before I found the Second Street - between the Bowery and the Second Avenue.
This little street, more or less 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than an active track.
No sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primiera Calle
that wants to repavement Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans include the old-date neighbors who commented to be enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the block's past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee of Neighbourhood for Land Use that took place this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community District Manager, said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, while waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month's meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark in history.
Some believe that he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great property was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the picture of the establishment on the cover of Ramones's album "Rocket to Russia."
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the boredom of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a strip of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and no-end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty and anti-window iron storage doors, with old newspapers of weeks blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood close to the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty bottle of beer about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that you could get a clean.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimated the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old partner in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "transition bilingual education" for English-students.
However, the question open to Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which in the classroom prefers instruction in languages other than English, is effective in cancelling the distance in the final results.
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
More than a third of the students, many of whom are newly arrived, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of students in the fourth year have been positively evaluated in the 2008 math test.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent has mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than that favoured by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the constant evaluation of the skills and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main one on Sixth Street, the school's approach to teaching English to students is in the "total immersion."
Inmersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has arrived from Mexico and, if you enter the classroom 12 months later, you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of your party's politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their same constant support for dark bilingual education the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While it is said that immigrants must learn English, Mr Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "you must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American financial market rescue plan may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The shares of crude oil decreased from 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning negotiation at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped of over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before going back, once again, because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety took over from investors, once again, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the bank operations of the Wachow Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that, at the frenzy weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "seem not to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation is deteriorating, it is expected that demand for commodities, including oil, will fall.
"The prospects for global equity, the interest rate and exchange rate are going to be increasingly uncertain," wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is to assess whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After having spent, for the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought I'd seen everything.
Then he saw things develop in the second room this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without a notation into a disinflow game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second room began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the bleak clouds.
At this time it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship among the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when one cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He is a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think. "
While Favre and Coles were in the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith punched another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail Warner.
In the last turn, the misdemeanors forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets ever made in a room.
To the team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second room or the third room?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second room much more than the third quarter.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time. "
Gebrselassie rested head of the world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown because many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the well-to-do flat race in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie has for 27 seconds destroyed his previous 2: 04: 26 record, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set world record number 26 in a race of an impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would aggravate its problems with asthma.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2: 06: 05 in 1998.
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told the journalists that he had suffered cramps in the calf two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told the journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end it all went well. "
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the Afro-eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating too much of his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1: 02: 04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his pacemaker fell.
But just before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie took a last drive to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2: 05: 36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2: 07: 48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2: 19: 19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain has the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2: 24: 14.
She didn't take part in the Beijing Games either, so she was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head and then recover them after 18 ½ miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2: 21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2: 25: 01.
In a separate city, pride and proof of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guabas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in Florida's travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the depression season - remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and who does not know what is being lost."
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about the way our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a life-long resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of Black people and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes scorn, sometimes praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten inside the history of black people and human drama.
With a concrete face both in life and in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Outside the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern public school maron with its white finishes, well maintained gardeners and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitory rooms."
In just a few hundred words, therefore, Ms. Hurston links Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a living eccentric who returned often after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, is remembered that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without prior notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today is proud to dress with dignity.
"Most of the residents were fascinated," Mr. Franklin said, while many were sarcastic.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never remained too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainlaws," a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
The Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street of the labour community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix brought hatred to the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys, they went around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
He was thrown at a watermelon in the car. "
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston, she wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education, "insulted rather than honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember this - they used to embrace the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins's daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudice, just like she did, with buoyant, trust and lines like: "How can any one deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand. "
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Yemenway appeared in the bookstores, reintroducing her into the American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville's most famous daughter went under the reflectors again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The idea raised from the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repaved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from central Orlando, you can sometimes feel like in a street of the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as that which was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
The outsiders who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things - such as the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for the bright red, still fear that her island community can be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of homelessness has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville just as Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,'" says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone's talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice being in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the bee-nest offices that are above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Kids for home delivery continue to resonate their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carry muffins trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between buildings of cargod apartments, like human mules, with 50 shirts of eccentric stamping hanging at a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning meal, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
The employees are still waiting to line up for their bagel to the carts of the sellers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4: 00 and 5: 00 in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the calm at the end of the afternoon in my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a tail of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not ahead of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or to make a deposit, but in front of the customer services bank, where all-life customers order their cheques, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker," and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places where they had been commuted, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a building society), from the credit unions and the savings banks of their hometown whose braces only work within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and since New Yorkers were heading home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachow, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that were standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescue on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and his head executive, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fiftieth and something janitor in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping to the tendero.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The commutation is done, I'm not taking any chances. "
Muslim tombs desecrated at the time when Austria is coming to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the right-wing extreme party for the freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the right-wing extreme party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signals that represent mosques with a red line that goes through.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for desecration of a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the extreme right-wing political parties made huge profits in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, some time between Friday night and this morning, in what the police think was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but the researchers think this may have happened because of the attempt to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which reached the Muslim religious when Ramadan month was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that hacked almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration veherence and some of their slogan were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the headscarf and burkas, and also expressed opposition to the foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties are committed to banning the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name, Paul Gend, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gend from travelling abroad as he did to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gaddi did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sexual offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the expected date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said that they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said, "Kent Police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said, "Kent Police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the county and to minimize any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassuring and pleased to know that they had prohibited Glitter from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the teacher off-stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer _ Photograph
No heels, no flyers, no opening suits.
The essence of the great teachers of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to get the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
To the side of the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when to find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, careless because they are not going to go on the scene.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatrical of some put on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" can be anyone but, by seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of passing on passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco. "
With the taste of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1,997 to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
These are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic base of the image, conferring modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the action of dance, singing or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which captures the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the leprechaun that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is present these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown in the sample.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people," the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to enter a moment into his life, be it a long or short moment.
I think within the picture the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that you sometimes don't know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true. "
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which is entitled "Flamenco-people" is shown at the Gallery El Photómata, located at number 20 of the street de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where you can visit until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
He is set up in places he still does not know and he deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to taking forward the new project he works in, a novel that has as its protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalists who lived twenty years in the Congo and went through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in its passage to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that it is dealing with today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that it should not write" the novel.
"If I were sensible, I would not, but I am going to do so and I hope to end it once," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thought and words that for four days he has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word party and met the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend," by Dickens - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a given audience that was very short of the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live more than he lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and redoing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced their vocation on the basis of their memory and what they are based on. "
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent," so he asked the writers "not to abandon the frivolity" and "to take responsibility" for their vocation.
The climatology undermines the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of grids
The grating celebration that closed the fertilizer of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoners announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the cumshot.
The weather inclemences have been boiled with this fair, as two of its three festivities have finally been unable to celebrate.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a prison in Castilblanco
So, only Friday was a celebration.
In him, the winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and went out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante salted his two roasts with greetings and an ear, which granted more the tidings than his atheist.
That's right, worse still was El Juli, who went through the "The Llanos" thing without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a work of relief, he won the bronze of a large part of the audience.
They're skipping a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hash.
Five to ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipal term of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they take the flight.
His load, more than two tons of hash, was not enough to stop.
They were persecuted and arrested by one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., as reported in a communiqué by the Basque Government's Department of Interior.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control at N-1, in their way through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were preparing to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, abruptly accelerated and overstepped control.
The officers began their persecution until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometres later in the archeon, when their two occupants stepped up to flee to the race through a forest area.
The ertzins finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hash flocks, so they proceeded to transfer it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, and the arrested person was also charged with a crime of forgery of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape the race as said, and to determine the origin of the arrested drug.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was transferred to police units to conduct the relevant proceedings and will be brought before the courts in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of some medicine
Actress Heather Locklear, popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California road patrol has been revealed to People magazine.
The witness has detailed that, at 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deep into the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and back, and when he went back several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who appeared to have not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who told the emergency services because he "was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol centre for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at around 7: 00, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former council of youth and sports of the City Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making deals in favor of family members.
"For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers," said Llamazares about the action that the party will have to adopt with which until now the councilman in the Sevillian Consistory.
However, the EU leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always argued that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein he stressed that training has "strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"May Blood," Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his film with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of interpreters.
May blood, with a mettle of more than two and a half hours, is released this Friday in the cinematographic rooms, to become in the future a miniserie for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood," which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid ordered him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the entire Community of Madrid has provided for Garci is a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorated and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "a Spain that has been struck by the wrong head to fight for, since, the struggle for independence has led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not have funding such as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice that of the Blood of May-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in most of his career.
For this reason, the director of Retiring has had an impact on what is his usual form of work, the setting up with the actors, with which he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and those who do not make casting, for it seems to him "humiliating" and to consider that "part of the trade of the director is to go to the theatre and to the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works."
Many of the interpreters with whom they agree in May Blood repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to the Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be made known," he said.
With this movie, Garci is not expecting prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer too.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in Eastern dance.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women's liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe from between wars fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was amazing."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell your life but to collect your spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetic, "he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in the "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was her student.
"Matilde makes Tortola the oldest, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I am very honored by it. "
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all its extension, and who are always in love with them."
The work also accounts in some way for the life of this woman who developed in such far-off places, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all of Europe, as she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's one of those women who have a huge influence at a given time and now no one knows and much less puts their work to value," says Bayon.
The show will start today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a newly married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reedition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: El chopo de luz," which was opened last May and which, after traveling through the various Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Culture Board of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta recienriado," edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Encso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them. "
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and from all over America, to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, they had a hard time giving him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that it was known that he was very sick.
It's still been a nuisance for all of us.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or to exaggerate.
A father of the cinema and the homeland had died at a particularly dark time, in fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem for the soils, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings left to admire you, it doesn't take to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It was an ideal for all, almost platonic, of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and earned causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his first-born, overdosed, to his brand of home-made and organic food.
A whole gift to a country that has had a hard time getting over a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another English, the daring director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no more or less the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand for probity and for a serious private life away from the cameras high.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but then was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful when he was probably left with the opportunities of not being.
"But why should I eat hamburger out of the house, if I have steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a dear grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race called it, and in my opinion it's been the worst race I've ever been in.
A sum of dispurposes that, of course, if you took it into account as an evaluation and I examined, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go for parts and from the beginning.
Dispurposes begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go first.
Which I don't think is wrong, but if they already make you go, they'll give it all away (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first dispurpose, go only for that) and (behind the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only 'S' size for the T-shirt (second dispurpose, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or have they decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper ones because of the crisis?
Well, things like this are a minute compared to the ones on the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we hadn't left the backpack yet, although once we got it, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait for more than 40 minutes, which met with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the shed.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the way out correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect career, it wouldn't go into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, it has shown a breakthrough of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the company's campus) taking into account what it hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the present according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that it is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him he'll be there soon.
All without blue pants.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been discussed well above a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essential instead of loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsshot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand.
It does the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but we have to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts just to run the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and each day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They need it desperately, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft's employee rest rooms, in Redmond, early this month.
In the refreshment machine a sign asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but in the end, rather by throwing in 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is getting more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to pass bill.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's' Blood Diamond ', as was Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's' The Godfather 'and is part of the uniform of the musculated gay parish.
And if we are to list star appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp mustache force that raised weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical male t-shirt in cotton, girded and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which they call the speaking angels, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles takes off all the others.
First, because of its imbuchantant name - although familously known as' Marcel '- it has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
"La Marcel 'stands out over the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention is paid to the fact that the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sea t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Garments designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them like underwear, though.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; I don't care about the candidate."
His huge resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than some beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the Mango firm does at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards than the Spanish sponsoriza house.
Warm and shy, he wins in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 1950s and 60s, and we have a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women dress up, combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and has a lot of common ties.
Since I was a little girl, I liked my clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to steal into my aunt's cabinets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I was always trying to take care of the way I dressed.
You know, we dancers like to make us our stylisms for classes and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when they give you the costume, that's when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You haven't been up to 30 in a while, have you been in a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that women are made, have experience and taste life with less mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological watch.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body asks me to, and I also want to be a young mom; I don't want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're looking forward to a number of shows you shot last year.
That's right, and I already want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, can't be.
I want 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ' to premiere.
See what they look like to you...
A few days ago you debuted over a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I got on a walkway to be a model.
He simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for his organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we exhibit - I took two pieces out of our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People are not aware of Naomi's tender heart.
They say so many things about her that, I who know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I keep that good part she gets involved in.
He asked me to walk for such a noble cause, but if he would ask me to do the pine, too.
For the benefit of women in the third world, whatever it takes.
Repeated alcohol drivers must install the 'alapocouk'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a period of one year.
The purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so the driver will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Fiscalia General de Segurida Vial, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Fundación Instituto Tecnológico para la Seguridad del Auto (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the motorists reported more than once for driving drunk again take the car.
The alapocock would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in the air that is spirated and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected, it is higher than that allowed.
The cost is higher than EUR 1,000 and would be borne by the person concerned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that 115 people could save their lives every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before it results in criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been piloted in some public service and industrial vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow for an initiative of the PSOE in which it intends to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 1740, the time envisaged in the program, the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling was landed at the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced the use of the hand as a visor to see the real couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official journey.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar on the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marines who play the honors' sage.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-cough', perhaps they had told her that in the DF she threatened storm.
They give a smile and a spade to the photographers before moving to the room where the official comment is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four big ones in the city, a Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best gifted of fashion
There may be no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there may not be a more exquisite living designer and bonus live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of the new talents of fashion.
It is equipped with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango window at number 54 of the Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost cried of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one's in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With the closeness of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a heart of grief and a heart of guts, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and a dressing of ELAH, which cut the breath, and of the arm of his son Louis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, by the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of his own design - and for dinner was transformed in a long black sexy dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they taught us the ballet rehearsal room and she, recalling other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a big plie amago.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace's dependencies, but he first taught us on the mobile phone pictures of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves on a bike - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked for no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the antistress number
There is not 1000 but 1000 more a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And in case it was little, they are all gathered in a book that will bring the relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7: 00 in the morning, but it's even worse to imagine being involved in the agitated rhythm that today's life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number goes up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from yoga positions, the classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each other's taste and minutes in the pages of a book.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the hand of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this' manual 'denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Talk asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about those who wake up very skewed by telling us something that happened the day before, but about children who speak when they are asleep.
The first time it happens, you might get scared, but it really doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somnilokia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of them was told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once in meseS...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep changes such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (peeing) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be so.
As mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overarousal.
It's a little unstudied, anyway.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be useful to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to see if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to get the child too excited before you go to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who are hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain internal calm.
This will encourage the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day you will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Even if he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation to ask him an interrogation to get information.
You will get nothing, because when you are asleep you are not aware to organize your thought.
You will also hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of to say that, with which you will be very careful how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory in its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good game, the team created many times of goal and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann, who was shattering the squadron with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front of it, we didn't let the centrocampist pass and we left only Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two times of Riahi and Temporale goal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53 ').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness long and will be forced to return in the cloakroom a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who went back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major flask, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will rodeo over Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who had been heavily disturbed last Monday by the entrances of several Breton and Normandy ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals."
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the rise in diesel prices, which marks a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elyseo spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of the sailors."
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to slow down the circulation in Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused stunts of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
"A filter barrier" has been put on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, tyres and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loira-Atlántico region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until the meeting this Wednesday that will take place to the ministry to think of possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support its movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen did not leave" and "they do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee, for example.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay charges on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the point of financial balance of a ship can be reached with only one diesel at a price of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died from a cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats that weigh in the world economy.
The fourth world aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivered devices, said President of Embraer, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies a lot on the Chinese market particularly to sell the planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would intend to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been taken out of trouble thanks to the American monetary authorities, aims to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper needs.
The AIG board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the AIG quales are intended to be separated include their air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., their 59% share in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer, and their real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, followed by the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the appropriate proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen in the Stock Exchange of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, that is the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, a technological dominant, went back 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded (extended) Standard & Poor's 500 by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives from the plane to save the banks that would have made it possible to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
About two out of three Republicans rejected their plan.
"That's not a good sign sent to the market, which the Congress sees unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of the Financial FTN.
"This shows the extent to which the market had this plan," Lindsey Piegza added, fearing that a project adopted within several days will be "too late."
"If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, the N of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions more," said Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight's economy and finance.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes, the fall of a financial institution is announced" in the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachow's banking activities by his rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, leading to emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis," the FTN Financial Analyst added.
The obligationist market went up dramatically.
The performance of the 10-year treasure bonus fell by 3.632%, against 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bonus by 4.161%, against 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House was another one to find out who has succeeded between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen considers that the performance of John McCain, although honorable, was not "quite" brilliant "to allow him to stop his fall in the polls five weeks from the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday grants five points of advantage to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), considers it to be the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them award the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of his same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts, "I still anticipate Bill Clinton this weekend.
The Septuagenary McCain demonstrated his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first struggle.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused on several occasions.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without disconcerting, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced its ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so," he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertising that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on the Americans. "
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said yesterday, in front of 20 000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a severe rain.
He did not say the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favours Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most able character to save the economy that is on the edge of the cliff.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," I thought, yesterday, the influential and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration mime, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would nevertheless reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the outbursts of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also noted that the eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudentes, both candidates evaded the issues that related to the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk," have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents expressed last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative.
A few hundred of Belarus gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closing of the electoral centres in Minsk's central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to manifest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator has to resign."
Some recognize not having voted: "for what, as they will do what they want with my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good eye on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the interdiction of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
"We have been put next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and at our home, is the executive power.
If some members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, regional meetings and proposals for legislation."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, comes into crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26 per cent of the voters in Minsk) favoured manipulation.
"Have you noticed the elections? Question Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two last political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to parliament, who are best able to agree to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has again been one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he reconquered the public's confidence that had been seriously emptied by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public, the Canadian government conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Kover, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to ensure that such a disaster did not occur any more.
While Judge Kover was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau committee carried out this mission.
As a result of Gelineau and Kover's reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all the other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, he recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence, "he said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebequese population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "trust is an extremely fragile thing."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were attending in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of crazy cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of Kover and Gelineau's reports, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we put in place exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of all doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied had meaning. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleide acid tests that allow direct detection of the presence of the virus and not of antibodies to the virus in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
The nucleide acid tests made it possible to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than one week.
We substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
So since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 and 500 000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern, "says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, as an example of the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant, "says Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
"The needs are increasing because the population is aging.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need a red blood cell or platelet injection.
The ageing population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that regroup on average only 3% of Chequequese eligible for blood donation. "
All persons with good health, aged 18 and meeting the eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it's hard to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since today's life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating his blood, "Francine Décary is grieved.
With a budget of $297 million per year, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eye balloons and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was previously considered as biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the putting on the bank of our very thousand blood sample of the umbilical cord and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Décary, who describes this cordon blood-taking program as very popular.
"Many moms are disappointed that they are not able to enjoy this," as Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact on the Semifinals
The impact of Montreal was qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory for 3-1 (4-3 in summary ends) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the series of quarter finals, in the Saputo Stadium.
The centrocampist Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90 ° minute of the game.
After the first time without goal anywhere, the centrocampist David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many times of goal.
Roger Levesque was the only che to unravel Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the round-the-round series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it for 4-3, but the Whitecaps however agreed in the semifinals for 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the free barrier shots in front of the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I anticipate the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the maximum in the first time, said Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (from the left), tries to get elected during today's partial election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force, staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec, seen by "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Great media as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plane" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space," which includes an agreement on the labour force with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the north to the 49 ° parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential," but did not give a term, amounts of investment, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be most developed above all is: in particular hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France," "is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us, "he insisted, to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built much thanks to its relationship with the North, he said: the riad to the gold in Abitibi, the Chebequese engineering, the James Bay.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added, having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the territory of the Republic of Korea, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion comes, I reiterate that position on the part of the government, "he said.
In addition, "with climate changes, we have to rethink our vision of the North," he said, talking about the north-west passage, which will be opened every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Québec party of Ungava), have already started consultations near 30 communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a meeting at which "a common vision will be given."
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new occasions of growth and development."
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival in the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to re-appoint the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay our party was able to forge the future," said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its implementation is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I anticipate being there," he trusted his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stressed that his schedule was nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the liberal chief with a platform that contained nationalist resolutions, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec demands in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the broad lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Quebequese party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy of the North of Québec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned to apply it.
If I had, "we would have made progress today," said Ms. Marois, next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said Sebastien Poulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is on vacation today.
Letters - A dishonest country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its promise and allows a child-soldier to live in inhuman conditions.
The only one who gets a false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: little does it care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We do not yet realize that, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, of our freedom and of our "democracy," that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants to be a minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government gave up what did the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In his September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company attempted a €6 million defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The result of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable amounts in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the almost unfunded pockets of the mining company.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will chew the opposition as well as scare whoever will dare to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by hitting a stick.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining company to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects the requests and support letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate by disregarding the views of the public?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word only refers to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that supports the authors and the editors of Noir Canada does it mainly because it rejects the brutal way of the mining.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge him, but based on civilized changes of arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-gag (following the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just placed a requirement with respect to the authors of Noir Canada, urging them not to use this word any more).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to hold a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the punishment of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's unmeasured persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the university world, but also to public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan that aims to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both House of Congress.
It provides in particular for better control by the elected of their implementation, for new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, for the new provisions to contain the number of houses embarked on the non-payment, as well as for a right to control the wages paid to the leaders of the companies of the Soviets.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiations marathon.
"We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
"Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances over the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been over very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last time they had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather in favour of the agreement, while not forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to come to this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain arrangements to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to retain their home and the one on the salary of the leaders of the state's surviving companies.
"When the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, we should not welcome them.
But these measures are necessary, "he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, Interrogated in another chain to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. "
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the dubious debts, the assets at risk and the invenables of the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credit before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a break-up of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe that we have emerged from the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the companies in difficulty are only secured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to soften the stamina for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take up losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will get shares in the sojourn companies that will be worth dividends in case of profit and that will be able to sell again when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargoes that concerned housing obtained from real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote by the House of Representatives from today and the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he was still not sure that his plan would be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both from the Republicans and from the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Commission, told his constituents that "with all the evidence, Washington does not want to understand."
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that is to profit from the taxpayers. "
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems in another way, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economic teachers, among whom three Nobel Awards, wrote to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and to examine carefully the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of real estate risk loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a voting right in the bank and influence.
It is just something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and over 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes for so long represented his triumph.
The American actor with a lovely smile had freed himself from his narcissist side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have made him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, 83 years ago, due to lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fasts.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked much like and was long considered a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic agreements.
The mixed bleeding often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No oversized ego, last quality mark.
Because he projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before winning in theatre, television and soon in cinema.
This man who militated for civil rights was also the car pilot who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a couple models formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well, are also missing with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death caused the vertigo to the cinephiles this weekend, while his big roles are intertwined on the black screen of the memories.
More than a half century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving through it.
Many memories return to memory as the charming cowboy-boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke your sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have moved on to the history of film.
This fighter Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable at Some Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice manpendant in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar to the best film in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat Martin Scorsese's character in The Color of Money, which was worth in 1987 his only Oscar among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
The times change during his career.
The young people know him mainly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), on Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as godfather of the Irish Mafia on Sam Mendes Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends that left the race quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its oars, its fasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in" the playing "and that judges his performance too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young than marginal galan: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a realizer, Newman revealed sides of his true unknown pudic sensitivity.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
"Among the many homenages that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened:" my life and my country were better thanks to their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legend career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a counter-state against Hollywood excesses.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the canisters of vinaigretta sauce, of the sauces, of the cookies and of other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The products of these sales were given to their Foundation for Children in difficulty.
Newman, rather than being content with his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag & amp; Co. invoice factory?
The criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will soon begin on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing significant damage fraud, in a business way, continuously and in organized form in addition to other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, the funds obtained in public competitive examinations were used for their own purposes, often justifying the performance of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in full about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public competitive examinations with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
For this purpose they obtained the stoneware in the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular stamps were made in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and they served as a model to make the invoices that he presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as the City Council of the Capital.
These invoices were signed for the most part by István Lados and his accomplice András Łri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel in the town of Badassonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however on the bill there were a hundred and thirty people.
But the great fantasy invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. gastronomic center because in the holding of books of it - according to the information given to the Public Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and showed him the bills, he knew that they were false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers also did not report that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes travel abroad, so that on the cash bill they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency's bill-issuing practice.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, despite the fact that travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with 25 but only 15% of VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended machine-made invoices however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "consignors" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it has been known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not make the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate invoice format, false seal - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued these invoices.
The forgers also paid no attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, that is why the one in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously issued the invoices.
Another group of the manufacturers of false invoices are made up of those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Buduestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices of approximately 5 million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeyő Egyesület Association, without real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later overturned the prepared invoices but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The next group of fake invoice manufacturers include those that have some connection with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of the Trio SL Delta with a fictional headquarters in Budapest, who dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
The company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Kft. Cash Investment in Kiskunhalas, which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also issued the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued in the name of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány by charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because, according to the defendant, they did not receive a job.
But he took advantage of these companies, as at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the Zuschlag-related organizations: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generácio.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Investment and the Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth 14.2 million HUF.
The Office of the Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10 per cent of the amount of the invoices.
This man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generácio and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
For this to not be discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably report in the trial - as they did in the prosecution - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing can be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done so far.
The question is: what is the interest of doing so? For perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even have been offended, since to ease his prison conditions he applied for house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the many perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least wait at home for the sentence, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of the overlaps: Why do we spend more money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
The neurologists and economists of the University of New York discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and apparently irrational conduct.
According to the study in Science magazine, people don't want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games the participants could make money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, by losing the game the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex was intensified.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention not to cause an intense reaction of the stratum.
To base his theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they win, they would receive 15 more dollars of prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss of the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one, the triumph was highlighted, and for the other, the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winning" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those so far explained the phenomena of the auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of the risks.
Only neurological visual methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation "- said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world, some 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and caused diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (for example with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with the blood and with body humors (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers protect themselves by means of a vaccine against the A and B virus, there are no vaccines against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, it is manifested by general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and on the target of the eyes, excrement becomes clear, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Annually one million people die in the world from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected people receive pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected people do not know that they are ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys the liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical monitoring, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when you experience some unknown symptoms.
The disease is cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the body, so it is possible to suppress contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by the viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
The scientists at the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the framework of this unique experiment they applied electrical shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain's scanning technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which together with the academics also participate scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a spitting instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the Armiño of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while watching the painting of religious theme or the other.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as "protected people," they reassure themselves and in their heart peace reigned. "
When they looked at the picture of religious theme they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such shocking image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you only have to find the right image.
"We should find a portrait of a person they feel very positively for, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality," Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question: what effect would it have for the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of its size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary produce even better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: it can be found both in people's pocket, as in the sky above their head; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather all the information in the world in a system!."
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the early phase of the effort to deal with all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt answered as follows: I would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the work that would be best for me?" - however, software will not be able to answer questions apparently so simple as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their web browsing, the wanted keywords, IP addresses and pages were accurately stored at the end of the search.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can revisit what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who care about watching Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear for punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that not only do they retain, but in justifiable cases they also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify paedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who care about people's rights, in May, were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, an electronic rights organization, successfully demonstrated in court that he was right in his dispute with the FBI: according to the sentence, Google cannot be forced, by any of the points of the constitution, to supply any information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain under the pretext of strengthening the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 web addresses and some thousand wanted phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and key words of the last two months.)
Thus, the opinion about Google is rather contradictory: it is criticized by those who fear to supply their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is damaged by the start of using Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "cutting-edge corporation," not its rival, the Microsoft, listed by its Windows as the conqueror of the World, however much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, or money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it can also be because the geek see precisely the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that was produced by one of the most mentioned key words in recent years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional traces behind us and taking advantage of the communication channels available, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young man can have a profile on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of his music customs, then they can be included in a follow-up system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, which automatically features the latest photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or the Picasa.
We can know numerous cases from which it can be seen that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs from the next morning of the common friends, finds out with whom her fraudulent boyfriend spent the previous night or can fire the employee of a company because she writes her sincere opinion on her blog about the management of the company: one thing is sure, the definition of private life was fully revalued.
A person's "online" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of the youth of our days.
And the one who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google's monopoly, can do it (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses the Google search system, but does not leave any prints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but they can replace Google's "online" applications, from text writing software to the image and reading applications of news with alternative versions that do not connect to huge servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible on us.
Public opinion almost hopes that openly the day that Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than the IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the AdWords / AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers will, however, find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the employees' protest after doubling the price of the company's child care, considered the unlimited number of employees' feeding too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked all information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to work, what if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir up the world: while some believe that the Google project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the United States Supreme Court, others fear of their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, a novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian that future, in which a man only from Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to clear the prints of the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, according to a well-founded suspicion, helped to clear the tracks of the crime - said the spokesman for the General Public Order Commission of the province of Borsod on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and they are currently charged with the perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to the reports of the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - can defend themselves at large.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is charged with the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim's 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was prepared long before to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime site.
The police have an expert analysis of the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which within a few months wants to sell 60% of the shares.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Böse have so far been offered.
Petr Kobligc, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, stated last week that among the stakeholders the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with this, in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
The experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of about 25 percent, followed by the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the ever-deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September."
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American President - the Republic of Rome believes - the President has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill done in haste, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor," which was spoken of by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more correct to talk about a "September 11 second."
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the view of The World, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congress vote, there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva points out.
Some states today can still throw life belts at the wobbling financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the domino still crumble more bank, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and to centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis are becoming more and more real.
The EU has so far failed to deal seriously with the crisis that goes on as a close-up to the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater evil?
The smart car imitates the flight of the beehive
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of the existing nature obstacle sensors?
For example, the one with the beehives.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the beehives gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the collision prevention system.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C-type robotic car management system imitator of nature, which was given the characteristics of the beehives, with the ultimate aim of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bee creates its own particular oval space that actually resembles our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of the beehives that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser-ray length measurement system.
It identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that is immediately transformed into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumps, changes the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system currently, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to dodge other bee.
This process should be done in an eye-opening and closing.
However, unlike the bumps, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the beehives to dodge other beehives, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and the acceleration also the fragation.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, meaning that they have a longer life span than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second should only process some input signals and react to the case.
It is not necessary to store these data or to react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No memories of gigabytes, or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately avoid the obstacles, which according to the Nissan's calculations, within ten years you can join the models made in series.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to its destination, avoiding the obstacles in its way.
It's already got a name for this very expensive child.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package law has been prepared and will be applied in several phases in order to buy bad bank credits.
In the first phase, half the money will be spent.
According to the time of the eastern coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight Saturday, the congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion financial rescue package in total, after several days of discussion - the Reuters reported.
"We have made important progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the American Congress, saying that the agreement needs to be formalized only in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the commitment, said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving the Wall Street, but about turning the car of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8: 00 p.m., according to Washington's schedule (that is, before 2: 00 a.m. Monday morning, according to Central European schedule), without causing a spectacular leap in the bags.
On the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization in 2008, the first Monday will vote for the American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all the $700 billion to buy low-quality credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, from this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, bad rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion will be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and credit fund securities, as well as other "poisonous" claims.
The purchase may be made in auctions or directly - the competent persons of the ministry have reported.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and are waiting for the help of the State will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls parachutes of gold.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition to the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank is retired.
By directly buying bad credits the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations only concern new contracts to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that a legal limitation on the income of the directors-general will be in force - said Democrat Barney Frank, president of the Congress commission, responsible for the financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately even be able to make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill over the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
"This is not what the American citizens entrusted us, that is, the taxpayers' dollars are not being protected," said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said: the measures urged him by the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will next year no longer require a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement to enter into force on January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
In his view, "practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the entry site will disappear, but tourists will have to register before leaving the country of origin.
From today on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by giving him the Middle Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the banks' financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major American parties, on Sunday, assured their support for the government's $700 million bank aid program, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The representatives of Congress and the administration, following several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced in the early morning of Sunday: a principled agreement was reached on the financial rescue package of the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and defreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the economic issues being brought to the fore, Obama again gained some advantage and the McCain advantage he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy for vice-president disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed the hope that Congress will quickly pass the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is at risk the employment, the saving of you as well as entire industries and the stability of the whole economy" - he said to a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain he explained that "we will all swallow this very hard (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable way."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister and the limitation of the executive's compensation, he insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted the minister daily.
Congress President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the congressmen will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the most conscious electors - says Der Spiegel about the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-in-law coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known politologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem for the whole Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was already expected for almost ten years was completed: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU obtained 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernization of the CSU in the province devouring its parents.
The sociologists are already 40 years ago predicting this, but in the rhythm they were very wrong. However, the secularization, the results of the education and the settlement of the Germans of the North in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the voters of the CSU.
Modernization also increases the potential and also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn electors.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was just the conventional groups of the citizens who moved the most away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the high-school and the graduates.
This is how the support for the CSU was refunded to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Vienna Conservative Daily: "Who with whom? In his article entitled" Party Presidents are very reserved in coalition matters "- it deals with the confusing situation of domestic policy after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens still do not want to consult about the coalition.
The elections were already held, everything now revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely saw anything of their deck.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left behind the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, at the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if you will choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must certainly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
The president of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," said Haider.
Járóka: We must break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevaliation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights protection organisations.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the Fidesz Group of Members of the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Gypsies are left out of the labour market in the first place because of their low level of schooling.
"Most young Roma have not completed secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role to play in the prevention of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues both among Gypsies and among non-Gypsies.
For the sooner a gypsy student starts school, the more likely he will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the European Parliament, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary in order to immediately accelerate the processes of school re-education, for this it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly implemented.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the possibility to guarantee the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year in the sign of the "European Year for Equal Opportunities," is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein will be made at the end of October
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off on the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial Prime Minister, are still in office, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent electoral defeat, will be decided at the extraordinary party congress to be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the so criticized duo let me see: they do not cling so much to their posts.
They sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who, one day after the "Bavarian tsunami," demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the social Christian union reached 60.7 per cent, instead now, a year after the hit against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 per cent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria, which gives 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although in the province of the South, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, they will certainly have to make a coalition with someone in the future.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors the Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was taken advantage of for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local policy.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role that until now has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU described September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor unless they are able to enhance together the CSU that played a significant role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide his disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlinese coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After the Sunday elections, there will be no opposition congressman in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the country's legislature of 10 million inhabitants, composed of one hundred and ten deputies, has no opposition over a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time "would allow" the entry of some opposition members into parliament.
So the ODSZ removed the boycott I originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of natural gas more and more expensive from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltrangaz, the owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians permission for having a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed rather emphasis on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday's primary report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the count of the votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition, there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - a month ago that considers the two regions to be independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich has told.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime is afraid to allow even an opposition to enter that parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, but rather tries to get the voters their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities are putting difficulties in the face of its distribution, but even so I see that more and more are supporting change among the elderly as well, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Because of the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that social security "is similar to the silence of cemeteries" - said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, contrary to the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe not in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is nothing but testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before starting work"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against the person who files and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This new development was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - Brunetta says - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister needs.
"A new season of responsibility and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism, "Brunetta stresses again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of the workers."
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and medials.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7: 00 in the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced of 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people to work in a year."
He added that the public administration needed to be more effective.
Italian, "which wage dynamics - the minister explains - over the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation pool."
For now, millions of public employees have come together to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the civil service minister shows the numbers, the least absenteeism of work for reasons of illness - writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'empty workers' is on the rise.
In Italy, millions are the correct and productive civil service employees who have joined together to declare war on the illegal rules of the decree. "
In particular, the Tar will respond to the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extension of the time frames in which the medical control visits of the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that the white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths in respect of homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Amil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of the accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State exerts his "great appreciation for the continued partnership in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness."
"A truly shared 'enough' has been manifested in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand, the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the many initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of the young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the focus on the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini House has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the awareness of each of us and imposes a determined effort on all institutions to put an urgent end to it."
"Data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight positive walk, but this does not make the number of white deaths equally impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not really want this" downward trend "to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention decreases that the tragedy exploits.
"We believe that at the general level too little is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our view - it has emphasized Mercandelli - to improve controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school. "
"It serves a further effort - it has added - in that it concerns the communication and the awareness of the public.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency. "
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary care provided for the victims of work" and the "referral of care to which the system is being directed in recent years."
"The aim is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance - it has added - because the fate of the accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time."
Mp3 readers under accuses, risk hearing
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission refers to the fact that in a statement published in Bruxel it cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the apparatus at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable musical devices and high-acoustic phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific evidence - it follows the responsibility Ue - there is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness among consumers and to provide this information in the public domain.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and have the way with the new technology. "
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the high use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
"The scientists - the executive has concluded - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and interested parties that measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical and related devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to limit these damage by far using solutions such as reduction of levels and time of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee is of the opinion that the users of portable musical equipment listen to high volume (more than 89 decibel) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the limit currently in force for the maximum permissible noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the way for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it is closed, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome," which was established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Thermas de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission components will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bollo" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to emphasize Germany - it must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be supported.
There is no single position of roles, just the will to have a place to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March the work will go away, because this experience must have a precise time finish.
In June - the mayor has announced - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome. "
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno says: "Everything depends on the work that will be done by the Commission and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are again manifested.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future. "
The President of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, not a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to make the best minds that the capital expresses participate and reason."
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "would not be limited only to the present communal confines but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but also "considering the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political sense that he is interested in being independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and brought relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam. "
The attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
has written a Miami lady on a web site: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he won the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!. "
They are actually attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the electors: will he be a good president? And there are also the polls; they all say that Obama won and with a good advantage.
In this case, too, there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote we will know well to whom the American patriot will vote.
One side of the American mentality comes out covered to the last.
"Say what you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasoning, the winning weapon for the democratic is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home in the ass.
In Iraq, there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to do the bags.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak point.
Whoever will take over George W's position will have an enormous duty to unfold.
It uses, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
While today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as most people understand it is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism now prevails over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
At the local level, the executive group is 65%.
Imprisoned against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in hope "to do something good" for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between the one who runs the newspapers - that is, the directors - and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some this has to do with "job safety."
The executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For the media staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it,".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, are "sick" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROMA TRIBUNAL, COPPOLA DANILO SEES IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is inquired about bankruptcy in the field of research on the anti-pact on the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process, last week, he obtained home release, transforming her into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentioni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate be able to travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given a contrary vote) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the representatives' camera against the $700 million salvation plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this one, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
It gives us a confirmation of the New York Times yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, in fact, has become impotent with the vote of the one who spoke at first.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not just here.
Whether in the United States as in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that are solidified and exposed by the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-update, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual status-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance which have, if, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is to say how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they have little to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different State strategies.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you reach the court it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of resources to finance you to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market likely and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of technology always more sophisticated, of immaterial, while we were convinced that the global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to make the accounts more and more with the unmaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, see, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So who is sovereign, certainly has many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune to live in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I get to the second news that but I presagitate a fracture.
Those who say Territory, State, Government inevitably say Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of one who can take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, of the economically relieved species inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disquieting sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
The conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites up to now, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the end, to have done the same time and to be more strange to the views of the majority, seems to advance ever further in various places of the population.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of dislegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which are manifested in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective humors of recent times, from the conservative departure in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also layers with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today it is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially in a disproportionate way.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk on the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future to walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a body of 100 kilos on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY - The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the paws of the gecos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence.
The tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sanding paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "it is easily removed from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the engineering faculty at the University of Dayton.
- "This material could be useful as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Capes to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Capas yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are heat drivers and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
Another INVESTIGATION - Berkeley University, California, is also engaged in the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that self-clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that frescoes associated with the assumption of some medicinal products David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of American Chemical Society in progress sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, cancelling the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients.
The grapefruit juice was already low because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some antiarrhythmic medicinal products, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
RISGOS FARMATIS - The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago aligning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that it caused from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drink in the case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being assumed.
NOT ONLY THE POMELO - According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milano: "These findings are generally pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicinal products that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly to the doctor or pharmacist, "said the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a New York Times editorial noto.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, on those days che crababa Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been reproached to the economy, but which has now been revealed to be exact.
"I'm surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from public attention," Krugman had declared to the fine of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank Executive Committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist," but also a divulger with a "very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism."
Open Office, I echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that looks to attract always more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year from the voluntary developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Attention also to the multi-operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is in a position to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic posta, or the possibility to import the PDF file into the graphic processing module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
You can always create "hybrid PDF" documents on this front, which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the drafting of texts, each collaborator has given a color in the comment for a better recognition at the review stage.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download 300.html and is added to the English version that was on the screen since Friday.
In addition, for Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent home or to work.
And if the issue of free can be a hook for the dissemination in the houses, it is in business area that Open Office tests the suite, tries the big bet, already having several projects made in the public administration and in the schools.
And there is no lack of even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Print, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eat in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphic module.
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million download, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the best shirt of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also they from the Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl's blood champions enter between those carried out in recent weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratory.
If the anti-evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind the back of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, with the best climber's shirt being awarded.
IMMIGRANTES: NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy's country of migrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants "welcomed with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racism? Is that what the New York Times is asking in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy on the basis of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there are "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the North League. "
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation called for by the Lega also tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine people is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked by the Pope is that by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has called for the State and the church to work together to combat racism."
Students who are the victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants' union, to rent an individual room, could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to support - explains the head of the office studies of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has completely deformed the market to this point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for the residents."
In addition to the fact that in most cases rent offers contain a number of violations: type-free, unregistered, non-canon-limited, sub-linked rent contracts.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary, which, through the review of tax taxation, can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350 / 400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is made economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed, 300 / 450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for one bed you are served 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
In the smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city's economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rent to students and non-community is more frequent, there is a subsequent anomaly: a 25 / 30% increase in the canon to foreign students compared to Italian students.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic rooms
The historical cinematographic rooms close by favoring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effective what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalizing the cinemas, which with the birth of the large metichs on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion," notes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that was won 20 years ago by cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial film room and the nostalgia for the way to live the cinema that he lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of the merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay for the most part are all the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 cinemas less, following Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the one responsible for its disappearance is the compromise of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are own that have recorded the largest number of new meticon cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 be in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romaña.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city room closes, not all its frequents are willing to transfer to the metichs.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year. "
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about the closures, decided to repair with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala be in the historical center that at the periphery.
The proposed rules include tax facilitation measures for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers can enter the limited traffic area and will have special parking rates.
"It is an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope other cities will follow the Bologna example by setting up other measures.
It is true that to contrast the extra power of the metichs, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and the image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was always important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradiso cinema," which I had thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of the already closed Nazionale way, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so that I do not see the signs blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side. "
Lazo between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
There are heavy charges that the judges of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate give to the mayor and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafiosa association.
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the name of the boss, already convicted of criminal association mafiosa and to compensate 10 million euros.
"By neglecting any legal and moral rule, and in good sense," the procurators wrote, the two local authorities had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed the Mafiosa family - the Jews write - to enter officially the municipality's interior by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes that stay clean. "
This morning's arrests are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cut of heads of the Piriomalli Mafiosa family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been solevated from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the mayor, from the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the shooting in May 2006, had been elected as head of a right-center coalition.
I blow up a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the project on road A3.
From the ambiental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, "the availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Pyromalli clan, uniting the public administration elections about the interests of the Mafia families."
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage
It is an exterminated field that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the great world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of raising energy from the movements of the sea has been under consideration for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of oil was low, in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was removed, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world's power need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be the currents and the tides.
Giants to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in North Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy, it is always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy - he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the ha to the American oil colossus to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US energy commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a rather important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to perform new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create great problems for the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology with greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boas system united between them.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type under development, waiting only for federal approval, aside from energy, could serve a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking lot, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, turns the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long cast of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Energy, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
While this is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is especially about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that approach the coast, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
